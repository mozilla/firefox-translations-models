# Firefox Translations Models: remote_settings

A CLI tool to upload language models to [Remote Settings](https://remote-settings.readthedocs.io/).

## When to use remote_settings

The `remote_settings` CLI tool should be used when language models are added or
updated within the repository to publish them to Remote Settings.

### Example: Publish a language pair to Remote Settings

**1) Export your authentication token (see [Authentication](#authentication))**
> ```
> export REMOTE_SETTINGS_BEARER_TOKEN="Bearer ..."`
> ```

**2) Ensure your files are present locally, and not stored remotely via [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)**
> ```
> git lfs fetch --all
> git lfs pull {path_to_your_files}/*
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires [installing](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#installing) git-lfs.

**3) Unzip the model files you wish to publish**
> ```
> gzip -d {path_to_your_files}/*
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires [installing](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) gzip.

**4) Inspect the metadata of your to-be-published records by using the --dry-run flag**
> ```
> poetry run python -m remote_settings create --dry-run --lang-pair {lang_pair} --server {dev,stage,prod} --version {version}
> ```

**5) Publish the model records for a language pair by removing the --dry-run flag**
> ```
> poetry run python -m remote_settings create --lang-pair {lang_pair} --server {dev,stage,prod} --version {version}
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> At this time [versions](#arg---version) are manually entered by the CLI user.
>
> For example, if you are publishing records for a version `1.0a2`, and `1.0a1` already exists,
> you will need to input the version `1.0a2` manually.
>
> In the future, we would like to support one or many of the following:
>
> 1) Bumping versions relatively via the CLI, e.g. `--version {bump-alpha,bump-beta,bump-minor,bump-major}`
>
> 2) Retrieving version data elsewhere, possibly from the model names, paths, or JSON data generated alongside the models.

## Creating model records and attachments

The `create` subcommand is used to upload a new model to the Remote Settings.

## Examples

Create a record and attachment for esen/vocab.esen.spm on the dev server with a version of 1.0,
but mock the server connection to inspect the record data and configuration without uploading.
```
poetry run python -m remote_settings create --path models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm --server dev --version 1.0 --mock-connection
```

Create a record and attachment for esen/vocab.esen.spm on the prod server with a version of 1.0a1,
but only do a dry run to inspect the record data, configuration, and server authentication without uploading. 
```
poetry run python -m remote_settings create --path models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm --server prod --version 1.0a1 --dry-run
```

Create a record and attachment for esen/vocab.esen.spm on the stage server with a version of 2.1b2.
```
poetry run python -m remote_settings create --path models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm --server stage --version 2.1b2
```

Create records and attachments for every model file in the esen directory with a version of 1.0 and upload them
to the prod server
```
poetry run python -m remote_settings create --lang-pair esen --server prod --version 1.0
```

## Authentication

To authenticate your user with the server, you must export you token as an environment variable called `REMOTE_SETTINGS_BEARER_TOKEN`.

You can retrieve a bearer token from the Remote Settings admin dashboards.

* Dev: https://settings.dev.mozaws.net/v1/admin
* Stage: https://remote-settings.allizom.org/v1/admin
* Prod: https://remote-settings.mozilla.org/v1/admin

On the top right corner, use the ðŸ“‹ icon to copy the authentication string

## Required arguments

There are three required arguments for the script to run:

* `--server` - The server to which the record and attachment will be uploaded.
* `--version` - The semantic version of the record and the attachment.

The final argument is either of the following:

* `--path` - The path to a single file attachment to upload.
* `--lang-pair` - The language pair for which to upload all file attachments.

### Arg: --server 

Determines which Remote Settings Server will receive the uploaded record.

Models can be uploaded to one of three servers using the `--server` flag:

* `--server dev`
* `--server stage`
* `--server prod`

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading to the `prod` or `stage` servers require VPN access, which can be acquired
> by following the steps [here](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/15761733/Mozilla+Corporate+VPN).

### Arg: --version

Applies a semantic version to the record.

Record versions follow typical semantic versioning used throughout Firefox,
and records will be made available only in certain channels based on their version.

* Alpha-version records, e.g. `--version 1.0a1` will be available only in local builds and nightly builds.
* Beta-version records, e.g. `--version 1.0b1` will be available in all builds except release builds.
* Release-version records, e.g. `--version 1.0` will be available in all builds.

### Arg: --path 

Uploads a single record and attachment located at the provided path.

Model attachment files are stored in the `models` directory at the root of the repository.

The `remote_settings` script derives metadata from the name of the file itself.

For example, the file named `trgvocab.esen.spm` will by of type `trgvocab` with a from-language of `es` and a to-language of `en`.

> [!NOTE]
> Files are stored in compressed gzip archives. They must be decompressed before uploading.

### Arg: --lang-pair

Uploads all file attachments in the directory associated with the given language pair.

This argument will take a language pair, e.g. `"enes"` and upload all files in the relevant path. 

The path itself is based on the provided `--version` argument. 

* If the version is a release version, e.g. `1.0`, the script will search for the language pair in the `models/prod` directory.
* If the version is a pre-release version, e.g. `1.0a1`, the script will search for the language pair in the `models/dev` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Files are stored in compressed gzip archives. They must be decompressed before uploading.

### Args: --mock-connection and --dry-run 

Before uploading a model, it can be useful to test your configuration before committing.

The `remote_settings` script offers two levels of preparation:

* `-m | --mock-connection`
* `-d | --dry-run`

The `--mock-connection` flag mocks the user authentication and connection to the server, allowing you to inspect
the derived metadata of your record and attachment.

The `--dry-run` flag will attempt to connect and authenticate with the server as well as output the metadata,
but it will _not_ upload the record and attachment.

Using these flags is recommended to ensure that your setup is correct before you upload attachments to Remote Settings.


### Testing

Tests can be run via the following command:

```
poetry run python -m pytest tests
```
