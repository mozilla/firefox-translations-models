Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
According to suspicions, these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organization aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of the criminal organisation was detained in Mijas, the province of Malaga, Spain.
Three men were arrested in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal organisation, according to the collected data, and two are members of the criminal organisation.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles were clearly divided in the criminal organisation.
The purpose of the criminal organisation's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal proceeds," commented Vahur Verte, the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We do not exclude the increase in the circle of suspects in the criminal case in question," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," prosecutor Verte commented.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted for nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, the long-term work was realized and we simultaneously detained the suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officials were assisting in their detention in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civilian guards.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far unambiguously indicates that men who have been suspected of being at large can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is expected to surrender him to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in the context of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial criminal proceedings are conducted by the Organised Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police and led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court found Slava Gulevich guilty of blackmail in 2005 and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he started blackmailing in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded a monthly rooftop tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and incended judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accused separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikajev Criminal Organization, from whom the proceeds of 80 000 euros were confiscated, or a court judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade of illicit cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Ida-Viru County and Southern Estonia.
The amount of the confiscated criminal proceeds there is nearly 71 500 euros.
Success in these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues and prosecutors exchange evidence with foreign colleagues every day, and if necessary, together they carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against state-discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missour, which is valid until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the state, given the entire series of suspicious race-based events that have recently taken place across the state and have been highlighted here."
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning, both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are unequally largely minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They're being pulled to the side of the road because of their skin color, they're being beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never been so complaints before.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with the crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black drivers' cars are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white people.
“The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends, and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in the state's cross-section in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have started to use this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: what could everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have a malignant course, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkle and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, Epidemiology Advisor at the Health Board, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grayish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter sign of the disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may not be known.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory test data.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and progress for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar highlights different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the feces of an infected person to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and when using drugs.
The risk of contracting hepatitis A, or the risk group, includes family members and caregivers of the infected person, people suffering from chronic liver disease, people having sex with an infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people who travel heavily and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before consuming food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting, tattooing, piercing, using household items contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shaving equipment), donor blood, having sex with a person who is suspected of hepatitis, and from a hepatitis patient to a foetus/neonate.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people for the prevention of hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver diseases, HIV-infected, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringe-needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of a condom in case of dangerous sex or avoidance of sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation schedule in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items, donor blood, having sex with a person who is suspicious of hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/neonate.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, family members and caregivers of the sick, health care workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, persons infected with HIV, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The preventive measure against hepatitis C is: refraining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringe-needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of a condom in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other body fluids, syringes and needles contaminated with them, sexually and rarely from an infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by faecal-oral drinking water and food, including low-cooked beef, fish and clams, donor blood, shared syringes and from the infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers can become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high levels of disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E are compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-cooked beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from drug use.
Although the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the final round, the 34-year-old found strength in the final stretch and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, dragging with his wife Tania and children on the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth consecutive 5000 and 10 000 metres double in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie dives into O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold. The extraordinary story of the portrait of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer, much deeper than the birth story of a work of art in Vienna at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more in history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information could have been used perhaps by a harder axe of cuts, a narrower topic would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to have more influence.
At present, there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in his painting "Lady in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftereffects in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you into the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the bubbling life, and whoever founds himself in the Austrian capital can effortlessly imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel like a gram more cultured.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where incurable syphilis proliferated and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every double-sentenced brushstroke adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of Traveling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet was not drawn to all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "The Lady in Gold", it is hard to believe that towards the end of life this noble lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order at that time cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a country house with a good location.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love affair with the model was suspected, the sugar magnate was not discouraged.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story of the portrait of Gustav Klimt, portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of his work with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravenna in the San Vitale Basilica, and the researchers think that the glorious mosaics seen there from Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his Lady in Gold in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (in 1907-1908) another gold painting, The Kiss, was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity between the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think I owe him a debt to remember my friend Klimt to make his handiwork available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings for the Austrian Gallery.
She bequeathed her jewellery to her niece Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from the "Austrian Mona Lisa", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed at the drawing exam.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him into the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in the Maria Testament had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find the works that the Nazi Party liked from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Some of Adele's homework, but not those of Klimt, were also suitable for Hitler's personal art repository.
Sixty years after the Nazi arts robbery, a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer began.
It should only be noted that while "The kiss" is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, the "Lady's Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen in the Neue Galeries in New York.
And before going to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan to go see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around the Nazi and Jewish theme more than the painting sold for 135 million dollars after the book closed, and model Adele Bloch-Bauer revolved around.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family fate story - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree, which was originally mentioned at the beginning of the book, facilitated orienteering in the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the pre-swim, Gold was very close to his own 200 m backstroke record of 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to a week ago in the 17-year-old, when the Canadian Junior Championships were set at a time of 2.16.58, reports Priit Aavik's Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to reach the A final.
In the final, he completed the distance with a time of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new top brand.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) was separated by a little over half a second.
Gold came third in Estonia's all-time rankings and his fresh personal top mark is Estonia's fifth-ever result.
Young hope for the future is still starting in the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle, and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won a silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time this distance was swung by an Estonian woman was in 2008.
Only Estonian record-holder Elina Partõka has been swimming this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a top mark of the new Estonian season of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has only swimn this distance by one hundredth faster.
He reached a personal peak in the 100 m backstroke, receiving a time of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of the relay swim.
In the distance of half, he achieved only the seventh place, when he swam in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
The time for vacations has come - that is, relaxation also for US President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the presidents to take out one of the most holiday days so far, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day holiday at a self-titled golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have already spoken out on the holiday for a week.
They blame Trump for resting too often.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend time on weekends in the villas of Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days.
George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
Trump is quick to forget things.
A few days after becoming president, Trump said on the show "60 Minutes" that there will be no time for long vacations during his term of office, as much needs to be done.
He also expressed outrage over Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president tweeted: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting the heads off for journalists."
According to White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
Instead, it is officially called a work holiday, during which Trump does not have time to read or other favorite activities.
There was also another reason for the work leave.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the west wing of the White House will be replaced, and therefore all personnel had to leave.
The Oval Office and other presidential offices are also located in the western wing.
"I don't think any of you want to be in the west wing in August when it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," White House spokesman Lindsay Walters said, adding that the president would continue to work during his vacation.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you will get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook - Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "free speech can be taken away from us, and in mute and silent, we can be led to a massacre like a sheep."
It brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogani's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts by at least 450 people who published their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And towards the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued him for this.
The governor's officials labeled the action null and void, and online comments were full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it does count.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval rate ranks second among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtlessly responsive windhead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained strictly true to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite as a key tool in communicating with his constituents, for example, by vigorously presenting his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the governor's page ‖ is a public forum officially marked, managed by staff who receive a salary from taxpayers' dollars  blocking people visiting is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers or people full of anger.
The Post was talking to several real people that Hogan was blocking.
And that's what they are, real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all obscene.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not incite anger, but on real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a comment section on The Post's news story.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, instead of admitting that they are a large number of worried citizens."
What the governor's official called "directed spam attack" would probably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than it used to be when, in order to do the same, it was necessary to send out workers so that they would collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first government official to be criticized for getting Facebook and other social media channels toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark verdicts on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the Loudoun County Council of Supervisors ruled out the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington time, affordable postage had a similar effect as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quadrupled, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers beat him up for his management.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington's decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected in the context of the online George Washington mail collection project, he was buried in the cabinet under petitions criticizing his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the next three days when East Lothian's Renaissance Club golf courses take place at 25. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the last round of the Archerfield Links last year ahead of the last round before the surrender to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and will play the role of a tournament ambassador instead of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I saw the Renaissance Club be built, and now we see the club shine in all its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players see the path in their best shape, it is in a glorious state.
Jerry has done a great job of building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows the track to be perfectly presented."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending his championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It's accompanied by a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the competition calendar a year after my win.
It's magic to come back to this area.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories from last year, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always be wearing in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour of Seniors towards the beginning of this year when he turned 50, will return to the competition on his home soil.
This is his first event in Scotland since attending the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," said Orr, a Helensburgh man.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing again immensely and shown quite a good game of golf.
I'm happy with the progress of things so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots competing, the rest of whom are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, and parking costs 5 pounds for a car with one passenger and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-prone land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she won't use the stove.
He rarely uses the pot.
In the wooden cabin in the regent capital of the Indonesian retard of Papua, the regenty of Paniai, the housewife places the sweet potato called nota in the local language directly on the place of the fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken off the heat and eagerly put on the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor �� �� no furniture  and there he also does his daily household chores, for example, washing laundry with cloudy water from nearby swamps.
The role of the toilet is performed by a bucket in a roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous – most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are also soldiers here.
"No one dares to go to the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare glimpse into life in the Papua Highlands. It is a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversy referendum, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands in front of the occupant's forces.
The movement that prompted the Dutch's doomsliftment quickly directed its rage against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is both a distant and an abandoned place. To get here, you need to fly from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire for 90 minutes, and then take a nauseous five-hour journey on a car.
There is no public transport.
The city, which has a population of about 19 000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned different shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been hardly any foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuas of Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only carried plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy is one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold-filled land.
Just 100 km from the Pania, a mountainous province of about New Jersey with a population of 153,000, is home to the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, which is owned by Phoenix-based company Freeport McMoran.
In 2015, Freeport extracted about 3.1 billion USD of gold and copper from here alone.
In addition, Papua can boast of consumer wood stocks estimated at US$78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the Papuan suffering, because they require a powerful suffocating presence of the Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid approximately US$20 million to local military and military units from 1998 to 2004, including up to US$150,000 to a single officer.
Papuate's efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ruthlessly handled.
Human rights activists say more than 500 000 papuas have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesia's military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the Papua tribal highlands were subjected to mass killings in the 1970s to the size of a genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The 2016 report of the Birsbane Archdiocese "We will lose everything" contains testimony about the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shocks are especially common) and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even more tightly turned off because Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Kalimantani, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, which is served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local papuas," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai, who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
"The indigenous papuas  papua mama-mama [women]  will therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokow, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address their inequality and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of the 29 constituencies in Papua, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential pallet of Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, Paniai was in a slump just two months after Jokow took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs by the Enarotalis fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from the dark.
The horrified children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with their rifle handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot into the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
About 1000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance from the Papuan honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and military.
In the event of an outcrop, soldiers were sent orders via internal radio. "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them," the official document said, which has been seen by TIME magazine, but which has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the elder of the Kego Koto district in the city of Enarotal, felt an impending threat and called for peace to be kept, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house in bright colors.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
Alfius Youw, a local man, said his cousin had witnessed the shooting three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes told TIME magazine, using only one name like many Indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of his precinct because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with death," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for Papua police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and heavily injured.
News of the killings didn't arrive in Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to engage in abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case right away so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to solve crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, excuses followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything is resolved by law."
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of human rights crimes over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with gloomy distrust.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Yacobus said Paniai was afraid to dissect the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came to find me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring Paniai regenty in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he went into an altercation between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the police, at which point the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured people's entries.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dani and damal tribes living in the green central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), an army of rebels that defend the rights of the Papuans, arbitrarily carrying out attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from the Panyah, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state", has arrested the Paniais in recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as the "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for locals.
The bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food themselves �� mainly sweet potatoes, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between indigenous papuas and new migrants, which has arrived since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport, has deepened.
The few jobs that exist go better to educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, strict restrictions on foreign media remain.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow relevant practices" although they had been given a rare filming license.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asia Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokow's election promises to remove restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report on the easternmost troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua are threatened with new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling gaze in the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's close neighbours.
In March, the Six Pacific states ‖ Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands spurred the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a variety of widespread crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian foreign ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations, Jakartas told reporters: "In Indonesia, democratic order and press freedom still apply, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who was at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, asking for "we want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuas do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to imply to Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a threat from a predatory army, they are struggling with misery because of poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other papuas, consider the vote given to their Jokow to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting of Paniai managed to withstand the last symbolic insurrection -- they buried the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be established, they at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
The fire crashed through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to escape this 337-meter-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called Torch, or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the shouting of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident told Reuters who called himself George.
According to Dubai's civil protection officials, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings worldwide.
In an investigation carried out by the Torch Board after the 2015 fire, it was found that the most damage was suffered by the facade covering - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior surface.
Police in the United Kingdom say they believe that the insulation of London's Grenfell Tower and the facade panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed some 80 people.
See: These phones will probably become bestsellers in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were released in the spring, with new hit phones expected on the shelves in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, Tele2's Marketing and Sales Director, this year's flagships are characterised by innovative design, eye iris scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution display and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart, was a great success in the world of technology.
Autumn promises smart enthusiasts even more fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and higher water and dust resistance.
He added that based on the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models that will probably conquer this year's sales rankings.
These four top smartphone models will hit the store shelves in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit the store in mid-September.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what it can do with it.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to the iPhone 6s, on the occasion of Apple's tenth birthday, the new model is expected to be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colors have been mentioned: black, white, rose gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple Design Manager JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye iris scanner, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-order for the all-new Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There have been a lot of rumours that the new Galaxy Note 8 is about to look like.
I hear that even more business users are designed for, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionalities.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide-angle and the other a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first attempt, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, the flagship of the Nokia 8 is still missing.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
Nokia also speaks of an aluminum body and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with an equally good or better camera.
There is speculation about Sony's new model that its screen is at least six-inch.
What the reality brings, we will see soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which this year will take place from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of telephone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on paying for the border wall
The Washington Post has unveiled transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked the wall with him over public condemnation, saying, "You must not tell the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees going to Australia was "ridiculous," "fustful" and "stupid." He argued that the agreement, made under the Obama administration, would make him look like a "jummer" because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call, telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in a case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of regular bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the Tartu bus procurement, because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Law Service.
This is a public bus transport procurement within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed the decision of the Tartu Circuit Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this matter.
Although many people on social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night's sleep and the whole city is full of drunk partygoers, there are also many who do not have a bad word to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the partygoers were so polite in the store!
I didn't see any blurredness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the Pärnu-like Laine.
"It's nice to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which is like hibernation in winter," he adds cheerfully.
The wart from the beach does not disturb Laine's sleep.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached the walls of his home.
"But I hope to hear," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to Õhtuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - after all, it contributes a lot to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is glad that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The party noise doesn't bother the woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach has livened.
And it's nice that people are moving, and it's been like this three times already," she says.
The first time I thought it was a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he thinks.
However, the buzz on the beach is common for summer capitals.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little city," says Harri, who is basking in the park.
The noise and the noise have not vibrated his rhythm of life.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
There is no crowd of loud music.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite.
"Of course, they've exaggerated a little with bottles, of course, but young people are young and my God - give it a go, but be human and we'll be fine!" says he.
By this time, the coastal residents have travelled somewhere away, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like such a buzz", says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
The sleep of his family is also not disturbed by the festival music, although last year it sounded even further this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that we actually hear quite well there far along the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
The British education company Pearson said Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent, triggering another restructuring program to solve the business's impending distress.
The losing jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will most likely be laid off at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 jobs lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (US$394 million) under the third-cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectation for the year has not changed since a 1 percent increase in sales revenue to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year was announced.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the latest in the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-borne self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, everything is in a stable condition and treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the ever-growing force of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), is a serious source of concern for the forces stationed in NATO's Bagram in Qarabach.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shiite district, mainly in Kabul.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people -- a military attack that has resulted in the most deaths in the country since U.S.-led forces repulsed the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
Correspondents say suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA overturns decision to postpone smog regulation after actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has overturned a decision to delay the imposition of an Obama-era order requiring states to limit smog-inducing exhaust gases, one day after 15 states sued the agency for this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 ozone determination" late Wednesday, saying it would demonstrate the agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe we need to have a dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone ozone determinations, which measure smog pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the stricter air quality standard, to be reduced to one year into October 2018.
The 15 principally democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. Trump said it was part of a more comprehensive growth boost plan.
But these efforts have provoked reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA's website states that inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung performance and increase the risk of respiratory diseases" such as asthma.
There may be a party for German pigs.
German pigs and cattle could have a party as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer.
This year, it may happen that weeks of rainfall before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is suitable only for feeding animals.
"Wheat quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could go into animal feed, which is double that of conventional, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to any kind of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany suffered rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many have their eyes turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
The harvest has not yet begun in most of the region, according to local buyer Ceravis.
"It's pretty difficult days," said Frank Deckert, senior trader at Ceravis, from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, i.e. the clever quirks of interior design of the Finns
Beautiful nature plays a role in the interiors of the fair homes, because through large windows the magnificent views of the banks of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, our northern neighbours strive to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The Finnish wood use skills as a construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty items deserve admiration and adherence.
Both the builder and the (home) designer can find stimulating techniques and smart solutions in the fair houses.
It is clear that combinations of black, white and grey shades, when complemented by wood tones and houseplants, can be very spirited.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, because the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
The night before today, the line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix gave everything on the main stage to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd was really twisted during Garrix's performance - they sang, hugged, danced self-forgettingly.
When Garrix finished, they spread from the beach in Pärnu to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught on Weekend for three days.
I'm sure you're some of them, so look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course to face in the nearest-future boxing match in the most attractive boxing category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, up to Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the weights.
Garcia handed her right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you success."
Lomachenko will defend his belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 on the ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "perfect measurement."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down to light weight.
And he has to move upwards with a lightweight weight of 61.2 kg], and then we can fight.
The fans want it.
Let’s offer them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to view it. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to have Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class towards the end of this year to make it possible for next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who are also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their February 23 round of the lightweight title round.
"Watching this fight could be a charge because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "majest fighter" and could go see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind, the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing in order to challenge them.
“It’s a fight that is waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
From which corners of the world are they moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PBGB) extended and issued a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or stay with their families.
For example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, but last year the number was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While ten years ago nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year, in recent years this number is beginning to come close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, compared to 675 the year before.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing the most in Estonia - last year, 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and study opportunities are sought in a country where the community and, for many, the family is already in front of them," said Kristin Rammus, spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although in total, the largest number of fixed-term residence permits have been issued to the latter in ten years.
While Ukrainians come here mostly to work, Russian citizens come to work for family migration.
"Taking into account the historical Russian community here, they are also likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted an Estonian residence permit have moved to, there is immediately Ida-Viru County after Harju County," he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them have married a European Union citizen.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to settle in Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have resided here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage the survival of adapted people.
However, a residence permit for a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer following whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular last year - the applicants were still holders of gray passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of settling in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come to Nigeria to study at the universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to study migration.
In their case, too, there is a rule that where the community has emerged in advance, it will be easier to add others," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, the same amount from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
While about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit a year, this is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if you think about the citizens of the European Union, the migration will remain at about a percentage point," Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, compared to 13 792.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the people who move out and in are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those leaving.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative with 2000 people last year.
Estonians primarily travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery and tulle
The bottomless box of ideas is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you will research and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem to some to life, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much shine you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can live your life special.
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this reasoning that made the plan to take high fashion to the countryside, between forests and fields in Estonia, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
Mammu's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where a royal defile with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the pose is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you by hand.
Most of the audience just came to explore, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they will be impressed!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion creations.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-meter-long red carpet full of beautiful dresses all over the street, it seemed that they would never finish!
Maria also does not recognize the fashionable that the creation must be presented by a supermodel, she will be happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, I'm always backstage to give things the last touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't let me stand by the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who not only wants to play the role of representation, but also to be in everything by the hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process of playing with the details, discovering.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
The thing is not limited to design, also styling, logistics, organization, organization - everything must fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
These hours will be tremendous for the fanatics.
I can't tell you when my day will end, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
Many times it has been said that there is magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The rich tulle lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp on U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian subgroup tournament was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale has run out.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do", commented Martin Müürsepp, assistant coach of BC Kalev/Cramo, the only basketball player who played in the NBA, to beat the 61:75 of the Estonian U18 basketball boys.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and received so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack either, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up defenses.
In defence, however, they managed to hold their hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It knocked the team's feet off.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to Müürisepp, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the opponents.
In the last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Athleticism and close insistence, which was our weapon in the group stage, now turned everything against us.
Today, we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In general, good words can be said about the whole team in the tournament, to this day they were a single strike fist.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent had not been met before.
The cup has always been confident and still played out today, but it seemed like he was tired - he has borne quite a burden.
But he made some pretty beautiful moves that I've seen in training before," added the instructor.
The girls' basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters in three quarters...
In the U18 age group, it is not only the European Championships B-Division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, was in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter the score was still 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes did the opponents take their foot off the throttle and the period was tied at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, in the third 1 point...
At the same time, the Estonians initially hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, followed by 25 pieces from the game, then one in three and then another 21 shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 shots were caught.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
The number of balls was reasonable during that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a shooting capacity of 33 percent and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day Portugal's 83:56 superiority had to be acknowledged.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine clearance group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to replenish the stock of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships are preparing to return to sea and give crew members the opportunity for a couple of days of vacation.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be prepared for future operations to search for historical explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training carried out by them in local waters illustrates our integration with the allied forces," said Commander of the Operations and Planning Division, Commander of the Operations and Planning Division, who is in the capacity of the Commander of the Navy's Navy.
As of 29 June, the NATO 1st permanent mine defence group will be led by Latvian Navy Lieutenant Commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the group leader from the Estonian Navy Officer Lieutenant Commander Johan-Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also has a group lead staff.
This half-year, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy's mine hunter Sakala.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's Permanent Mine Control Group 1 is a readiness unit belonging to the primary rapid response team, which the alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
4. - Until 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Convent will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was founded 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic Society, this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet productions from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" will reach the audience, and the programme will also lack self-production, which this time will be the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "Seasons" by the same international creative team who in 2015 brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation" to the stage in Pirita.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It is greater than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It is a festival whose enchantment takes over and never lets go again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the maestro Eri Klas's shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been of great help.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it all is passed on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me the strength to go ahead with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic Society.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written for the story of Astrid Lindgren will be presented.
That's "Karlsson Flys."
And one curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
Apparently, he has been living in the soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, certainly.
Such work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a lot of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, that is, how I meet each new day.
And such a conscious tone, keeping positivity and actually smiling at myself in the mornings in the mirror, significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have practiced it especially eagerly and it works.
Smiling activates the brain and raises tone.
It's not just a buzzword.
I don't think people know half of the things about their bodies yet, which the universe offers them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
It's almost an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the conductor's office?
It is, clothes need to be replaced with more comfortable ones.
This is the little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have the opportunity to rest before a big performance or take a little nap.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before I step on the conductor's office.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here you can discover for a not very big friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the fun video with Risto Joost!
New results of Swedish asylum-seeker age assessment tests published
In Sweden, an accruing applicants tested a medically as their age with a novel approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicineverket) started the tests towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were created to assess age more accurately during the course of the asylum application after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has released a total of 2481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) was rated 18 or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Institute estimated that the "may be 18 years old or older" to be tested.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "presumably younger than 18".
The tests are only used if the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of previous months.
"We don't see much difference from the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were rated older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been lying about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, the person had directly claimed that he would get 18 this year.
This medical method of assessing age, in the course of which X-rays of wisdom teeth are taken, and MRI of the knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose duties include assessing the biological maturity of people to find out whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of an inaccurate child being classified as an adult is low.
At about 10%, the risk is if the person is a little under 18."

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old hammer thrower, made a beautiful debut at the London World Championships, finishing in 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower at the World Championships, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately finished my average result, in the second (62.80) I took too much risk and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my throw and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's World Championship debut ended in a good 18th place.
The rain did not disturb the Organ, because he trains through the winter at the TUT stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little smile.
There was almost a full house of people at the London Olympic Stadium, did Orel perceive people around him or was it able to switch off?
I sensed it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds to it - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with his World Cup debut and he still has a lot of good competitions waiting for him: "I came here with this season's 32nd, last result, I finished in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm twenty years old and I'm at the World Cup - that's the only thing that matters.
I take with me a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
Governor of West Virginia announces party change
West Virginia's Democratic Governor, Jim Justice, announced at a gathering with President Trump on Thursday night that he was switching parties.
"I like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I tell you, having prayed a lot and thought about it... today I will tell you, to the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The gathering was full of joy.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play a second game."
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump scored 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
It is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Thursday night announced that "the change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent the country from improving again than working for it."
"Only 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history -- Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is end-to-end and unable to find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there are a lot of people, there are a lot of people injured.
Urmet, who is in the medical tent at the Weekend, told Õhtuleht yesterday that they had to hand out quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, twisting and slight falls.
Of course, head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to help a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also a fracture of the leg.
We have also done stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, we'll send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the festives ask the medics for a painkiller to treat the hangover.
Coe praises Russians' honest apology for doping scandal
International athlete Sebastian Coe said he praised "Russia's Thursday Fair Apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his ban on competition for the country is correct and has a firm goal to fight doping.
He apologized "to all athletes who have been snatched gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competition, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," Coe, the president of the IAAF, told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself admitted that they had had quite difficult times and would do everything possible to restructure the federation."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for reinstating itself.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the group's proposal that now is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always proceeded from the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the violated system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF's working group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only is the electric car revolution significantly changing everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies are not helped.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but in the future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will increase in the era of electric cars.
This year, the decisions of the UK, French and Norwegian governments have raised their stakes in the spread of electric cars, which promise to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars will be sold in two decades than cars using petroleum fuels.
"For some metals, it changes everything," said Simona Gambranini, a commodity analyst at Capital Economics, to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has been increasing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than a conventional car, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore is recovering from the growing electric car trend on copper price rises and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage company, the winners from the triumph of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already reacting to a changing trend.
This year, the cobalt has risen 70 percent on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also become 14 percent more expensive this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 percent in London, having exceeded rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American from price rises.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who need to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is the power-supplying battery of petrol and diesel car starters.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to it, which could overcome a drop in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metals analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the form of lead price movement, the effect of the unfolding trend is not yet noticeable.
Lead has become 17 percent more expensive this year, making it the best metal in terms of price rises among the major industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems for metals in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metals brokerage Triland Metals.
If the demand for lead drops, it will happen slowly.
This may happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries when starting engines frequently, is estimated by the International Lead and Zinc Research Organisation.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand already in 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world’s total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has appreciated by 13 percent this year as increasing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce ultra-light car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium.
"High-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, reported the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many commodities currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not have high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, commodity analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, the head of Uncore, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than all-electric cars in 2025.
The high hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year perspective is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos have developed hydrogen cell-based cars that depend on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Brunet, an Exane BNP from Paribas.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July after a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the hometowns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How does football's finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from making a world record transition from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Whatever the consequences from the UEFA, the governing body that is in the power of the European game and which has the power to prohibit the teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still waiting.
The 2011 UEFA Fair Play Financial Regulation (FFP) means that PSG will have to prove at some point that the Neymar transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) for the Brazilian to buy out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will be tens of millions a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to a French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to spend such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-state lineup, considering that the team is funded by the family of Qatar's energy rich.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot to recruit players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out with their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into big debt in search of success actually deal with cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners should drop the support.
Since 2011, the FFP has been focusing on tracking their losses instead of the debts of FFP clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then make large expenses to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP, which will last until 2018, clubs can suffer losses of up to 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being disgraced from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is a supervisor of the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for the Neymar overbought clause as a single payout, they will be able to split this amount for accounting purposes throughout the term of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, which is why it is possible to show the transfer fee as an amount of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
On the occasion of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were punished by the worst sentences.
PSG was fined 60 million euros (at the time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to outsmart the over-regular financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be accounted for as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was blown up.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service may come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Cup, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties imposed on PSG earlier mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed the transition of Neymar with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros in profit in the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of around 542.4 million euros.
The data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, commerce and shirt sales.
The club expects at least a 30% increase in turnover due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset about the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to stop Neymar from the transfer, arguing that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that PSG belonged mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the country is funding the club.
"This is the result of ownership rights and it has completely changed the entire football scene over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
“If the club is a member of the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests to have such a large player represent the country."
Norwegian, a cheap airline in Norway, has a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have pushed the boundaries in their field and been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee
Along with the expansion of Norwegian's geography, the circle of people who earned the place in the aircraft wedge has also expanded.
The selected individuals include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.

Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, which was called the storm of the century, caused major damage on 6 and 7 August, primarily to Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County.
In Northwest Estonia, the wind speed during these days was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from a curved tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and cracked, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from the houses in the distance, recalled the old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu in an interview with Eesti Loodus magazine in 2002.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted collapsed.
But what do you support with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water was splashing through the windows," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station apron had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw the same way among most of the people in Haapsalu until the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with a crackle and a crackle like a war.
Lääne-Viru County was not particularly affected by the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also great there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped from the face of the country, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured at up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In the evening of August 6, a little girl had shouted: "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!", wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The building of Põlli Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed so much during the storm that it was later decided to be demolished.
The August storm was not endured by the constructions of the Türi ski jumping hill, which were not later restored.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967, that cleaning up towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could be involved in cleaning.
Grain fields were also heavily damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party early society must be the inspirations and guides for both restoration and harvesting."
Hurricanes can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for outbreak winds in Estonia will last from November 2, 1969, when the wind speed of Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
A measuring instrument broke on the island of Vaindloo, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort in Tallinn's beaches.
"When there's no weather, there are people on the beach, and if there aren't, there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
There are seagulls on the North Tallinn Stroomi beach.
They are offered melodic competition by a tractor that buzzes at low speeds, which ploughs stripes on the stripes on the slab.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimeters, picking out sea debris and the debris left behind by people: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is nice, then there are people on the beach, and if there are not, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, head of the beach cleaning works of the private limited company Haabersti Haldus.
It's 6:30 a.m. and the beach is busy cleaning, because at eight o'clock the place has to be in order for people.
Usov is on duty from four o'clock.
After Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beach.
Garbage collections have decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what they do for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was set up, it was broken the next day.
They are already keeping what’s on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is cleaning up sea garbage or plows washed ashore.
For example, on Pirita beach, 400 000 tonnes have to be transported during the beach season.
"It's an incredible quantity," Usov notes.
Another large category is household waste, or everything that people leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-kilometer Stroomi beach strip has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much trash.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that there is a fifth less garbage than it would otherwise be.
The third species is abandoned things.
Most of the time, it's children's lives.
As this time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Usually they come out more, but that's a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
The garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haabersti administrative services, admits that the screening of the tractor is disturbed by locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
However, this work is impossible during the day.
In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, similarly to Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has much more work to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more plows and stones and harder to sift sand.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that garbage is being talked about on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi beach, is unforced to enter a discussion group between a journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a dirty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled garbage bags upside down," Martin reports.
Although it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their behaviour, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with trash cans and, for example, put the covers on them to prevent at least the birds from visiting there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi beach.
The city will take care of this.
With children's squares, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be that roller skates could only drive on one road," Martin notes.
Findings of treasure hunter in Stroom: coins, only coins
The morning low season has come to use the 40-year-old Dimitri, who as a treasure hunter combs the beach with a metal detector.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been doing it for a year and haven't found anything valuable yet," Dmitri says.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri's treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throw in the trash.
Usually there are coins.
"There is usually no gold, rings and such," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as poor economic growth and easing inflation have softened speculation about rising.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains sluggish as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted to keep the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that an increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years, and that financial markets may need to increase borrowing costs higher than expected.
Members also voted a year ago to partially withdraw the mammoth package that boosted the economy as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a term financing scheme in February that will provide cheap funding to banks, although it said that a 15 billion pounds more supply is now expected under this scheme, which is 115 billion pounds.
In the protocols for the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household income will continue to have an impact on consumption."
As regards the rates, it was reiterated that in order to mitigate inflation, "some tightening of the monetary policy" is necessary, to the extent of "somewhat greater" than expected in the markets.
The stock market is currently predicting its first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that all kinds of jumps are tiered and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to the forecasts for May at 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8 percent in 2018 remained.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened rising hopes for rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% over the previous three months.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to gain a little momentum at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to welcome households suffering from rising inflation and wretched wage rises, saying that the situation would get a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit in incomes in the next few years, but a significant recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for consumer costs.
The decision comes a year after the rates were drawn 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to weaken suddenly.
The bank estimates it is likely that it will take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest decision, there was a growing demand for raising the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July, three policymakers demanded an increase in the rate to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to June 2.9%, although according to the bank, it was as expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excessive growth compared to the 2 percent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokers at Coreco, said: "Given the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more and more competitive again as lenders want to work and hope to end the year in a positive way.
The stock exchange seems particularly advantageous for those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without a service fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is about to prescribe HIV drugs that have caused conflict to 10 000 people
Since September, patients have access to "transformative" HIV prevention after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England announced that public health care is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - a tablet administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Court of Appeal backed the Supreme Court's last year's ruling that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that local authorities should be financing the drug.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed this move unveiled Thursday as a "new massive intervention" while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a "reverse moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, there will be more clinics before the program is being implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are a sufficient amount of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and NHS England signed the contract to get the drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is widely consumed and applied.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of humanity's greatest health problems for more than three decades."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if aimed correctly at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, will have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.”
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is launched quickly and that no HIV risk group member is left out.
Now that the drug of the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on the road to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Public Health Shadow Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and severely delayed after months of delays and dragging the government's legs.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring about HIV prevention and the cessation of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial across the country is introduced as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity in Estonia increased by 12%, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the next day's exchange price difference between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failures of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour, and the price increased by 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the Nord Pool power exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved between Estonia and Finland in 75% of the previous month's hours in the direction of Estonia and 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
In the remaining nine percent of the hours, there were no transactions between the two countries the next day.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved between Estonia and Latvia from Estonia to Latvia 99% of the time, and in 73 percent of the hours, the total transmission capacity was in use.
According to the transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the exchange price of electricity in August could be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, increased last month and transactions took place at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per tonne.
Living high - half-floor and smart design tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker passionate property innovator, traded her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Court.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed up her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
“Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface,” Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be the equivalent of the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex arrangement - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demand," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architecture and design studio based in Erfan Azad's Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to make sure that the height of both the upper and lower spaces were correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, along with plenty of dramatic elements.
The semi-floor overlooks the glamorous living space below from the old-fashioned Retrouvius window with copper light.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver details and the retro Serge Mouille luminaire emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatricality, spaciousness and brightness.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror leaves the impression of a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The possibility of closing the kitchen part when not in use adds charm to the living room, creating an idea of a glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, the unique fact about this kitchen is that it is a garage type retractable door.
"It took some design effort," Erfan explains the door with steel reinforcement from veneered MDF.
"It has a counterweight, so it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," says Erfan.
"A real estate agent enters an outdated form of room and performs calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and that thus help to create an emotional connection with the home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cabling in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring the tongues."
This shows that a good design and increased area will help to make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they could make you want not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
It is not except the amount of money earned that is forgotten by any ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is a version of the business world of "House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's manner of speaking is similar.
As the film goes on, the less the frame-house element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers begins to stand out more and more.
A life-changing experience for the main character is the son's illness with cancer.
Now we have to choose between work and family life.
The son, who dreams of an architect, makes his father think about really important things like faith, goodness, love, and even the disaster of the twin towers, on his walks to the great buildings in Chicago.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, it feels like the filmmakers have been guided by the goal of the audience to be sure to cry, because even the viewer with the most callous heart can't hold back the tears in front of the suffering of a cute cancer-sick boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his work and does a good deed to the old man seeking work.
Now I bet with myself in my mind - if the film has a happy self, I will reward my insight after the movie with coffee, but if I am wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that I will lose coffee - when her husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes to the room in the hallway in slow motion.
Instead, the son has been wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now you have time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really do it.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House chief plans to limit the flow of information that reaches President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in more level water.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on her first day of work, she pointed out a key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which she planned to solve  the arrival of bad information in the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information must move through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if she was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have also tried to do so, and they have failed to tame Trump with monitoring her media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits haven't gone anywhere.
“When candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also featured in the overstuffed publications,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaigners say Trump's key to controlling Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes praise."
All right. Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that the rest of us don't know, that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory without these interventions.
We're probably never gonna know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
When his assistants were able to save him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people try to advance their own interests without exception, conveying to Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the entire course of the story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of strategically questionable value.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is this:
“Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may respond to negative press, especially information leaks with adverse effects, explosively, obsessed with identifying their source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printed copy to internet provocateur Charles C. An article on the Johnson-owned website GotNews.com that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of several information leaks."
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter due to mocking, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's also been falsely accusing and taking them back in the past.
Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-HR chief Reince Priebus and White House office chief Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump."
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
He may turn out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who have come from abroad to the capital are not eager to get permission to perform.
Many foreigners come to the centre of Tallinn to make music.
Those with whom Õhtuleht spoke admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near the Viru Gates who had brought the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians with dreadlocks and broken clothes were backpackers, who could use a shower.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the group played a song with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while one man next to her juggled three balls and invited passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a screwed-up joint himself in peace of mind.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and the balls, said he was playing in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the group's performance was to collect ticket money for a ship to Finland in the evening of the same day.
When asked if they asked permission from the city to make music in the Old Town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most of the time, promises are given for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we ended up at the Viru Gates again about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians' house and driving them away.
The group moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Keskus to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet, and the third had even carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be a city government permit to perform.
"Of course we don't have that," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros worth of bonds in July under the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area, and the central bank's bond portfolio grew to a total of 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not disclose more detailed information about purchases.
In response to the interpellation of members of the Riigikogu, Hardo Hansson, President of Eesti Pank, has previously explained that the asset purchase programme of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest elsewhere.
Purchases result in lower-risk asset yields and motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, under the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys government bonds of its own country, and bonds from other countries are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the allocated volume.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds from June 2016.
From June, both Elering and Eesti Energia will buy bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaires' district"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored a council-dug ditch to win back the field away from their villas.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field as a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were kicked out of it only in May, not being distracted by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guard, squeezing their vehicles through the unstoppable part that was left on the footpath.
The furious residents have cursed the Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there Monday night after they were pushed out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council must be shamed so that they take action, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away, and now they're back again.
They came last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on the streetbrook road and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council if the council can't even stop it."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time, the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the grassland in the rumination."
A representative of the council of Solihull said: "We are aware that a campground is unacceptable in the land near Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with the Solihull police. We will take the necessary legislative measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to collect evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival will be visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that the world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival's three days to the fullest.
However, he admits that real people in their field have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, they bring home the absolute top names of this genre of music - this often does not happen in our region," the Minister of Culture says.
What kind of artists do Saart speak the most at the festival?
I consider myself a relatively elderly person, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
According to his record spin, at some point all of us have twirled our feet," he says.
However, he also brings out several other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players: starting with NOËP and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high," he says.

Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism from car manufacturers
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering software upgrades for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Tuesday it would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European carmakers have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles to companies by automotive companies is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under in-depth investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of cherishing powerful carmakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, who silenced the use of so-called scam devices, which made it possible to adjust the exhaust gas reading to comply with the regulations for the duration of the car's testing, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not safe from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused the installation of the Audit system in order to circumvent European emission requirements, thereby extending an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a big blow for Volkswagen, with a luxury car manufacturer generating a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for 20 000 euros.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy the flags of the European Union for the Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag will be awarded to 570 educational institutions.
The flags are intended for indoor display, they must also be made in high-quality printing equipment indoors with a tunnel confirmation, ERR news portal reports.
The flagpole label bears the text: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
According to the Ministry of Education, the estimated cost of 570 flags is 20 000 euros, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
Journalist murder highlights growing threat situation in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered under the guise of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which seems safer: either bring the children to the office, which was the target of the grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allied".
They ask reporters to give names to each column  no evidence is needed, impressions and intuition are enough.
A whole list of villains who make it dangerous to report chaos in Mexico are suspected of being on the payroll of a government or cartels.
There is no pause for breath from violence, and the more bodies accumulate across the country, the more of them are made up of journalists ��According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since the swearing-in of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25 have been. 589 journalists have been protected by the state after attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed so far this year.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be felt everywhere  On the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez pointing to the middle finger hangs with the inscription "Justice" and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic panama hat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to handle journalistic cases, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely go to trial.
Riodoce continues to cover the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderer data and justice, a meeting on security is of great use, Ibarra said.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as the reason is not known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state's capital, Culiacan, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates to "twelfth river".
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in the Culiacan.
But there is only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields because rival clicks are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person or even several people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the graveyard is full of abundantly decorated double-drug kings' mausoleums, which are larger than the homes of many.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to how only one cartel is leading the seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and manager of Riodoce, feels the immense guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel frontman competing with Guzman's sons and fighting war with Damaso Lopez, in February.
This piece of writing may have pissed off the sons, the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid in another newspaper editorial office covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was forever there.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create a Riodoce by selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said Sinaloas "was unable to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained notoriety with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a print that they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AAK) for his courage to follow Mexican drug stories wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said when accepting the AKK Award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to take on the task that comes with the profession of journalist  another way is to play dumb.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths, or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective longs for Valdez, a joker who cursed like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office across the street to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same desk.
Now they ask if his love of routine became fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt themselves about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like messing with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things should not be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the toxic community of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to the toxic community of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly wondered if these police officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whose governor himself had labeled as unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous countryside, where the control is in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce this week's edition covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of a brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government funds on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew  the restaurant is a favorite place for both drug traders and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in widespread cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how Guzman's son, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for a column in Valdez to get information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have already known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sleek physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
A burnt body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal all over the country and are scribbling the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On this day, Bojorquez is away in Washington, Washington, trying to gather international support to establish justice in the Valdez case.
A day after Valdez's death with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of snooping on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked him to shift the government's actions from reflection, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were "limited" by organized crime, co-culprit government officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who are in a team of organized crime.
Last year, the media surveillance team Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks to police and state officials.
"In Mexico, you will die because you want to be silenced," Ramirez said.
Murders are obviously blood-curdling.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his cut-off head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to shoot as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez newspaper publicly spoke to the drug cartels with the editorial "What do you want from us?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a nerve-wracking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to look down the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico apartment in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that covering up a drug business scares him.
"Mexico is on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and sipped beer when suddenly everyone's phones began to vibrate.
According to confirmed reports of gunfights between rival gangs and security forces in the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by the cartels found in the region.
From the sidewalk side, reporters posted the news using a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
The next day's front cover needed to be changed.
The sirens were squealing along, another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez was peeking towards the police officers on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce traced him.
"How could you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when, on the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it feels like a shape, although quite scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings in connection with the incredible rhino-size creature discovered by the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his skin covered with scales was reddish-brown in color, and his past had been somewhat "complex".
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best preserved armor dinosaur that has ever been found" and "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation in the bog of researchers who describe it as "really significant".
This scaled vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of this type, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, it was worked to excavate an animal from a 2,500-pound (1100-pound) plot of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you squint a little, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
While studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant-eater, although covered in scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with many scales used red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a shading technique called counter-eclipse and is also used by many modern animals.
This allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid enemies, according to experts, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for it.
This 110-million-year-old creature belonging to the Nodosaur family first came on the news in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory technician at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7000 hours uncovering the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a counterectope - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower one.
Although a counterecting is common, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borealopelta is much larger than the animals with the eclipse that live today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to hide instead of confrontation as survival tactics.
However, most of the modern animals using the counter-eclipse – such as deer, zebras, or armadilles – are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nodosaur had to work hard to survive.
"The vigorous hunt for a dinosaur covered with a huge and abundant scale shows how dangerous the Chalk-era dinosaur predators could be," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thereby reaching the sea with the flow, where it sank backwards to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to extend far beyond the inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaled leather, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretal age.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to squint your eyes and it feels like he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge carnivorous dinosaurs - theropods - wandered on Earth.
Although the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of its terrifying predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
Researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed away after death in the sea and it mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and scales, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long squirrels broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this scaled plant eater adventured through the present West Canada until a flooded river washed into its open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve its scales in great detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the lumpy armored plates along the dinosaur skulls are still covered with skin remnants.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "Such a degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The fossilized skin remains still cover the lumpy armoured plates on the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to it and five toes are extended upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just a day after traveling to New York, it sat St. Louis resident Airbnb through a rented room on a bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He came across a post from his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old youngster, and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
With a guide @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
St. A rapper from the Louis area broadcast a live tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later saw a tweet again in the evening, which this time reported a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father were handed down and kept a sign with the inscription "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, he said, scored a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder that we are used to and that we might call typical."
I felt the creeps at the time.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson the next morning together.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose Streets?"), which will premiere in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of those who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a crown with it on their heads - drove towards Ferguson, they talked again about what they had been talking about many times before that morning - about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her in such a way that she does not personally experience blatant racism, she is no different from another black girl.
I feel like I'd do him a disservice if I protected him from the world."
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road - a place across the road from the police station that had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was not ultimately charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put together food bags and helped share them with the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," he said, noting that when he was from Missouri-St. A student at the University of Louis, he was president of the Minorities Association of Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no organizational experience.
It all just worked out.”
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met with one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
The question arose in Ferrell's mind: "Are you trying to document what's happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white people - come to the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already shaken hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for activism in relation to prisoners on death row.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched for years by the crew of the film "Whose Streets?" after Brown was shot.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm portrayed."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about a "redeemer guide, but a community gathering," as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished film.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing people in black must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrell's story emphasizes and refocuss the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who came up with #BlackLivesMatter after the killing of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, are homosexual.
"Gynoemous women in the leading role have generally maintained the movement," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black homosexual women must carry all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
However, he argues that "this is not some kind of equal opportunity-building type thing" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who exuded the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was directly on the front line, because living in such nodes as a black homosexual woman is at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The suspended sentence imposed on Ferrell for blocking the road during the demonstration will continue for another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, just "threat-free."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has etched in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 Ways to Get Over a Hangover After a Weekend Party
Some of the stronger husbands will find that what's wrong with the drink party, that's what help.
Or are they based on the saying "avoid a hangover, stay drunk."
But this is just an inevitable postponement and a decent health bump.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today's Weekend party or any other party tomorrow and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Down and on top of the alcohol, after the big party in the morning... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids when it consumes alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are washed out of the body, and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a drink, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
You should definitely not go to your grandmother's house to break the trees with a hangover - this could turn out to be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk will help the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to get well.
Give the body energy back gradually and carefully.
If you're already vomiting from yesterday's overdrinking, you should definitely not try to load a large, fatty steak into your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that quietly invigorate your body.
If you already suffer from health around noon, you should try broth, for example.
And a little later, a squirrel.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from the last water.
Water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver must deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and thus lose performance.
In this way, you will ruin your liver even more, and in the future, the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already ragged stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It's pretty much the same as walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
Make fun.
Talk to your friends and fellow sufferers, do simple stupid things and laugh amicably over yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not drive the hangover away, but they are definitely more fun to endure the after-echoes.
One day, the hangover will cross over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee sought as suspects in murder
Police said a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who has become suspects after finding the body of a man with deadly stabbing wounds in a luxury Chicago apartment is being sought nationwide.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants for arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on first-degree murder were issued on Monday for alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to the warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and, when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building, found a victim with several stab wounds on their bodies.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene and investigators were treating the stabbing as murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K., Vice President of Public Relations at the University. In a statement sent as an email, Cubbage said Lathem had now been temporarily suspended from work and banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Assistant in the Finance Department of Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in a statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help the U.S. research facilities in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the communications department at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to surrender themselves to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are working more and more intensively on determining the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, the suspects are helped by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police descriptions, this was a gruesome sight.
According to the Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said the security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on a chronology of events and identifying the victim's background, and will explore various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute."
Startups that help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were revenueless.
The answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs the 75-employed E-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products in San Francisco.
So he called outsiders to help.
New types of human resources startups are emerging to help companies figure out how their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software with a specific goal of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with an anonymity and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, he has gained much better insight into what his employees think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it offers a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment punishing those who dared to speak out.
For startups like Glint, having an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global area of management, regulation and compliance may be worth more than US$111.7 billion by 2020, according to data from the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Colorado-based startup in Denver that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity in the background of Uber's dubious reputation this year.
The Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been snatched by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of regulations and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the headquarters of the corporation, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, a general adviser at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practices that did not previously reach executives who operated in offices in other cities or states can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the staff's holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said the companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations over the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media became mature" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being washed online in public.
"Before using the technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been there to support both start-ups.
In February, Convercent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the value of the accumulated capital to US$47 million.
Glint was invested in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments will come as no surprise when we take into account the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely tables.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is vice president of the general benefit and employee experience department on LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they’re supporting.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in work culture.
However, this data is useless if the company's supervisors do not do anything with them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will lie ahead.
And if the changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, this can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business management company, who has seen how companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't get to the end, the employees will think, "Did you really listen to me?
- Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?" "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly surveys among the staff, has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is collecting new data on employees and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry known for its high staff turnover.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you're losing people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, the gross domestic product per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is due to low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few eurozone countries where the real GDP per capita has approached the EU average in terms of purchasing power," the central bank said.
Although the goal is that the total output of the economy per capita would be equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita accounted for only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of the respondents thought this about the economies of their countries.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the double-day workouts will make the Bruins' days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when a bunch of UCLA footballers stop to chat on the edge of a new practice field on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs from the first day of their training camp effort.
For much of the team, these deadlock minutes offer a midday break.
Players attending the summer courses will return to the dormitory for final exams after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel double-day workouts to reduce players' loads has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are over on Friday.
For this reason, the first three training sessions of the UCLA were scheduled to start at 19:15 to fit into the already tight schedule of the players.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared to the previous season, and for the first time during the six Westwood seasons of Mora, the trainings take place during the summer courses.
They have 18 scheduled training sessions until August 20, before official preparation for the September opening game against Texas A&M begins.
Mora said he was in favour of a change in the NCAA rules, although it would add another item on the agenda to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days, and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break through this ordeal; they work hard, they are nice young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA will make training closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from a nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a high-end hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have passed the gateway surrounding the defensive network.
Starting this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by players from Bruins, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with available rooms during the season.
"We're putting security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a training from there.
If you have a recording of your training, it can be a pretty good deal.
But we're using security there and in the 8th parking lot.
We do our best using what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place.”
The Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition, which was born to the Center Party, the election coalition of Use Tallinn, which was created by the merger of the forces of Maria Kaljuste, which was expelled from the Reform Party and the forces of Maria Kaljuste, which was forced to leave the Conservative People's Party, and the leading election coalition of businessmen Tegus Tallinn – it seems that the election coalitions created on the initiative of those who have been burned in party politics will participate in local elections this year.
However, the chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
If Edgar Savisaar's supporters have fallen into small size, one can guess the events organized in honour of his election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current Center Party members and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar's loyal supporters and friends evade applying in Tallinn can be found by the fact that the "Savisaar's list" of the makers, led by corruptors and suspects in corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government for a Russian-language pop song involving the elder of the Lasnamäe district; and a rudimentary computer game in all respects, in which the main character Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid puddles and squirrels on the road while riding a bike - will the Center Party try to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to visit the ballot boxes for the first time?
We look forward to the idea of a youthful election campaign by other parties.
If a black square is displayed to the viewer of Kanal 2 or TV3 from the beginning of August instead of an entertainment show, there are two options: to accept that in the future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels will be seen in free-rowing, or to give a ten-year to a TV operator every month.
There are probably also those who are openly happy about the ad-free TV experience at first, but in the end, though reluctantly, pay for TV images and advertisements.
Deafening music, noisy people and trash left in the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the buzz yourself, it's worth going to discover your homeland instead of hurting your head at home - and leave the sleeping place to the festival guests for a hefty amount of money.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump, who said a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said.
Young people from Siberian Seto move to the city, pensioners return to the countryside.
Yevseyev's Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the former River Earth.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a driver in a gold artel on the Maana tributary by the Maana tributary.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without days off, 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years of work at the artel, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There's a hard time: when you go in, you check thoroughly so you don't bring vodka, and when you go out, you don't bring gold," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho is talking to the local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Setos is also beginning to affect home-Setos, because it is just so fabulous, Piho Mare, who studied the distant Setos in most depth, thinks.
30 years have passed since his first research trip to Siberia this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many Setus still migrated to Siberia at the end of the 19th and early 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say 8000.
I calculated it from the stories of the Seto men in Siberia who have thought about it.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given to only one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big the territory was here!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here like peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (rafting logs), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Pechory, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (there the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
They lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marrying each other and having many children was preserved for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did the culture of Siberian Setos differ and differ from that of the Motherland Setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They also made their own (folk clothes), but they always made a difference between what was brought along and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setos and what kind of life is lived there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, it is starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida village at the beginning of July for the Seto Kingdom Day and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It's super easy to come to Tapa and also leave, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural venues, and you can get pizza on every corner.
Tapa is a top city!
There is a small island by the Valgejõgi River, where the slaughterers tend to have a Midsummer Eve party.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window," Reigo muzzles.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the edge of the river, you can have a picnic and just make romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in advance and back.
I've been there with my girlfriends, too.
Opera soloist Tamm has been practicing his arias between three bridges on the riverbank: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one may ever meet if I hum my own stories."
"Männikumäe offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and play disc golf now - the golf course is done, discs can be rented from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't been there yet to play.
I will probably have to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
He'll lend me!
Reigo and Mannikumägi were inseparable from the time of the current opera soloist's childhood.
At least during skiing hours.
There are many tears, disappointments and wins left on this mountain in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is currently full of construction work, all this will change beyond recognition," says Reigo.
The old and tired station building in Tapa, however, is a very attractive place to play summer performances.
I am glad that in 2012 Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.A.M, accepted my idea and came to the station to make summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" was just over, on August 11 there will be "Resurrection" at the railway station, when the old station building will move around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the Tapa City Days will be held, during which the open home cafés of the station building have awakened and a number of cultural events will take place, including a folk rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
The small yellow cabin on May 1 on boulevard has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a huge amount of information," Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and the military.
Reigo smiles that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, you will get hungry in the long run, but luckily the small town is full of cafés.
"We have such good places to eat and when you sit in cafes, you sometimes feel like you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but there is such an international group all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV quoted the foreign ministry as saying two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
Police arrested a group of illegally camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught vacationing in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves who teach puppies are going to break sheep.
After a year's break, Hiiumaa farmers will have to give the wolves "educational material" from their herds again - probably the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have killed sheep in Hiiu County three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, the year before, 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency that no wolf litters were born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year are also in sync with the fractures.
On Monday night, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emmaste and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves broke a sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and seriously injured another, who had to be subjected to an emergency killing.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Release into Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the approval round.
The amendment to the Act will abandon the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and handlers, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are currently not grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-modified crops.
At least until it has been decided to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens related to both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The Bill repeals the provisions of the GMOVS related to the database of GM crop locations and handlers and training on handling, and establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
In the case of aerician, the current obligation of a GM crop grower to inform beekeepers of the initiation of cultivation of a GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The draft Act has been sent to ministries for approval.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the information system of drafts and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect persons, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board operating in the field of crop production.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - MON 810 maize.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing a GM crop.
The reason for this is that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European stemweed with a maize line MON 810 resistant.
Also, the varieties of this cornline are bred for the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain the above, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible pollution with GM organisms in the seeds of various spring rape, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of rape, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are not deliberately grown in Estonia and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic after midfielder Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
The player, who was bought over 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started a 2-1 victory in the starting line-up in Dublin in the final game of the United before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive trips.
But having been sidelined from the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matic was in desperate need of a match uniform and only lasted 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved before the Premier League starts.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We will help him achieve form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, started in the starting line-up at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho slowly began to put his start-up man in place by the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done "excellent work" by signing contracts with three of his four priority options.
“I’m grateful to the club for being able to make three out of four,” he said.
“I will be happier if they can make four out of four, but they have worked hard for me.”
Another crane cub received a GSM transmitter on the leg on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher living in Sõrve, the first storkling was sent by Sõrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Suurlah.
This is because there are no grain fields in Sõrve, writes the Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the cranes, another stool chick was caught on the escort on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a storkling son named Mati GSM-sender was supplied to Sõrves Türju.
"His activities are all available on the Internet: how he went to Spain to winter, when he came back for a long time on the German-Polish border and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could just open his front with a hand sign, get into the office and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and index finger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq also to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anaestesiologist at the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to perform the procedure.
The Northam company will also replace the locks in the houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, charging 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to launch a naval helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as 24 000 dollars in the southern yard for an event celebrating American production.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, called the Marine One while the president was on board, was the central attraction of the event introducing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior officials from the White House explored industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Cabinet demanded a partial order with the helicopter's presence, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it's an unusually high-focused event," the HMX-1 commander told his boss, deputy chief of the Navy's officer in the field of aviation, the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern yard on the morning of July 17 at around 15 a.m. for an event starting at 5 p.m. and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 18 and 21 on the same evening.
The fact was added that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter at the time of the event, and the security team of the squadron remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the magazine TIME whether the second crew was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this setting.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to violate," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the deputy of the chief officer.
The White House declared the event "American-made" official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health care reform that was discussed in the Senate at the time at the event and praised the efforts to keep the government's regulations under control.
Using an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump came under scrutiny in February when his first campaign in Melbourne, Florida, was backing a presidential plane, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the "American-made" display, where products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers from American materials were represented," said acting White House spokesman Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often perform test flights around Washington and in the southern yard to practice putting down the U.S. president at the White House with an accuracy of a centimeter.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 held 58 trial landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight to the "American-made" flight crew was included in the norm for the flight flight that month.
Squadron helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidental support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organization of the display in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget documents for the president's flights, and the exact costs due to the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per hour of flight.
The squadron documents marked the length of the flight from its main base at the Navy's Quantico Airport from Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is far below this amount.
"Calculating the costs of taxpayers based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible expenditure that will be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND survey, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they do cover the costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So, of course, it’s right to highlight it.”
It's unclear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter while taking a tour of the South's courtyard, but he was behind the wheel of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump turned to representatives of Sikorsky, making fun of media outlets about the company's products in his personal fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - peace and joy arrived through tears
At the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, Šadeko was hit by a leg cramp in the last area, in the 800 m run, and the girl was taken away from the stadium by stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had received zero in the long jump at the Universal in China.
The 2012 European Championships in Helsinki were ruined by a cheap throw, but at the London Debut Olympics, he finished in 23rd place with 6013 points.
The misfortune, however, continued.
At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, an Estonian woman who was on the Estonian record chart suffered a dwarf injury after the opening day.
Two years later, he finished 15th in the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic standard, but this, too, had wanted more to disappoint the athlete.
Šadeiko passed the hardest gauntlet only last year, when he did not get a result at the Amsterdam European Championships in the long jump.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-competition once.
Once, confessed Šadeiko.
A month later, his Olympics in Rio were interrupted by a thigh injury at the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken down - will we continue with the seven-race at all?
Is two days of effort worth it?
She thought long, but found peace in herself.
I could think my head clean
It's pretty hard to describe this experience, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," Šadeiko says of his self-cleansing.
I was able to turn the clean sheet and move on with a new momentum.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but he realized that, above all, the athlete had to find out for himself.
He was so smashed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit, however, said he wouldn't give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he deserves," says Mägi.
Now there's some peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-competition.
In a high-level race, he improved his personal top mark by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a record time in the hurdles.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities at all, but only the initial starvation of the competition was erased.
Mägi, who has been supervising him for years, says that Šadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to train.
If something hurts or is wrong, he will say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his own feeling.
That is what we have to proceed from.
I can't say what exactly I have to do and we'll follow it.
Šadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the most of training," he says, saying that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby luck makes close babies happy
Shadeiko has also been given good emotions by the happiness of the loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and several competitors have received support from new world citizens.
"It's been quite interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol, drinking equivalent to "training" the brain.
Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train your brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather in the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing a glass, swirling wine in our mouths, enjoying it and perceiving it with an aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules don't actually contain flavor, but the taste comes from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a wine taster," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the origin of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not to get drunk.
"There has to be more in action," he says.
If you take too much of a sip, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can do harm to the brain instead of benefiting - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, with memory loss, losing balance and reduced mental capacity risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector get paid less than their colleagues
Data from the recruitment company Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, the portal Genius writes.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontes ICT sector wage survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were surveyed.
63% of the posts were occupied by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies think that there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar jobs, the basic monthly salary of men is on average 10% higher than that of women and the total annual salary of men is 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar Põhjala, an analyst at Fontes.
"Narcos" Season 3 Ad Clip: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali Cartel will be at the centre of the Netflix hit series
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of "Narcos", the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already received an advertising clip that teases the series with new villains.
In the third season, the DEA pays attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like the Fortune 500 company", just with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) in this brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leads the ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a freshly released commercial, Pedro Pascal sees Javier Penana return, as a figure recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will kick off on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
UN senior mission leader Nicholas Haysom said hundreds of women are running for local council election, three women running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will be held on 5 April.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advising.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly handed over from a democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women is increased by the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more awesome for both big and small.
There is always too little time together, but exercise with toddlers provides a good opportunity to combine togetherness, play, closeness and load.
And whatever convenient solution you cruise to in the summer, you always have your living dumbbells with you and remind you with your thin voice: "Let's work out now!"
Start with a warm-up - it is very good to play a regular hawk or run along the beach strip.
The squat is the mainstay of staying in the form of the legs and buttocks - who would want to take the shape of a sandcake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use a lever instead of children!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced can also do squats with pretty big children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions and enjoys the opportunity to dangle high and be important.
At the same time, older children can do squats themselves.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the earth and stretching your arms up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini assistant to hold properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super-useful, but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game-plank: take a long plank column to take turns to crawl through.
Actually, harder than usual, but much more fun than giving a friend a hand.
To add a load, you can stay in the plank, the little one on your back, and also walk around in this position.
For extra weight, a small child can be seated on the hips, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While crabs are squealing on the sand, the triceps, buttocks and abdominal muscles receive a load like a naxt.
The child descends to his feet in such a way that his body weight is equally distributed forward and backward.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and straighten up.
The toddler can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss at every time he comes up.
Extra load is given by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back stays in a neutral position.
It is much more fun for children themselves to make abdominal muscles in pairs and with a clap.
Squat with handiwork and pulse.
Monitor the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For the parent, however, a truly effective full-body workout.
Sports equipment was Ott (10), Säde (8), Õnne (4).
From the Philippines to the wide world, or the straw bag trip to the hearts of fashion fans
Straw-braided bags are a summer classic that has become a hit product in its own right in recent years, which has to hang on the end of a real summer enthusiast and to which merchants have been able to weld an additional price tag suitable for the hit, despite its modest origin.
A straw-braided bag is probably one of those things that has ever existed once in a lifetime and that has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have exchanged their fine designer bags for the summer months for simple straw-braided bags.
At the same time, it is not only a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and braver women even walk to the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth making it clear whether the boss is still sitting on such a summer look or whether it is still worth pushing the notebook and laptop to a slightly more official sumada.
However, variety has made straw bags a true summer love of women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that catches your eye is that fashion gourmets rush to the local market first on a holiday trip and buy themselves a straw bag, to which they are faithful throughout their vacation and which goes with them on the beach, in the market and also when hanging out with their girlfriends on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a bigger pile of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand for bags is so great among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go to work with each other by hand to become the happy owner of some bags.
In a way, such madness is also understandable, because it is rare that in the fashion world it is possible to buy a thing that has risen to the status of a hit for only a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to earn money here, and so finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably, so that richer customers wouldn't have to feel like mere mortals who promenade around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a straw bag that costs more than a thousand euros in Dolce & Gabbana.
However, the interpretation of the Chanel straw bag can be spent around 6000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, straw bags do not come from some great fashion mecca, but their story started much further away.
The straw bags are said to have originated in the far Philippines, where they have been carried around.
Braiding a bag from straw is primarily an export business there, and you don't see the locals walking around with them very often.
The straw weaving technique is said to have dated back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket weaving.
However, since the straw bag does not have to be weaved as tightly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded in them, which make the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, there have been trendy bags with colored ribbons or leather strips that have been braided in.
However, straw bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided straw bag fan before.
Namely, he matched the straw bag to all kinds of clothing sets and didn't even think it was much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the fact that taking care of them is a rooster head does not play a minor role in the popularity of bags today, and unlike all other sumadans, they do not need to be taken care of with special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As with trending, in addition to the classic look, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a straw-braided cloth or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but the straw bag does.
But what is a classic straw bag?
For centuries, a straw-braided bag that resembles a basket in style, is open on top and has short, as well as straw, handles.

A man missing in Saaremaa three days ago was found
Aare left his home in the small town of Kärla on Wednesday night in an unknown direction.
The last contact with the treasure was by phone yesterday, Friday evening, and the positioning of the phone gave the man the location of the man in Lääne-Saare rural municipality, the village of Mõnnuste, where he was searched by helicopter until midnight and with the dogs until early morning.
His phone was then drained and his whereabouts could therefore no longer be determined.
The police continued their search this morning.
Police would like to thank everyone who helped find the treasure.
GMB worries about investments in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The union expects the managers of the cookie producer McVitie to confirm the long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross object.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the site over the past few years.
They hired more workers and trade union chairmen "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's company with a request "to dissect concerns about the fact that the funding is not used to modernize production lines."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are not clearing out from the head of the site about the business needs of Tollcross and the investment plan for the future is a matter of deep concern for our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being an indispensable pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So Glasgow, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and against the background of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, urgently needs a company with a strong return at McVitie."
A spokesman for Pladis said: "The Tollcross site manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to him, as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between employees and GMB representatives, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross site, most of it has gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the activity of the object, the workers and the representatives of the trade union will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in an effort to lure Neymar into his ranks, making an offer of 189 million pounds to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This swingy approach has opened a summer transfer window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the world record for overbought, which was set last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than 500 000 pounds a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona are known to be angry about both the approach and breaking Neymar free, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the world of football about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser warned Al-Khelaif harshly all clubs who are thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will confront them and contact their players,” he said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this border as the Spanish club previously showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of their precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brex is seriously threatening to wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible to make the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and since this cannot be done, he would remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have such a deal with Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs offices that would proclaim historic splitting and political failure.
"A break to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland while visiting Belfast.
Märt Avandi: Everyone can complete their first half-long triathlon: Ironman.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in Otepää, when approximately a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries took place in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also triumphantly finished his first triathlon.
"I thought it would be difficult and in the end it was difficult," Avandi said at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that triathlon is actually feasible for almost everyone.
"It's not distance that kills, it's the pace that kills," he said, suggesting that almost everyone will reach the finish line at an affordable pace.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Ott's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been training vigorously since February.
At first, 4-5 hours a week, but later ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12 he finished in 270th place overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was the "person of a good example" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Oak in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
The overall winner of the men's competition in the Otepää stage of the Ironman series was German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
Among women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while Estonians Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi completed a 1.9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410.
