The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative slump.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions of CEZ shares reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the start of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed since the collapse of the day before it was almost at 6 per cent.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, too, we show a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan for stabilizing the local financial sector.
Collapse of stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, Asian stock exchange shares experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, cancelled a portion of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index cancelled nearly 4 percent during the day, but later also a portion of the losses stabilizing at 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5 percent, but in the end the losses settled at 4.3 percent.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell 3.6 percent.
"The planning of rescue action is uncertain and that will affect financial markets around the world," Hong Kong Currency Office chief Joseph Yam noted.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, thus without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer from the consequences.
American Stocks Massacre
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system’s support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech crowns) were to be allocated.
Lawmakers have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
American stocks Monday experienced a massacre and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest crash in over twenty years.
The Dow Jones index dropped nearly 7 percent and a collapse of similar size was last observed in 1987.
The index was already lowering before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has succumbed: the U.S. government can give 700 billion dollars to the banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be early next week.
American lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout in the form of economic aid for the American financial system totaling 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion kronor).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting for it.
The financial system's support plan will be discussed Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday he told Reuters, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the approval of the financial plan should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Subsequently, however, we will have the return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to achieve the help of the markets.
Paulson: the Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
“We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package,” said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Delegates of lawmakers gathered the night between Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should serve to acquire from financial companies non-failing mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
"We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market."
“We need to carry out the recovery plan again, but I think we’re here,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls strongly on the stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trade on the Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence Monday's market following Congress's decision.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and although negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount provided for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overwhelm its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. getting the finances to buy passive mortgage values, the price of which has plummeted due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We have worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
American President Bush is also satisfied with progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's positive performance and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve taken a big step towards the deal that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans as well,” said Paulson.
The plan counts on helping homeowners who have problems on payments.
The government is expected to negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on installments for debtors and allowing it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought
This will be crucial for how the losses between them are divided by the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan is approved now or early next week it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, is that already this week the representatives of the congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they beat it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important time, "Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties, led, according to the first provisional results, to Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for the triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the vote, but compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5%.
Even worse went for ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in post-war Austrian history and especially the literally catastrophic result of the popular, who provoked early elections.
Still in early July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in the front of SPÖ in the preferences.
But the voters evidently punished them because they sank the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there have been speculation about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe they could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path to the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties (FPÖ), they gained 18% and BZÖ 11% in advance, but the socio-democratics simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people of the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even a reason for sanctions by the Union
On this evolution evidently plays Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter Parliament, but it fell slightly, descending among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has evidently crossed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Duel to the death: MP3 players against mobiles
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why to get an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from the qualitative point of view for this reason there is not even an objective reason.
But if you crowd hard-rock vinyls, jazz or blues on your shelves, you probably dream of a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digesting the market's twenty-wreath headphones.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The duration of the batteries is decided.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply read music, but which mobile phones don’t do by mistake either.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Alongside the primary functions, calling and texting, can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe can even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, and the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobiles can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, do not count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add to it, from time to time, some call, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasting at a minimum of 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem exists when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to make it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobiles.
Readers, except for a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a media library sorted by the names of the interpreters, album name, genre, or by user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are particularly interested in battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If you need music especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need any mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is now successful, clearly at any mobile phone.
You don’t have to deal too much with what formats your mobile phone or reader recognize.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of the devices support music in WMA format.
There is less the AAC (a format used by the company Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobiles also allow you to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service already could be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and is usually limited to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (be it via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their phones.
Anyone who wants to listen to something rummages in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always carry the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheaper ones normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best mobile phones and from the technical point of view more equipped and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) can really make anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of maneuverability once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally impacting the start-up of the mobile internet and consequently a giant data transmission bill.
What device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (M2 type, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which have been included in the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can also do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you also want to buy yourself an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners, preferably take the specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this context, Sony Ericsson has made more progress, which walkman line mobiles have the same scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands ensure the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that obliges traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missed for a long time.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, ČTÚ also confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regularisation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that would really start the clash.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100 %.
Instead, mobile telophony operators like to whine about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, also often emphasizes, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities. (It would be difficult to find other frequencies.)
But there is yet another possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators has brought a considerable lowering of prices, to which traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, similar voices as similar as we did in Britain resounded.
However, it has been shown that the place for operators like this is there and that they can be truly successful.
After all, we don't have to go very far for example.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs among other things U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete group-target.
In order to actually work, it is enough for many fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually show up at low cost, offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
So for example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-target not small.
This operator points specifically to men.
“Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, which manufactures this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also say a similar concept in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no chance, say the operators of the mobile network
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have much expectation.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thinking.
Rather, on the contrary, they try to do everything because you do not create any potential competitor.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in the launch of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner you do the better.
We have negotiated repeatedly on this possibility with all Czech operators in the mobile network.
We have already managed to progress in negotiations with some of them," says Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
The unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will have to have it perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, around his creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
“Right now we don’t believe that in the Czech market there is space for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the Telefònika O2 press section.
Other operators also use the specific nature of the Czech market.
T-Mobil's press spokesman Martina Kemrová added in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both of you, on which it is possible to continue building."
He adds: "In the T-Mobil network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we will have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather than reaching its 3G license requests.
Adds Miroslav Čepický : "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this is especially the case in the field of sharing expenses and infrastructure.
Let’s consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
The competent authorities -with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby to the decrease in profit.
Why facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the U:fon creation testify that when operators care about one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against ČTÚ in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidence of public access information from ČTÚ's web pages.
But now just U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The environment of competition from the mobile phone market has been little done enhanced beyond everything with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place on him and especially on his high-pretension services.
However, the attitude of mobile operators is surprising the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ that unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Great Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, against the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between mobile operator and virtual operator was implemented.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the ÚOHS External Relations Section, in the answer to our question.
Such a worded statement from the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead, on the part of the office that must defend the interest of consumers and also take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, arises on its own.
Likewise, the exact price of petrol for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behavior about this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so he does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for his behaviour in the market.
The tools needed for the opening of the mobile network market for virtual operators are perhaps also lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points .
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach – the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the day logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we don't admit this argument, for ÚOHS it should be at least allerting that three mobile operators proceed so strangely similarly.
At the same time, complaints from those concerned (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Unloading responsibility in ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS keeps itself out of the whole matter.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has failed to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the recently passed telecommunications law, despite the fact that, many experts expected the improvement of the situation.
This fact ÚOHS representatives need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done when no one is looking
While without us realizing it, the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators remains, of which there are even some in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile phone services but are only partially public.
Usually it’s about multilevel marketing companies.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company towards the operator figures as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special pricing offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If the cases you talk about, of which we will be interested, we could deal with a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied to the question in question.
But it is somewhat unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of the subjects responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies, that is, they make a significant profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, therefore they cannot fully dispose of it as the regular customers of mobile operators "
But this should be a strange minimum at ČTÚ.
Plus another issue opens up for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes in front of such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not expensive
As in the text has already been said several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a significant lowering of prices for services.
At the same time in virtually all the countries where the operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - market too small, to the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in these cases, regulatory bodies have intervened in these cases in defense not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then we came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies launch themselves from one to the other all the case as a hot potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator will really soon appear with us, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only it could hardly ÚOHS remain unfazed by the refusal (discrimination) of the other data subjects.
And maybe we'll stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with the male or female voice, chorus step and the instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem reviews are Otakar Jeremiáš and Yaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the solo variations, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the choir, have the clear diction, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony" he reported.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He gained popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslavakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
Wednesday MHD Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pocket will go up in the metro, tramway and bus.
At this time they can get it about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual one (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada,
The coupons can be bought as early as yesterday on the internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget the counters in the metro stops where so far they had to make long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon is bought via the internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained staff who will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also register on their card the credit acquired." said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to load electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the subway entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly metro stops, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the whole city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrný said.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will run from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and after payment of the coupon, it will load above.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transports of Prague there are the controllers equipped with card readers with whom they verify the time and zonal validity," explained the Filip ticket control mode by the Ropid organization, which fine-tunes the schedules of collective transport in Prague.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s cash register.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition you have to place the Opencard at the point determined next to the checkout.
So the driver verifies the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and do not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where they load the coupons on the card.
Here you will see the information on the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Germans of the Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the Sudetenland in 1945 asked to include Šumava to the United States.
This is reflected in the letter filed in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Germans of the Sudetenland turned in 1945 to the president of the United States.
This is also the result of the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "district of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive at German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter signed with the words "The people who care about the fate of Šumava with all their heart" are written.
Since, they say, annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudetenland hope only to brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to assume the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, at all, to the victory of the Allies," the letter writes.
The reason the perpetrators cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge thirst by the "Czech oppressors."
If the president of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the command of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the then of the Germans of the Sudetens.
Even if the Czech Germans had to guess in the slightest that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility altogether.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to visit him for him to teach him Czech.
"These believed that once they got home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Beneš they would be moved by the Republic.
Don't think -you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so you could call the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to start Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of driving alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before he leaves.
He wants to touch in conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What is it that will appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think -you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is capitally written on the plaque.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment's distraction pay with their life.
The commercials will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
It thus promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and so save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or accident.
We must remember the risk to the drivers, " says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that alert drivers to the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of the danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli interim government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert spoke out for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the Jediot Achronot newspaper.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) areas, if not all, " Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the bulldozers or the esplanators to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, he will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the mention of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also ruled for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, that is, according to him the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
“Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up permanent support, which offer Hamas terrorism, (Shiite movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, it would be according to the Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then it would be, that some cooling would take place," he noted after the meeting that took place under a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said the executive power can hardly meddle inside the legal chores.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the accusation and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučera to be sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself equally during the negotiations.
"It recommends the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain pardons," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter, is to lend the condemned the "competent legal support," the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time he said such support is already lending him the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been passed down for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg declared.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, in front of his partner he pointed out that the Czech Republic gives great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists a deep mistake,” he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got from the Indian side the promise to deal with the thing.
"I got relatively many promises," he only noted.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards in buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the coach of the company Student Agency, the question came out whether stewards and passengers can move aboard the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws severely and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s accident, with which a 22-year-old hostess lost her life, was caused by a truck that cut the way for the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting at that time next to the driver on the least safe place of the bus, although there were still two more seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even when distributing the coffee or newspapers.
Whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the driving booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers must sit.
Student Agency buses have no standing seats, the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed it to the Aktuálnĕ.cz website.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
Afterwards it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the ride if they have the assigned seat," he expressed his view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law is concerned with the regularisation of this role.”
No regulation, however, prohibits the transporter from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic only recognizes the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný instead believes, that the law takes care of this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has the standing seats approved.
That's all," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban where there are standing seats and maximum limited speed, intercity with standing seats with higher maximum speed and long-haul without the standing seats with maximum speed allowed and the seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can hit his head.”
"If the bus makes a sharp brake, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Equally as in the urban bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
This takes about two hundred.
The director does not even after the accident consider their job dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling that I have to consider the profession of steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they go up.
They would also decrease expenses," he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in safety.
"We don't have hostesses, we already oppose it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess from the Plzeň region died, who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the coach.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but bumped it with the right front.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two reserved places for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-term coaches, they are unbelievable."
The company plans to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results though.
They don’t consider them as much as buses, they deal more with the system with score, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving,” says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," with this concludes spokesman Havelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and the adjacent marine zones.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 NOS Division workers for issues on the oceans and maritime rights.
Its boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adding something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral matters, but also unknown living organisms so far that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the state coast in question.
That has according to the convention an exclusive right over all resources of the continental shelf.
"In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Committee on the Definition of the Size of the Continental Platform must be accompanied by a very wide technical and scientific documentation based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional aid.
The commission has so far dealt with 5 requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three last nominated have been successful," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has been a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand also gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will yield him in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually present their demands.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioner investor".
He has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Island and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it's a near-submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a deposit rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Division of Macedonia Rober Sandev carries an exhibit to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary schem, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB director addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the savings bank financial group" through the unit meeting of the bank in Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a firm.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive push for further ties in the Länder banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the plagued WestLB is still under intense pressure.
Not only by the EU commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Service, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB certainly have been talked about for quite a while, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the time of the presentation of turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house to via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB does not make sense.
However, the Deka board member, half of whom is brought in by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with the West LB on joint trades.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3000 collaborators is one of those that matter most in the business square in Frankfurt, we do not talk about it the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 for a short time it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Hesse regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always often thought about it for a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba Governing Council, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Put aside this seems to create cognition, that it is necessary for the different public sector houses to approach.
Given that the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first occur.
For Helaba, this is not entirely good news.
If the pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will gradually be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of the Assia-Turingia savings banks that participates with 85 percent of the Helaba, has put the bolt to the meeting with the WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just one account.
On the other hand there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses match.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, by what business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter from the board of directors expresses a willingness to aspire in any case to a "general solution."
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the barrel of 5l. of the brand Kaiser stands a bearded massif and demonstrates to the about 200 travelers what are the deep tones it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking lot next to Porta Nuova station, depart this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Beer Festival ", scheduled arrival at 6.30 a.m.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the car park the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated overnight.
It's so loud, says Marco, that it's not a thing for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with a fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with the silver wide splints belong to him the buses.
For 5 years they have been going to Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
The night, during the day at the party, return at 22.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the disease fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, travelers sleep.
Better this way, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 a.m. at the car park near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group, Marco explains for the last time the attacking program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer marquee it means running!" quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Running!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service that we behave well!
As soon as they leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 22.30 on time we meet again here! Understood?"
We're going to the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow the yellow caps to the trees, the road signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as the "Italians' weekend."
The exact number of data does not exist, we are talking about 50 thousand, which leave to cross the Alps and invade the marquees, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatment in front of the British (about 60 medical treatment) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good for the politician to have used the word "relative" and also told that the German banking sector is not spared critical developments.
Because the crisis started at the weekend.
Real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from the turmoil in the markets.
A person experienced in the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion Euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the required party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The state lender according to a newspaper article has refinanced in a very short term – which is no longer possible due to distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank's reserves had reduced by 95% to 2.37 million Euros, even the share of equity sold from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current incomes and net annuities from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared last year, earnings from increases both in demand and certain shares as to the liquidation of provisions in credits have fallen more than 70% to 5 million Euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost to speculation with commercial real estate claims, which were broken down into the Aareal Bank.
Given that income in classic state funding was too low, Depfa engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the uptake of Depfa is a major lender of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of credits among banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires for a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a time and the company protected from the influence of international money markets mostly not functioning.
From other sources you can hear, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
HRE Steering Committee Chairman Georg Funke said that the HRE Group will not need money markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still insured.
This is hoped for the bank's equities and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the financing is not used completely.
But even the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After the bank was about to fail on Sunday night, the temporary bailout failed to calm the mood.
The share course falls by 75% to 3.30 Euros.
Mortgage courses hold up quite well.
While front-grade debts show themselves to be almost immovable, they give up the courses of postered credits.
The mortgages of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo are mainly affected, the start-ups with a maturity of more than 2009.
Before the mortgages of the HRE seemed a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institute itself, which with the relief of the Depfa has etched the crisis, will have to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an amortization of annualities within the deadline.
Or it goes into operation, what no one dares to hope for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But regarding the information overturned due to partial statizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors can complete the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains countervailance tax.
German special units were present at the hostages' release
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 kidnapped European hostages we receive more and more detailed information.
On the rescue operation, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior mentioned, German Special Units participated.
In addition to the specialists of the army were present on the spot the units GSG9, the avian federal police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistic experts of the technical institution.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday night, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there thankfully," an interior ministry spokesman says.
Attackers kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the abduction in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or the possible ransom payments.
The freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It was not explained about the details of the release.
There had been no information in Berlin, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper the 5 holidaymakers and special units are expected to leave in flight with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to giggle: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
First day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had fifa to go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to the Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road myself and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 a.m. onwards, until 8.40 a short interview with the professor, the so-called "home room" begins.
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who speaks willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I posed in front of the chair and I tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy to have already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, chuckled and made a sign and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet."
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to a student of exchange
The rest of the class hour had continued quietly, but when she played the gong, I was assailed in the true sense of the word.
Everything spoke disorderly and giggled and dried me up with questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also gave me the basket for the Lunch- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu ..
Actually, I don't even know what exactly I eat in Japan.
Things look weird and taste entirely new.
Fact is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put in salt, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to make the boy's acquaintance during the recess.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" asked my friends when I told me, that I wanted to go for a year to school in Japan.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I have been reading Mangas with fervor for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn the Japanese language a bit.
I was completely convinced to come there once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends – on the opposite side: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have never seen in my life.”
American House of Representative rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American congress has just failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 rumors around 227 the American representative house rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite appeals from American President George W. Bush and prominent politicians from both parties had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets would have to be curbed.
In a dramatic action the supporters tried desperately, to persuade critics from the heavy pack of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited the congressmen to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While suffrage was underway the Dow Jones plunged more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapse again.
Experts now expect more serious turmoil in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must be welcomed by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or cockroach flees when they feel the danger. Does that mean, that they also feel fear?
Neurologist scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it occur if, when they behave in the same way, they have the same feelings as us?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years are published articles by well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers chosen to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or someone else so far having been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impractical territory, because the baseline does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feeling to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large zone is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should arise in the way of speaking of man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said that it is related to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would affect it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
For this reason, it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but other than that there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to have access to.
We could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, we first move on to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
So what is outlined for feelings?
I blame them for the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies working memory.
Given the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and paleo cephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and humans appears to be fear, is probably felt with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and human beings feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach in case of danger flee as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephals, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be shown for human beings: how is it that you would like to prove it on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there are neural progress here, as long as it renounces the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly slamming a wall.
I'm a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries
Both host countries limp in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
If necessary, the number of stadiums to be used for the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with the maximum speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigoriy Surkis.
"UEFA will be constantly watching us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of operating under the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA president Michel Platini that preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Numerous members of the first division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end it was even due to postpone the beginning of the League at the last moment.
Promoters record increasing figures of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year increased evidently - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of the economy, the desire to travel of the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 % turnover plus compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are booking fees increased even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October in comparison with 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, the DRV said.
The assumptions for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and draws up statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would also be included.
Because of the weak price of the dollar, particularly required would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Travel destinations would also be particularly in demand among the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive travel has a high quotation, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would be a surplus of turnover again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year fell.
Dennis Quaid retorts outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in interview he talked about the private and now has great with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his ex Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams with anger and retorts.
Red War delayed for former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now dispute with each other a bad quarrel - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this was very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would only come to know after the separation.
The occasion for the "strip of the soul" was the work with the press of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was of clear blurtout: it would be "unheard of," the fifty-four-year-old told the "New York Daily News," that "Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship."
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "are publicly remembered the pain and subversion, that a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives on her own, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that everything goes well to."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of the year 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel overnight stays have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by financial provider and travel American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 up to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak price of the dollar, which would have led to a "waning desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still marks up:
Due to the increase in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel intensive flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the economy class’s airline ticket prices dropped by an average of 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business, however, price changes were far weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11,9 %, falling by 23,6 % in the second quarter.
As for internal German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
Reason for the price crash would be on the one hand the downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be due to the agreement on the open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was formulated precisely, he passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the Hamburg arena cabin corridor.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most sat back in place.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades, enjoys an even greater estimate than some old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the upper echelons.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg-based chief coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today here not everything was nice to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted more relaxed."
For the 1 to zero those in Hamburg must thank the header made by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the players many weak of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win," Martin Jol summarized.
Hamburg's SV will turn 121 this Monday.
Viewers celebrated already before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"we can put everything right," Marcell Jansen said.
It has the premonition, that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with his new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the goal defender Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – slowly finds herself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol strongly relaunched.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann's Hits, one-liter mug beer and VIPs in designer Dirndln.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, already the photographers launch themselves against us and take photos until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The cheap Dirndl seems to be achieving its goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and resident actually north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume / dress to date is still within the limits.
And once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange glances at the chocolate banana stand.
A monacense points out to me that I would have fastened the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind the widow."
I sneak up on my bow from behind to left.
It's fine," he says it and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and irons the bare behind against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a trawled "ooooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mug from a liter drunk earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a dustbin.
Bob is one of these infamous Wildbieslers.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m. the sanitary workers walk in a pack on the forecourt of the party, who must take care of the poor beoni
Nurses appear each time in packs – always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered with tent in a tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie under the tarp in this coffin from alcohol in the blood, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the sanitary ware shouts at me and disappears into the shamble.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
Early reports of the bailout package failure temporarily plunged the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in the space of a day in its history.
Later the Down recovered a little again.
Around 20:30 the world's largest stock market barometer listed/recovered with a good 5% in shortage out of 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Stock Exchange was at a standstill with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, it put us back just 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could do it.
Shares in Goldman Sachs have yielded just 10 %.
Just a few days earlier the big investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
The financial funds for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents had to be allocated under the rescue plan
The amount must be paid, however, not at a stroke, but by degrees.
In reference, the state had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate price trend , to reduce the charge for the coffers of the state.
The course of actions in Europe and the USA in the downside
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the US does not erase investor doubts.
The course of the shares of Germany's big bank Hypo Real Estate falls to a peak and tears the German stock exchange's index down
The US Dow Jones index loses despite the planned financial market salvation via the state.
Spectacular loss of the course of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have pulled the index of the German stock exchange in deep deficit.
Shares of Monaco's real estate lender lost despite the federal government's rescue action and private banks temporarily 3-quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank divesting more than 20 percent.
The index of the German DAX stock exchange slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is listed with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
World stock markets fall to their knees.
On New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar bailout package might not be enough to bring the financial markets back to the increase.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3 per cent on 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Deputies wanted to vote on the bailout, the vote in the senate could follow on the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges also could only take one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index gave up 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia the benchmark Nikkei index after initial profits fell by 1.26 % on 11,743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 per cent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex bottom index lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
In the MDax yield Arcandor's shares after the announcement of a capital increase.

The business and tourism group also announced that the stakes on the Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has been creating perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity may be not entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, death by freezing now looms over her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates havoc – the abnormality of the swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the space probes, with which they achieve additional momentum/push/swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical gimmick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What amazes scholars for years: rockets do not behave quite as you would expect according to the law on gravitation.
In fact, we come to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly get faster or slower.
So far physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attractive force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely exact.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and attempts to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only been aware of space for about 10 years.
From her evidently comes a force of attraction, the effect of which on the other celestial bodies is seen.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers turn out to have been killed.
In southern Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom are already ongoing.
The Germans are always in the sights of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was agreed upon by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed
We are looking into their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstory of a shooting that took place before the hostages were still unclear: so the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security agent would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been resolved.
They agreed for a ransom," the official said.
It would have been "still just a matter of taking over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded from Germany a ransom of the amount of 6 million euros; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostage after the payment of the ransom.
The men should have been held back until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused a position on the report.
Victim of an incident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the crash Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly after.
After the incident a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving.
He was released on bail.
Patrigno abuses 'led to suicide'
Years of abuse by the stepfather have led a woman to kill herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in jail for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she was a little girl and living in Coventry, Trerise molested her and blindfolded her before she had sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was plagued by the abuse they had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead," and that she had "dunk with life."
In April 2007 her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by choking on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I would tie her up and blindfold her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harsher is the fact that if he didn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up before the court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie's father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was away from the defence ministry when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the allegations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They will have thought that this was being treated internally to the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies deal with B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of more than £80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money of savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) general manager Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion pounds will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's irritating that those institutions that behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18 percent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC he believes is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home-recovering market are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a meaningful account," Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Turkey is broadening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire slightly decadent building.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the magnitude of the feat of what was the most Western transition.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a laggard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy boundaries of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917, an ammunition train broke out, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disaberagement, largely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this railroad outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-increasing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy boundaries of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the car read for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt run along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a centuries-old state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic root represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more remarkably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by malls built means and pastry shops of power, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Full, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reinstate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point, " I ask, " will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I spoke to here has recited by heart: the ties of not only the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message appears to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those rail lines eastwards across Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe."
Back then, at least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should make claims to this fascinating country.
The milk rises to 5 pennies per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be a wholesale price increase in its milk for an extra five penny per liter from Monday.
It's the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Denied bail to former Bangladeshi Prime Minister
A Bangladeshi court has refused a bail request from previous Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka (729,700 dollars) to a businessman when she was a member of parliament
The case is one of many corruption allegations that hang against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier in the month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, has demanded that the temporary government of the military-backed country give her total freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical attention on parole, it is unclear under the terms of her release, whether she can remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on parole for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
He expects the return home of Sheikh Hasina after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government flanked the military force took power, but was released in June to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunisation campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite promises from the Taliban that they would not attack or thwart thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition's appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9 per cent to less than 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered the competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV sows doubts about ITV's independence, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate particularly - remedy as BSkyB had said it would be surrendered it voting rights.
New investigation into US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticise the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former attorney general Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations concerning potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or ascertained," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been assessed more poorly than so many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against Democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and bring lawsuits to court on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other officials from the justice department were fired.
(The inspector general's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales's role in the case, saying he held a primary responsibility in the dismissals, which he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's previous senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will pick up his special gold prize at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honoured" to earn recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track on the 1977 album hit by Meat Loaf.
Coldplay will conduct nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained nearly nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitus forced him to cancel the concerts.
It emerged later that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossbars, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and residents have long found it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 in length, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy route.
There are no traffic signs.
It is virtually impossible to see her on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner step for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city's department of preservation and development, which has control of the streets, has no interest in holding it.
During a meeting of the committee for the use of the land of the municipal commission of the district some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that it wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean he wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a housing conservation spokesman, said it was the city's wish to sell the road and pointed out that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was splendid," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, have objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, adducing that the piece of public ownership, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually no changed city fragment that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Somewhat Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Speech of the City's History that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dead-end, dark street even by day and bounded doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with gates, with weeks-old newspapers fluttering down the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran nimbly across the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a bottle of 22-ounce empty beer lies near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places. "
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students, "which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are for the majority Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth-grade pupils, a surprising 100 per cent of students took the top-level test in the 2008 math status exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-grade pupils took the expert level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama's preferred one.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuse" type.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we had fantastic success with a student just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to pinpoint what it was."
"It works," he noted, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools with a majority Hispanic and with English students?
The achievements of the school make the answer to that question very easy, but educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own ongoing support for bilingual education prevent it from predicting Mr.'s response. Obama.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to be sure that your children are capable of speaking Spanish."
If Obama really wishes to close these gain gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to 99.80 dollars a barrel at New York's merchant stock exchange in morning operations.
Prices have lost more than 20 dollars a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial agitation, and by pairs of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at 145.26 dollars a barrel in June, prices had plunged to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders had said they reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from having passed.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the weekend's frantic negotiations had led to a bailout deal "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter scores a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets' uniform in the past eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfolding on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equaled the greyness of the threatening clouds that overpowered them with a sluggish game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tuning made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path" said Favre of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing takeout, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner heavily.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The latest turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a goal from 20 yards, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I really liked the second quarter more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Rested Gebrselassie surpasses her world record
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie showed again because many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory over the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shatters his previous score of 2:03:26 for 27 seconds, run last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such a stunning career that he produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a burning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-crossers such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the decades passed, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had cramping in her calves and missed a week of training.
Clearly, rest left him cool, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on the opener as if it were a middle-country race, and setting world records over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in the competition after the openers vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is being described as a bad accident, but she healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great gap, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Tucked away in the theme park extended on Orlando's suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas, two schools and no prisons."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city he described - and that makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
She is as independent, dignified and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what you're missing."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called in for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very cautious about how our story is being told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It's a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the southern blacks' rural culture - sometimes disdainful, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for the picture of Eatonville really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario from black history and human drama
As low as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Off the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he might just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora used to say it what it was like," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston captures citing men singing gross songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family who moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston swooped into the city, he routinely arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were grinning.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, swinging in his chair on the back-and-back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely christened, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaqueless grave at Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand her contribution to the world or her legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 80's.
The Orange County officers wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 across the western city limit.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had given an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the door of the community.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people who sat on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a watermelon from a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you would hug your teacher in the morning, hug your teacher in the evening," N said. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - a black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began a long way to the Hurston's unplated grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, a blatant biography of Robert E's Hurston. Hemenway hit the shelves of bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had swept through the limelight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began to design in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the street.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway, brought what you would say high speed, a real pride for the city," Ms. said. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd puts it more simplely: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Those from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the historical public register in 1998.
A new single-story bookcase (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from downtown Orlando, can give the feeling of a side street in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's at 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the story of Eatonville, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A permit asked in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - they are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a plump teacher, with a soft spot for bright red, still fears their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"A lot of people, if they've just come in here, they're going to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to everyone else,'" said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's truly a pretty city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn't notice that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass, honeycomb offices over their heads are the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "bad day in the office" every day since the 1929 crash.
The deliverymen shake metal carts for the tea through the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for meetings for breakfast.
Latin Americans drag their feet between apartment buildings leading, like human mules, 50 and broken ironed shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel to food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a business day.
There didn't seem to be a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's counter, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service counter, where old customers order cheque booklets, tourists ask for directions for the department store Macy and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "trusted banker," they were lining up for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from the places from which commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past years, 15 of those banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days the Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in assets, has been subjugated to the receivership, and, while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of 440 billion dollars, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who were in front of me, afraid for another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is demanding more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went banking, and her emaciated general manager Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge, almost fifty-year-old from my apartment building, changed the subject with respect to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my shopping.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risk."
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 9/11) had in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/ under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty-somethings - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to deal with everything that music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself."
He had said: "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial nor flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, it was increasingly rising.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint knight a conductor it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his own words, simply "rode around the world one or two well-known workhorses."
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your William Woodruff obituary (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD."
This follows from the Woodruff author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the U.S. as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
Profaned Muslim graves as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a rally to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like the road ones representing mosques with a red line passing through the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by a hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is related in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which happened towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a spiritual research journey following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehement anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were called by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party that won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that change was brought predominantly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad banned to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous star of rock guilty of child sexual abuse, was banned from travelling to France and Spain by the court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed authorities that they controlled him of wanting to go to Spain via France.
The ban on foreign travel was granted to Kent police last Thursday after he provided the magistrates with evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's preture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford court, Kent Police filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's overseas trip to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of sex offenders.
He must give notice to the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our perspective, it's easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the behaviour of those convicted of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When he came Glitter flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have him passed to the passport check and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge, west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by travelling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor dresses from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, seizing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and of capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inward.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco greats with the camera.
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a slab camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of flamenco proper to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dancing, the singing or the playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about seventy artists portrayed.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits on display at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, be this a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare yourself with people, characters that sometimes you don’t even know or that only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," so he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend” filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer was faced with an audience to which time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined way" to make up for the "lack of work"and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa pointed out, arguing that, on the contrary, it "has effects" and that it "makes people more nonconformist." For this reason he invited the writers to "not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for their own vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The celebration of the bullfights that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the conditions of the ground of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of bullfighting.
The weather has been against this Festival preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfighting.
Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista were on the billboard, who were supposed to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival only had regular unfolding on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being taken out in triumph, after having bulled with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than thanks to the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing by the Los Llanos arena without glory and without penalty.
With the second bull, after a tremendous forklife, he earned the whistles of much of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Officers intimate the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping give themselves to the escape.
Officers intimated the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
Officers after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal constituency of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, accelerated sharply and passed the checkpoint.
Officers turned themselves in pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometres, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
The officers of the Ertzaintza then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
The hashish breads, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since officials ascertained that the freshman had been "duplicated" since it did not coincide with the one reported in the documentation of the van, the arrestee was also accused of the crime of falsification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the provenance of the drugs seized.
Inmate A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under drug effect
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the Californian road.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "crushed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth. Turning down, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who at first glance, apparently, had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the officers took her to a specialist drug and alcohol use center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved to be cooperative and the alcohol excess hypothesis was discarded from the beginning, although "according to the officers at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear had left a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general of the UI and member of the party Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of cronyism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been the councillor in the Sevilian council to date.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva allegedly committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
Similarly he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public office."
"Sangre de mayo," Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director attempted to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have made with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2. The director had agreed as long as the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the proper scenery and customs to portray a "stunned Spain that misjudged the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" noted Garci.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantastos de Goya - more than double compared to Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes planned by the set design that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver in empezar, has influenced what is his practice of habitual work, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the industry in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom fall into the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Oscar nominee four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos -, do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect awards.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to simply shoot an extra film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer pays tribute to another equally Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's empowerment, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have loved to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible to me."
She supports the dancer: "we do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
Thus, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of her shows, as she does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I'm happy because he's agreed to work in my work and I feel very honoured to that."
The set-up also includes the musical and guitar composition such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have always been well-rounded, and who have always had many
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that era, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, habitually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and even less considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I would like to review José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They caught my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
With the publication of the "Diary of a poet recién casado" the Three-year period also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Poet Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Councillor for Culture of the Council of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Prize
Thus, the "Three-Year of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, will be expected to arrive
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Council of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poet Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest value Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I've now lost a great friend," mourned Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overdoing it.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtues and remain well people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and defeated causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn dead overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost much to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring about either nationality or passports.
The latest James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that no man died, an era ended.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and having a serious and distant private life on cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while certainly not missing the opportunities for not being so.
"Why do I go out of hamburgers today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was so proud of that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were later taken into account when evaluating and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the withdrawal of the ridge, which assumed that you would go first.
It didn't seem like a wrong idea, but if they force you to go, that's to collect everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
But no.
You had to go just to take the backbone (first nonsense, go just for it) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only 'S' size T-shirts (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are trifles compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, what's more, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which was incomprehensible for a race that more than 11,000 people expect.
So, as was to be expected, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the feat, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait for more than 40 minutes, to which attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in correct order because of the chip that, I suppose did not record the arrival properly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not fit into my thoughts.
So I think we're going to keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their location in the company - and to listen and understand keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group with whom he is talking and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be available to her shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential and less loaded functions of commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it's going to be "the least."
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
He performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take your computer to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time surfing the network than in a remote window environment.
What is half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 needs to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to be a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring back here a small example.
I took the photograph in this post at one of Microsoft's employee recreation venues, in Redmond, earlier this month.
On the soft drink machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future.”
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform a search on the network.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forzuto with the pointed mustache that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's T-shirt, with the interior of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt bring as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And beware, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marinara T-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Undergarments designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
Second assault on Honda supersales
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to everything is a refined mechanic, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger size and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyzing the new model, it is useful to point out that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less well known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
That's exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also in the course of this 2008.
Nearly one million units of the Jazz have been sold in Japan since launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes the new Jazz will allow sales to be increased in the segment.
So, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates hover around 100,000 passenger cars, assuming a sales increase of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .to reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company's managers plan to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do that, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
It's Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first few months of the year, immediately after the presentation in the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width of the 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase the 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the inclusion of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters plus the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measures of the 1.4 motor version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4-liter petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keep the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-liter model allows you to take advantage of a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horsepower in the first generation model, 100 are now available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their own name.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, he conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish home?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50's and 60's, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and observing how women dress, how they combine and mix their own clothes. I do that frequently.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, although in the end, everything flows and there are many elements in common.
I, since I was a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rummage through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better even than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
You know that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the moment you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
But no.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted since I was a child and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mother, or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me and also I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with much love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for some films to be released in different cinemas last year.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and restless, I would like everything right away and in a clear way, but it can't always be so.
I want "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let's see if you like them
You debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell a few days ago, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to attend a charity show for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we exhibited - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I know her long time can confirm that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part that you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help third world women, you can't back down.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an expansion of the four-area Safety Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, the engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately, allows to prevent collision.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, and not even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not taking advantage of infinite directions and ways like bees do.
For this reason, the Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of the previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, or even mega."
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to their destination avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Alcoholic relapsed drivers will have to install the "alcohock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in its car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle while intoxicated or if it does not blow into the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
This initiative, in addition to the Attorney General for Road Safety, will be attended by the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Sicurezza dell'Automobile (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving then return to drive the car.
Alcohol would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from being set in motion if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices reduce the number of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: curb these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some commercial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second program, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced them to use their hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time ... Are you from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel are.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon consisting of 27 navy soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the room where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter awaits them.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in banks in doubtful insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel."
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"...or problems.
The bleak aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce to think not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a songroom inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, which does not Paris and probably does not exist a designer more exquisite and bont vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from the emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the fashion designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala board prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take your breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a big boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as a knight who he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both surrendered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in pants and shirt – drawn by her own hand – turned for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie."
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us earlier the photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The following day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big guy who moves by motorbike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having secured himself previously, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, there, we have the way.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget about chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they’re all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the frenetic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty in disembarking from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of options tailored to each's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this "manual" disproves that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline doesn’t already flow in your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak during the night.
I'm not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you take a scare, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you were told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (each day, once a week, once in the month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night fears, nighttime enuresis (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overexcitement situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, shouts, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any question that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety such as venting to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the baby before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepiloquies appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you'd interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's asleep and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check from where such great anxiety in the child results.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), don't fall into the temptation to make him an interrogation to get information.
You will not get anything, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous distress.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way back to victory at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable match, the Yellow-blacks created the most opportunities from the net by turning one into the victory of the match.
The pace was not very sustained during this match where the attackers hardly expressed themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who grazed the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to get the better of it and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain of the tip and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the middle of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in the tip of attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after Marais's first goal for Illhaeusern, well positioned, he would resume a rejected ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern's gunner will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put much trouble to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, backed up just to "strengthen" the defense, save in the last minutes of the game when, after a bombastic action, the ball was touching the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Brittany.
In front of the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant the representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "it will come up with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to make working conditions and sailor pay safe."
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy at the foot.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not stopped.
A road blockade has been implemented on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already tested their determination by burning, starting from dawn, tires and paddles in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking hold demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the dock, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of ships from trade.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known refinery Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the eventual participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not give in" et "they have no intention of moving to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but estimate that the return limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, aged 83, at his Connecticut home.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the recessionary threats weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest company in the industry, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the range of between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15 percent of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, put back on its feet by the American monetary authorities, would sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollar loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of the life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper specifies on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG's board of directors met on Sunday night to consider any disposals, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from the AIG.
The assets that the AIG plans to divest include the International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been made with regard to such disposals, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly source liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities take over 80% of its capital.
Paris: chronicle Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic plunge on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst of the losses in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the index of major tech stocks, lost 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81 per cent (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55, according to the closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plunged after the unexpected rejection of the banks' bailout, thought to bring stability back to the markets.
With 228 votes to the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it may already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – the American Federal Reserve – and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And highlighting again the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, the Piegza stressed.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favour of UK banks, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 3.632 percent, against 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield is at 4.161 percent, against 4.357 percent the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, which has been received following a sharp decline in its shares on the stock exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional deal, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stocks at an individual cost of 25.25 dollars, or a sum equal to three billion dollars.
The established price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of US$31.25, ensuring a 10 percent return.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would take place on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars in title, that is a percentage lower than its current course of 28%.
At around 17.00, however, the Morgan Stanley stock fell 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into bank holding company," explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new bylaws last week, which should allow it to differentiate its actions by passing it under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought our shareholding would be exclusively composed of common stock.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will get Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their 7% book value.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by the MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide clarification regarding the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has specified that it has "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has surged.
However, the cost of reducing it to a high level, around 12%, was rising on Monday.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the survey of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had levied 15 billion dollars, in part at the Berkshire Hathaway, group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa à Quito, ce lundi.
Establishing the republic on a socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, of the Bolivian Evo Morales et of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
A mission carried out since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while 7% of the vote was null and 0.7% blank ballots.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half of the vote, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-government organization had announced a crushing victory of the "yes" vote, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The scrutiny, which took place calmly according to the Organization of American States' (OEA) Election Observation Mission, was based on a 444-point text to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially of the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced plans to exploit this amendment and to re-propose their candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama ahead of first TV duel
After Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, here's a second one to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the TV duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the drop in the polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published Saturday accords a five-point lead to Obama (49% versus 44 percent for McCain), shows the Democrat got the better of it.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters, found that 39 percent of them deem Obama the winner, while 25 percent bet on McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected in the course of the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain never stopped promoting his own unquestionable foreign policy experience, underscoring the opponent's "naivety" regarding the arguments addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What from yesterday constitutes a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, pointed out how his election would represent a new future.
Without dwelling, he proved to be concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, as opposed to Obama," he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic commercial, rebuking the Republican for not taking the necessary steps to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20 000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could represent a decisive breakthrough," he considered, yesterday, the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic insight to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of poor economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain."
Reiterating its intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's gasps, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for its part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dodged the questions focused on the 700 billion dollar financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night just after the polling stations closed in Minsk's central square to protest the fraudulent character of the legislatives.
While still awaiting the results, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some confess they didn't even vote :" A what pro? They're going to do what they want, of my vote," says one guy.
They do not believe that that regime that has made a good impression of foreign observers with the aim of resuming in dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian executives and asset freezes, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of votes," complained Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of facade," points out Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case is the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "we must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Since if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the ballot.
He points out that the participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has started any kind of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there was an election? He is calling for Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the two last political prisoners freed this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five opposition deputies in parliament, the most affordable in power."
The night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the central electoral commission are pleased with their success.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts seized ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, safe and sound, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo's international airport, around 15 and 30, aboard a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any interview to the press, at the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom was paid "to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, shortly before dawn.
"There were gunfire, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the person responsible who requested to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would support German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we got that result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any more details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army on patrol had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the kidnappers were located and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to an organization of rebels from Darfur, the movement for the liberation of Sudan, (SLA_U), an assertion immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The silent majority of culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will say to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that go hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and property buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon, in the Loire valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers are grouped into 211 companies for the protection of historical, genealogical, archives and property heritage preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is precisely they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The meeting - Blood is safe again
The Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dott.ssa FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as the Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the re-proposition of a similar disaster.
As Judge Krever was in delay in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was executed by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports Gélineau et Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Society of Blood) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started their activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary said.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood draws and field research over the following years, we regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dott.ssa Décary is however convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we absolutely did not know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are adopted.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for some years now, it has been shown that without a doubt this disease is transmitted by infected blood.
This episode thus showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the same, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to the moment in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to a duration of less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them has thus decreased considerably.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people run the risk of receiving infected blood from the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that you will need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples every year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is found.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of management of the Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood from an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," continues Dott.ssa Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, the Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
"Necessities increase as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer cures, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average makes up only 3% of Quebecers acceptable as donors.
However, all healthy people who are over 18 years of age and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Cases of scarcity are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them and incite them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that you find it hardly an hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of US$297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eye globe heart valves, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which operates the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical deviation, blood rich in stem cells abounds that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the inclusion in the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand every year.
You should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dott.ssa Décary, which describes this practice of taking cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to have access to it", since the Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals of Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final of the Serie A eliminatories, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Sounders, yesterday, during a decisive second quarter-final match at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first half without a goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first game of the first-round, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face Vancouver's Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a 3-1 first in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-final.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed later in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Centro Bell.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for the win, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory the only net signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the early period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the match.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest is aiming for the North
The prime minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year.
At the end of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected in the partial elections today.
"Expand the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Moult to images."
On three maxi screens, they were confused with the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the North-the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister merely explained why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential" but did not rule on timing or investment quotas, just as he did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At most, he limited himself to pointing out what he believes deserves a priority position: hydro-electricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which, following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced several improvements.
According to Charest's list, the North contains nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds.
That "topern twice the size of France" is here, is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: gold fever in Habits, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a boundary line on which there has been no agreement in place in a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he indicated.
Moreover, "considering climate change, we must re-evaluate the North", he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would prove very attentive to this matter and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) occupies an important position, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also abide by the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, tidy and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the pre-emptive liberal prime ministers.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of the Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of the James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another conservative, this time, reference was used by the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest said its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will succeed," he confessed to his militants, stirring up heartfelt applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of starting a ballot in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He emphasizes that he is certainly very committed, especially in a Federal Council mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly as oil: the PLQ primarily calls for recognition of "Quake's specificity" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the outline of the North Plan was welcomed in a skeptical manner.
PQ leader Pauline Marois dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In your opinion, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done it," we would have progressed today" commented Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of the North Plan.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a spectacle," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, who returned just today from vacation.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To disgrace in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about it both on the entourage of the prime minister, and on the same Stephen Harper.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated a citizen of his detained in the concentration camp of Guantanamo.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time the facts took place.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, disavows its own word and lets a child-soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilty of the accused.
For information, we recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadraffin to be subject to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: he cares very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop flaunting and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any morals: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government to date minority (to see what will become of it after October 14...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here is the shame, Mr. Toews, in the renunciation of all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million-million-on-art libel lawsuit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a libel lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring about ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a substantial amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, to decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the virtually bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal weapons struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that gags the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to pronounce on the issue again.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that he would have to present his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally held with the exchange of views and not with baton shots.
It would therefore have been enough for society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much faith in public opinion and misrejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his disdain for that same audience is well evident?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only indicates the handsomely paid lawyers and not the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even disparagers have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports Black Canadian authors and publishers does so first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of gagging (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum informing them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, the lawsuit brought by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on university freedom of research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies in block the right to the citation of authentic sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss on uncomfortable topics to the richest companies in the world, on pain of multiple lawsuits, who can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific norms as the authors of Black Canada do.
He has the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as well as the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that can limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - bailout for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic side, yesterday finally came to an agreement on the biggest financial-saving plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been burdening Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides in particular: verifications of its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes foreclosed for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection of wages paid to managers of protected enterprises.
The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress in view of an effective agreement on the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said in a statement.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the crisis currently underway on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted this way, priceless discomfort and upset would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
After the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, without, however, avoiding expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will allow owners to keep their domicile and that inherent in wages intended for business executives covered by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the screen of American TV.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"According to what I've read, this is something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsaless assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk ( mortgages) , and then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in office who screwed up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since Democrats agreed that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies would only be protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, in Congress, a provision has been added that, if the government were to cope with losses over the course of five years to come due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which can be added again 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The 350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shareholdings in the protected companies that will be worth the dividends in case of profit and that he can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures related to real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the plan's architects would like to submit it to the House of Representatives vote, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, he is still not sure that the green light to their plan will be given.
In fact yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and Democratic side.
"Evidently, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituent voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward," he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the world nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas said it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In return, influence and voting rights are collected in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are announcing uncertainly
During this time, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in the balance for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently underway at the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Blue-eyed beauty was for a long time its ace up its sleeve, for others its weak point.
Had he gotten rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday, aged 83, on his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American film of the spledge years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples, magical children are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the latest quality mark.
Since in him he recognized himself a whole country in love with the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, who in the early 50's studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, on television and soon in cinema.
That same civil rights militant man was also the racing driver who ranked second to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple from 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadows of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show-business, of which the mystery will never be completely revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's passing was a heart dive for the cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of full-changing American cinema is repurposed through its interpretations.
They blend in into the memory of Butch Cassidy's charming cow-boy (1969) and that boy unable to wish for his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Rooftop Cat He Burns Adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
So many other Paul Newman have gone down in history.
The rocky Graziano boxer, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up there someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute thug in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
Bitter and vindictive pool player in The Slot, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar for 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was his.
Still him.
The ages are happening through his path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a last-ditch role as godfather of the Irish mafia in Era my father, in 2003.
Unlike the most popular film legends that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glitz, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French amateur, called him, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying," judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic carrion or desperate, of which he expressed disarray and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, traced a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes that rained down yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift, dies.
We will have oversighted his face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was intended for its Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that he said" Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there, it was a privilege."
And the same privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag invoice factory & associates?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from notices of competition, was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the execution of activities through false invoices.
State and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from notices of competition on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the accusatory act, most of the invoices were false.
To do them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the trip through the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, on the model of these then were prepared the invoices to be forwarded to the notices of competition, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri who, according to our information, has drawn up above all the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados's "journey studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the place of catering provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the restaurant together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however 130 guests were in the invoice.
But the compilers of the invoices full of imagination exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., also this deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and they showed him the invoices, he quickly realised that it was fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT number of our enterprise were in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the invoice was catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The regular invoice compilers did not bother to inquire that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's invoices practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the survey, VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply VAT at 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover the employees of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the procedure of the Public Prosecutor's Office, activities that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Moreover, for formal defects - cause non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are fake.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied issuing the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had lunch, for this reason the administrator of the company's liquidation, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have issued invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice broadcasters consists of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the accusatory act, persuaded the director of the Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity
Not even a movement of money because the prepared invoices were then reversed, but the associations forgot to show this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who are connectable with the defendants.
E.g. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to deliver the general manager of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company released several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of IT means, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 has purchased these invoices.
The director-general of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov submitted documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices in the name of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons, they founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, none of the companies were operational, because according to the accused they had not received work.
However, the companies came in handy because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the foundation documents of the companies, in the name of the companies, invoices were issued to the associations linked to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the Cash Investment companies, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov released 15 invoices to the various institutions for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The prosecutors believe that Kubatov has pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a call for the Socialist Party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
In order for this not to come to the surface, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received by the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It must be seen if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for now could have also been offended given that his requests for easing his conditions of imprisonment, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have so far found no fulfillment.
While non-reparable commercial offenders and causing much larger damages can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excess licitating: why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have managed to uncover the neuro-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study that appeared in the journal Science men do not want to fall behind in a race such as eBay's auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system via experimental rods.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the game of the auction, where the substantial element is to squirre more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex intensely enters into operation when lost at the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the research group's economists carried out a financial pursuit survey.
In this investigation, three groups have licited against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told how much the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group instead would receive 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money in case of loss at auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was underlined, while for the other the loss.
By substituting the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winning."
“These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These, in fact, so far explained the phenomena found at the auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to contact your doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of these only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver disease caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against the A and B viruses, against the C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots are formed on the skin and white of the eyes, the stools become clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because pathogens sneakily destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed.
In the world to date, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory test reveals the disease is worth turning to the GP when noticing any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is treatable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
The Benelux governments nationalize a part of the Fortis bank
The states of the Benelux help through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, who ended up in difficulty first in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level at the weekend, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the areas of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debating for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
Under the decision taken Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share present in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interest, including first and foremost the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then presented themselves in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares on Friday fell nearly 12 percent, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the group's entire capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The company summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US$700 billion plan.
On Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new chief executive of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has submitted with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid of losing the money.
Among the bank's customers there was no panic, branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous branches and has also purchased lease companies.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in god affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph said.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and to as many atheists, while all those observed a painting depicting the virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was found that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of researches in which in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the ermine by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would originate a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to be of a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time aro received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the Virgin Mary's vision made them feel "safe," as if "someone took care" of them and "reassured themselves and were pervaded by peace."
Looking at the religious-themed image they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work ahead of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but we must find the suitable image.
“We must look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality.” – Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the day of his tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as much as in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, what surgery they attend and what they are interested in.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is not enough yet.
What concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of the Google founders that was: “We put all the information in the world in a system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning to be able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years’ time Schmidt replied: would he like if Google knew how to answer questions such as “what do I do tomorrow?” or “what would be the right job for me?”, but the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their searches on the internet exactly the words searched are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users can, for example, can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our preferences declared and recorded previously.
What if my data is being used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - they ask users worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the counterreactions of Internet users are provoked by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion in power.
However, a fact is confirmed, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in reasoned cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against the pedophiles of Brazil, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights instead sighed with relief in May when the company - agreed with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later you can not force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government has successfully snatched almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years before, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear providing their personal data lash out of Google because they believe that their intimate sphere and private life are affected by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of the great companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, however much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code always kept up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most often repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels available to us, and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all these can insert them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read about numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, easily learns with those who spent the night her evil boyfriend or a company can fire an employee of hers because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is safe, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the Google monopoly can do so (for example, starting with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not register on purpose to community pages for not being found, Google online applications, from word processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far in existence.
The public does not even wait so secretly for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars in value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause major hurries not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers, along with all this, find alarming points: the company summit, for example, has completely refused the protest of employees after having doubled the fee of the company asylum, has considered too expensive the repeated catering at the daily pleasure of employees, but all this diminishes in the face that in 2006 Google bowed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is sure, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world in one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines of Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon be faced with the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the short story Scroogled of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped Ózd's double killer make the tracks disappear
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Police Police Headquarters of the Borsod region.
The young men have recognized the offence against them, they are currently charged with abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on the loose.
Abetment is punishable up to 5 years imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, on Sunday was put in pre-trial detention.
He's suspected of multiple premeditated murders committed for profit.
The investigation found that the young twenty-three-year-old had a big debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he lured his creditor with a deception at a construction site in Ózd where he and his 9-year-old daughter killed him.
According to the information of the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of the use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the share list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer put forward by the Poles despite the Czechs previously ruling out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that it intends to sell more than 60% of its securities in a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlant Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have been offered a bid.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the close of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kronor.
Under the shareholder agreement almost 90 percent of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Homeland Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11."
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who was not able to compact his own party behind a haste-wrapped law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett put it, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the world will suffer later.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave out the threat - hints the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout doughnut to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayers' money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term, European Union member states need to overcome their national selfishness and focus control over dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday the weakened financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that even European taxpayers, similar to those of America, will have to put their hand to their portfolio to remedy the crisis, seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not worried much about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "saviors" must not immediately wave the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent bigger damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies if not mimic the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
For example, those of bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hornets gave the initial strategic starting point to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of collision-resistant systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic miniauto equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
Flying the bees form their own personal oval space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - he explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the field of PR technologies and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the view of the bee.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two metres apart within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damable and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is considered currently inevitable.
The whole process must mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to avoid the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, higher-energy, lithium-polymer batteries, which means their lifespan is higher than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot must process some inputs in seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvering data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
No need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, Nissan predicts, can be installed on production vehicles within 10 years.
Further application possibilities can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles on the road leads to the destination.
They also found the name to the very expensive child
The written version of the 700 billion dollar economic rescue law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drawn up, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast schedule, congressional leaders decided on the 700 billion dollar bailout after a debate that had lasted for days.
Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, said: “We have made serious progress, according to the fact that there is only one left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson talking about the outcome of the compromise said: the program will work and it will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi it is not about the bailout of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic bandwagon.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. according to Washington time (2 a.m. Monday night according to Central European time), but did not bring big stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft economic stabilization law of 2008 concerning the program, after it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke Saturday night with Pelosi, then welcomed the news of the deal with joy at the White House.
We are pleased with the progress we have made tonight and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
The program however differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which predicted that the 700 billion dollars would all be spent on the purchase of the securities with disproportionate credits behind.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after Monday's vote of Congress, with these the Ministry of the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits at the same time.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an adequate price for the likely damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to come for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it's buying the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to make us ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their good exit, defined by overseas slang simply as a golden parachute.
The payment restrictions will only take place in some cases, plus the limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the deceased bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
To this must be added that the already existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the pay of the general administrators - commented the measure the Democrat Barney Frank chairman of the commission in charge of the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, decreasing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn it if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will get back on its feet.
The proposed bill includes that over the next five years the president must present Congress with a proposal that has how to return taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us, not to defend taxpayer dollars, said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.

Industrial domestic sales prices compared to the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the processing sector also rose to a minimal extent, 0.1%, compared with July.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with a 2.5% monthly increase.
The high level of the price of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemicals sector.

The prices of paper production, publishing and typographical activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas carried out by the authorities from 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the national sales of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the processing sector of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metalworking products, the price increase was 13.2%, and 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco were a key burden.
A decrease in prices was in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer articles the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Industrial export sales prices calculated in guilders grew in August by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, compared in 12 months they fell by 3.9%.
The Hungarian guilder within a month weakened against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the American-Hungarian visa-waiver agreement could come into force - the foreign minister spoke about that in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion "now it all depends on the fact of the overseas seat is being built in time the electronic system of entry and control."
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The Hungarian diplomacy chief will continue negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Medal of the Order of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and enter into talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also stood in favor of the banks' bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two big American parties, on Sunday guaranteed their support for the 700 billion dollar government plan for the bank bailout, but there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Treasury minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after marathon negotiations lasted for days, on Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bank bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of free-credit market release have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more fit than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the foreground of economic issues Obama has again regained some advantage, while the advantage of McCain, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would swiftly pass the 700 billion dollar plan bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that have also been supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all the industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let slip of defining out of touch on McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all of us will send this situation down with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a viable way."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a control committee of the finance minister and the limitation of the good exits of the top managers, things on which he was the one to insist.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a meritful role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives will probably vote on Monday on the bill.
German-speaking world press review
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is set to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Revolution of Bavaria devours his parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian-socialists have been remodernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, so is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday, however, a process ended that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had plunged to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the consequent modernization in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists predicted it already 40 years ago, but they got the time wrong. However, secularization, the results of education, the establishment of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, artisans, graduates and graduates.
Here support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian domestic political situation created as a result of the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now it all revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red deals.
As he said, the collaboration will surely not succeed if Faymann attempts to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
If his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition it is still an open thing in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Nert coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing," Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris began the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MP of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and moreover the most serious obstacle to their claim.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights-advocating organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to the discrimination in recruitment, that the Roma are ousted from the labor market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a medium-level degree and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a paltry number of them can achieve a higher degree."
Mr Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in asserting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the congresswoman it is necessary to make aware in the broader scope between the Roma and non-Roma these links.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market grow; through the taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the congresswoman, the European Union's union of purpose and action is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, the opportunities granted by the democratic space must be given to Roma children so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the name of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, from the meeting in Berlin last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program that means the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the data subject.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies make the insurance fee and the amount due in the event of claims subject to the health status of the customer and if they consider the risk not to be too high, they do not take out the insurance.
Some time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily have information from pharmacies about which medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program evinces which diseases he suffers from and in what health condition he is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that your blood fat level is incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to paper work there is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are employable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is the same as a factor of increased risk, the first two not.
For the request and data processing, separate companies were formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities oblige them to do so even if so far they have not imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have recently also developed the result of laboratory tests and linked them to the consumption data medicine in order to provide a more precise picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and in parallel the control of usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
Before Congress there is a proposed law giving the authorities supervisory expertise to companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the forwarding of data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the awkward couple Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the ugly electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, the Bavarian CSU was for the moment postponed the discussion of personal issues.
Party President Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is how long pity lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case not to be attacked with all their might to the chair.
They tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day later the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded the personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the time at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union got 60.7%, now after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, the Conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy always count, in the future they will be forced to join in.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, obtains a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exponents of right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange twist of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treated the woman without regard by the great ambitions.
CSU executives now focus all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber, who was plotting in the shadows, will also get an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements to the gall against the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is not put back together with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the CSU's ground loss will not adversely affect Berlin's grand coalition.
Certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats instead still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even an opposition representative entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead, it is explained by the frauds committed in the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held in debated circumstances, "granted" a few seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced an earlierly assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which called for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in the possession of the Beltransgaz that run through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
It referred to a détente that the OSCE by assessing the election campaign has placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the prohibition to show up for a third of the opposition candidates.
Monday's report by the OSCE, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to have a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has been considering the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition presidential candidate of the 2006 election it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "power has been afraid to bring even a single opponent into a weightless Parliament."
The opposition does not foresee protest actions for the results but rather tries to get voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the most officially helped class, that of pensioners, considers the regime of Lukashenko adequate, which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's debt and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time for the disintegration of social security "reminiscent of the burial silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Independent States Community, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseilla Menu
European Union and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners that trade primarily for each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting has also been dominated by this issue, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union acknowledges the fact that India is becoming a major democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to endorse New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no insistence on this issue at the ninth summit organised yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in 5 years, i.e. increase trade to 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious a goal.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been unified from a legal point of view, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India by the end of 2009 would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted attention to global matters.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the commercial Doha Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as the fact that a global pact should be made at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister will travel to the French capital today where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors the French companies will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our news agency the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt awaits for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be institutionally present with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books on the total of Italian production progressively decreases, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure against the cunning, against those who stamp and then go for a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-slacker novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" the minister specifies.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism," Brunetta points out again.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistance from employees, the general secretary assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the cooperation of everyone."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Word of Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months the absences due to illness of civil servants have been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people at work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates."
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Function flags today numbers about the least absenteeism at work for causes of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'industrious slackers' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of employees of the public administration have been corrected and productive in Italy who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree ".
In particular, the TAR will be challenged the exclusion of additional economic treatment for infirmity dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which the check-ups are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalids of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "deep appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, an outraged 'enough' has risen, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, for their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality proposes us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people entering the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to give up in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a decisive commitment aimed at urgently ending it."
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, like this "downward trend" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is easing that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school".
"We need a further effort - he added - regarding the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection expected for victims of work" and the "welfare drift towards which the system is pushing in recent years."
"The goal therefore is to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who get injured should not depend on spontaneism or giving from time to time arranged by the legislature."
Mp3 readers under indictment, put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement issued in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csreri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - the note reads - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than one hour a day holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I worry that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - continues the EU manager - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are growing.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by using solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music for only 5 hours per week at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) exceed the current limits on maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5 to 10% of users of such appliances and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took office this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Board and the City Council will evaluate analysis and projects, so that we can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are represented all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno points out - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Council and the City Council, will then be able to make use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time term.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, given that their opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of everyday life and on the emergencies that are expedited from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome points out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a bandwagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses."
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level leap, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a spirit unified to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome specifies "will not be limited to the only current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. Here's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants to pass as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote in a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big tough face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!
In fact they are attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know who will give his vote the American patriot.
It comes out a side of the U.S. mindset kept covered to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll take care of where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home kicking in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Still, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to perform.
USA, the economic meltdown is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "murderer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the big public understands it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the nationally-wide journalism is taking a wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a gap towards the internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest split today in American journalism is between who directs the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56 percent of executives domestically are sure their reporters divide their values, while locally the percentage drops to 23 percent.
For some this has to do with "job security."
Executives who think they're losing their jobs within 3 years are at 47 percent nationally.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors almost always receive large wages, while the editor can earn even 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and payment of insurance.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to get to 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAIN IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the counter-pact investigation related to the Unipol-Bnl climbdown.
In the course of the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from the domiciliaries transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate manager could travel the journey from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the PM gave a contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House of Representatives vote against the 700 billion dollar bailout launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans were, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirms that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to “those of Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, who became strongly alive with the vow of which I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is just one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the economic earthquake in progress perhaps heralds or already lets it be seen: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to be operating as an accelerator of incubating phenomena for some time that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-acting, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, yes, dense links with foreign countries, but which first of all involve the balance sheets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems basically out of the game or not having much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union that divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when you get to the corners it is only the states that own the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to get things back on track.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose in a similar way.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is moreover in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attach to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal with those very unintangible things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presages a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take matters into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, especially economic, proved so inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insuffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of countries in the West.
That seems to be increasingly making way, in large sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, undergroundly feeds an ramified but mighty movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "electoral revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and very last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, they are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep strata of Western societies and that the economic crisis reinvigorates, increases, agitates potentially to a great extent.
In the face of all this, talking about a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue for walking on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to us.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure a perfect grip on the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily detaches from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING ON THE WALLS? "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be aerospace engineering.
For the moment no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California is also looking for a new sticker.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed from microfibers such as hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, when taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness as appropriate with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, and from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already ended up under indictment because it was believed to be responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to the extent toxic.
The same Italian Medicines Agency had given notice of it in an information bulletin two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what is drunk in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that possibly change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is anything that is not clear to us, do not be impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification", stressed the expert at the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on the patterns of trade and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's foreign economics and policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in The New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked quite a few controversies and that for years was refuted by the economist, but which has now proved to be exact.
“I’m surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of the scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "highly valuable economist", but also a popularizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem is watching, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with different news: to the welcome screen and to the revised interface and made less spartan, we add other more substantial ones such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some forms such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by e-mail, or the ability to import PDF files in the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene several-handed between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the word processor, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some of OpenOffice’s features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be shipped to the home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a tow for dissemination in homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite attempts the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is also no shortage of companies that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for videowriting corresponding to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulus presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it's the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber jersey.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Tests of Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity to Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and will meet the two-year canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positives.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey of best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES WONDER, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asked in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the NYT calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support to the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Even the new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendency underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Steve Fossett's plane found billionaire missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 3000 meters altitude, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, though, there were no human remains.
Madeira County sheriff John Anderson dismissed the doubts that still remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it's just what Steve Fossett was flying about the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was given up for dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (NTSB) said that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the wreckage was sent, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's belongings had been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents called Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's searches had been stopped a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the round-the-world tour of an aerobastic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had gone around the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters in height, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An SUV outside the box with an original design and well defined by strong lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the latest born among the "compact" offroads of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of news in this sector.
Precisely because of its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the GLC SUV, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
So the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D billboards, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-billboards, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central Milan shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is attempting to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will he be able with this formula to tease the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are
Del Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of which all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" that has been following the Italian national team for years and that so far, in truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with opposing fans.
The group draw is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the militants' hometowns appear: on Saturday night they were taken out for not being identified.
They are inspired by English supporter.
In Bulgaria they found a fan of real Nazis, that of the Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a record of stadium offenses, had been refused the ticket and prevented the trip.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those just over a hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they argue from the Viminale.
So, "eyes well open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce."
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the outstretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime..."
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the place that was first by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the quaestor of Trieste where there is a core group of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the no. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles at Mameli's anthem: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me I'm not education..."
Students victims of the dear-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that the families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market to trigger a process of generalized increase even for residents ".
In most cases, rental offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, rent-bound, sub-rentable contracts.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the tax, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you range from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You only save if you move to outlying areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina areas, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee requested by foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historic halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the suburbs of large multiplexes and the consequent death by consumption of the monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and full of memory "it is as if a friend was lost, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial room and nostalgia for a way of living the cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by ANEC, the main association of exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and to pay the biggest price are mainly the theaters in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna is Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost single-sale cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And demonstrating that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it is useful that new structures are built but we should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move in the multiplexes.
Not to mention the non-allocation for the fund in favor of merchants: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is disgraceful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run for cover with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-room cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules provided for are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso", to which I thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale now closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by dust I turn to the other side".
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to conform the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli cosca."
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, of the boss's namesake, already convicted of association for mafia-style crimes, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already significant, of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusion between local authorities and organized underworld there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cosca.
Since the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 runoff.
He shouted the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having concocted everything for a political matter, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli cosca had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group famously close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca."
When energy is born from the waves, the bigs take the field
It is an exterminated field, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the big energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have set their eyes, and now they try to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of deriving energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70's, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by oil-intended power plants.
That amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition there would be currents and tides.
Colossi to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years later, to bet on marine energy are more and more and among these companies always devoted to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies, and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us,” a company’s spokesperson familiar with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a significant sign, especially considering that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to the Chevron are New York's Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey's Ocean Power to walk the road of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, however unknown in detail, indicate according to observers a rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, not least because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants being designed, pending only federal approval and part of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides makes the turbine blades turn, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
The Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves the potential of tides right now.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states such as that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and expected investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
