[Roberto Battiston] Daring, having the courage to go to space.
The space is the object of charm, dream, danger.
What you see is a small solar phenomenon that happened a few years ago: a small spot emitted a large 'burst' of particles, plasma, and sun-spot 1.692, exactly as big as the Earth.
What happened in the hours, in the following days: a very large mass of particles, plasma, energy, two days later arrived on Earth and what happened illuminated the skies of Northern Europe with formidable Northern Lights, never seen before.
But only this happened, because the Earth is protected from the phenomena around space, a hostile space, by at least three elements: the magnetic field that deflects the particles, our planet that fends us in part and the atmosphere, which is like having two and a half meters of aluminum in front of us that protect us from particles.
But if we were on our way to Mars, if we did what so many years, since the time of von Brown, we want to do, conquer the Red Planet with astronauts, what would protect us?
How could we be able to resist this and all the other challenges that space offers us?
The space we have conquered: this is the International Space Station, as big as a football field, can accommodate up to nine astronauts.
It is the technological jewel of modern times.
It's something absolutely fantastic.
Samantha Cristoforetti, Luca Parmitano: our astronauts have been hosted for months in this great space hotel where they managed to resist the hostility of space.
But during the mission, in Luca Parmitano, something unpredictable happened: a small pump that managed the cooling of the spacesuit with which Parmitano was walking in space, working outside the Space Station, broke down.
He started to lose liquid: half a glass of water that, however, began to float in the helmet, aspired from the nose and mouth.
He was about to drown in a glass of water in space.
Who would have imagined it?
No one.
It was about to happen.
He was saved because the other comrades quickly brought him inside the inhabited space and he could get rid of this half-glass of water in which he was drowning.
What is it that we miss?
We lack materials that can repair themselves, systems that can protect themselves automatically.
Where can we look for this kind of new technology?
[Nicola Pugno] Nature is, of course, able to self-repair.
We see it every day: when we scratch ourselves thank goodness, we can then repair ourselves.
Even recently, since the 2,000 years, from an engineering point of view, we manage to mimic this feature a bit.
The concept is very simple: you can also imagine it by referring to this projection.
Imagine putting capsules inside a traditional material.
These capsules, in turn, contain a kind of glue, so to speak, on microcapsules, there are many widespread everywhere.
When the crack propagates and tends to split my structure also splits the capsules that release this liquid that goes to sew the crack and therefore, in essence, we have a material that has self-repaired.
It's something that already exists.
There are even paints that manage to self-repaire, so if they are scratched they sew themselves up.
[Roberto] Very useful technology!
This is part of a more general picture in which we mimic nature.
[Nicola] Well, of course!
Imitating nature is something that has always been done.
Think also of Leonardo's studies, just about flying.
Observing the flight of the birds, we tried to build the first machines to go and fly.
Certainly inspiration is important, rather than mimicking tout-court nature.
The planes do not slam, for example, the wings, but we have obtained very remarkable results that we use, alas, every day.
[Roberto] Very well, then, at this point, it will mean that the next time we have to repair a piece of the Space Station, we look, in this case, at a panel that was carried out, almost 80 meters long, at one point showed a crack and the astronaut had to sew and sew, repair with a fatigue and a huge risk.
It would take more resistant materials that do not break, that can withstand the hostility of space, folding, opening.
[Nicola] Well, certainly one possibility is to self-repair, another is that they do not split.
So, to take inspiration, the most tenacious material, which has the greatest ability to dissipate energy before breaking, is the spider's silk.
The spiders are exceptional: think that even any spider that you find around is able to make up to seven different types of silks.
Here you see the silk spin apparatus.
It can therefore produce materials that are either extremely resistant or extremely tenacious, or able to dissipate even more energy with structural solutions that we will then see and are also sticky to block prey.
They can do some really incredible things.
To give an idea, this material is ten times more tense than the Kevlar.
Here you see a junction at the web itself, you have an additional length of silk inside a droplet and this further increases the ability to dissipate energy of the spider web, of the structure.
In doing so an insect is blocked and so the spider has been able to evolve and survive to this day.
[Roberto] Spider's canvas is something extraordinary.
There are very special materials in the space.
For example, a helicopter on Mars would need, due to the much reduced atmosphere compared to the Earth’s atmosphere, of blades that spin much more quickly, that are much larger and lighter.
We don’t know how to do them today: even the most durable materials like carbon fiber struggle to withstand these really special stresses.
[Nicola] Yes, carbon is actually the fiber that we know today, from an engineering, at least macroscopic, most resistant point of view ever.
Six GigaPascal: six times the strength of steel.
Theoretically there is a material that is even more resistant, at least from an ideal point of view, and it is a single layer of carbon atoms: the famous, so to speak, graphene.
More layers of this graphene then make the graphite we have in our pencils, not resistant because the planes flow between them, but the single sheet of graphite is extremely durable.
A resistance of 100 times the steel, at least theoretically.
In this way we can certainly do the blades of a helicopter to go to Mars and it could also have application on Earth.
Many people failed to be rescued in Nepal, because we didn't have helicopters to go below a certain altitude.
But we can also do even more extravagant things such as, for example, a space elevator cable to be able to bring mass from Mars to space at very low costs with advantages that we know well because the elevators we use.
[Roberto] But if we wanted, beyond a very durable single layer, to have complex structural materials that we need for a whole series of applications, what has nature done in this sector?
[Nicola] Then this is very important.
We use carbon fibers in the materials of other matrices to build composite materials.
When we mix things, unfortunately, for defects and many other things, the resistance falls.
Indeed, carbon-based composites today are not so resistant.
But there are natural composites.
We recently observed composite, biological material with maximum strength and found it in the nails of the flaps.
Going to take these elements, trying the tractions, we saw a mechanical resistance of six GigaPascal, that is much greater than the composites that man today is able to do.
[Roberto] Exceptional, we are truly collecting a truly extraordinary amount of input and suggestions from nature.
Well, one of the problems we have in space, both in low orbits and traveling deep, are what are called space waste, micrometeorites.
They move so fast at 7, 8, 10 kilometers per second that even a very small object - here we have the example of an inch of a metal ball - slamming against 18 centimeters of aluminum thickness practically pierced it, deformed it for the enormous energy it dissipated with a mode that material as such could not absorb.
We would need screens, much more resistant protections.
What can we look at nature in this regard?
[Nicola] Think of insects.
Nature has evolved absolutely in this context.
The armor of insects is an example.
Here we see in particular a very interesting beetle, the so-called bomber beetle, which manages to emit this fluid at high temperature and at great pressure to get rid of its enemies.
That’s why, you may have noticed, I got scared earlier when the drummer emitted these streams, they remembered this thing a bit that we observe here.
The beetle has this very remarkable peculiarity, because imagine the material that makes up the internal combustion chamber.
You see, it has this very light structure but it also has this undulating surface and this undulating surface seems to be the key to resist explosions further, as in this case, but also impacts.
In fact, by doing simulations, - you see a diagram of a numerical simulation in the lower right - we have observed that, on the same mass, equal to the average thickness of this slab, if undulating with a certain undulation, the protective capacity becomes much greater.
You might think, tomorrow, of making screens for spaceships to Mars inspired by the bomber beetle.
[Roberto] Exceptional, but another problem we have in space is that we need very large structures and when we leave with our missiles by definition they can only be folded back.
One difficulty for space engineering is to be able to open them, eventually to close them, reliably, using lightness, when we are in space, and flexibility and folding when we are still leaving for Earth.
It's one of the hardest things to make sure mechanics develop and get back in place as far as we want.
From this point of view, what can nature tell us?
[Nicola] Nature can tell us, as always, so much.
You see a simple ladybug.
‘Very simple’ is said, ‘very common’, I would say.
The ladybug can explain the wings without any problem, it manages to fold them.
Imagine the complexity The folds thanks to a system of ribs on the wings, which are also structural for the wings, but which, with a kind of elastic stability, so to speak, manages to open and close in a somewhat discontinuous way, therefore in a very controlled way, these wings.
So we could imagine doing something similar to control the opening and closing of these panels very well.
[Roberto] This is really technology of the third millennium: we need to make an absolutely extraordinary leap to go and do something that nature has already learned and can do for billions of years.
We went to Mars, we landed: we need the resources.
The first resource for the astronaut is water.
We know that on Mars there is water, icy, under the various layers of the ground, but that there is also an atmosphere.
So some amount of water in the Martian atmosphere must be there.
If we could recover the water of the atmosphere as we do on Earth it would be extremely useful.
What could we do, taking a cue from nature?
[Nicola] There are organisms that can do this.
Think, for example, of the cactus.
Here I would like to bring a different example: it is another beetle, the beetle of Namibia, a desert beetle, which has a surface that is composed of two hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.
That is, materials that, on the one hand, manage to attract water and, on the other, absolutely manage to make it flow very well.
This combination of two types of surfaces within the same macroscopic surface makes him manage to recover a lot of water and therefore manages to survive in desert environments.
[Roberto] Fabulous: beetles that take water from the air.
But, speaking of surfaces, we would need self-cleaning surfaces.
For example, this is one of the rovers on the Martian surface.
After a few months, it was covered with dust: the solar panels, which we see on the left, are completely unusable.
Fortunately, every now and then, beyond the storms there are lighter winds, small whirlwinds that clean up and, fortunately, put it back in place as on the right.
But if we had surfaces that are inherently self-cleaning, that manage to eliminate any form of deposit, we certainly would be even more prepared to take an interplanetary journey.
[Nicola] Self-cleaning surfaces in nature certainly there are; the most famous is the lotus leaf, so much so that we talk about lotus effect.
Here you can see some droplets of water flowing on this surface.
It gives you the very clear idea of how this is water repellent, super hydrophobic, in this sense, and it is a particular surface, so much so that it is considered sacred by some populations, because, despite living in marshes, in dirty places, it always manages to be very clean.
This is basically thanks to a superficial topology invisible to the naked eye, but that under a microscope is highlighted very well.
A particular topology thanks to which, basically, the material becomes recently hydrophobic to super hydrophobic, from a chemical point of view.
It is therefore clear that, going to mimic this topology, which today can be done with nanotechnology, we can basically change the properties of ‘wetability’ – that is, of interaction with water – of surfaces.
Here you see, for example, a plastic surface inspired by the lotus leaf that we have made, simply with this invisible topology with the naked eye, the interaction with the fluid changes dramatically.
[Roberto] Exceptional!
One of the things we've seen, an imitation of nature is the famous Velcro.
You remember, it was patented and studied because someone asked themselves why socks, going to the fields, they attach a certain type of seeds of some plants.
Velcro in space is used everywhere to attack and close.
Even the suits that go to the Moon have pieces of Velcro to be able to quickly make closures.
But nature on this, he's done much more, hasn't he?
[Nicola] Velcro is extremely interesting.
The main problem with Velcro is that you can stick one element on the other, that is, I can hook the hooks to the micro-rings that are there.
In nature, clearly, something much more sophisticated was needed.
The most sophisticated animal ever, from this point of view, because the largest, has necessarily had to evolve with the absolute best adhesive mechanisms: it is the gecko, which actually has, inside its paw, a number, we have also counted them, billions of elements in grip, of two-dimensional structures, each of which exerts a small force that together make a very remarkable adhesive resistance of the gecko.
Just to give an idea, an ideal suction cup lasts five times.
He also manages to control this adhesion; this is perhaps the most intriguing aspect.
He manages to break away with extreme ease, using a little bit the concept that we use regularly when we want not to hurt ourselves by detaching a patch, that is, changing the angle in which he removes the hair from the surface.
You might think of gecko-inspired surfaces to move a bit where we want.
[Roberto] We must also explain it to the man-spider who perhaps must become a gean-man to go into space.
Well, there is a problem however of duration and exposure to radiation and the difficulties of deep vacuum to heat and cold and also on this nature has given us extraordinary indications.
Both the yeast of the beer, both the lichens, the streptococci, and some complex structures such as plankton, and the tardigrades, very small animals, but still complex, were put in space, exposed to radiation, vacuum, temperature change, went into a form of hibernation and then were awakened after 10, 15, 20 months, finding that some of these individuals are still alive.
It is amazing what nature has done, because it has never been exposed to these conditions, but nevertheless, some of these animals on Earth have had the chance to develop these characteristics.
But there is a challenge that is absolutely impossible to overcome: the duration of a space trip!
Mars 6.8 months, but the first star 100,000 years with current launch and travel techniques.
How can we think of going on such a long journey?
[Nicola] Well, here we can also hope to take inspiration but the challenge is very strong.
But it is worth mentioning is the only organism that is known to be immortal.
A jellyfish that is so called, immortal jellyfish, which has the ability even to rejuvenate, that is, to return to the state of the octopus in particularly adverse conditions.
So basically it's as if a man in extreme conditions decides to come back as a child and then replay life when the extreme conditions, too adverse, have appeared.
It is certainly a very interesting and also difficult to mimic peculiarity.
[Roberto] Now I understand why some sci-fi movies show polyposes arriving with spaceships evidently are already informed of this possibility.
In any case, it is clear that interplanetary travel, possibly tomorrow when we have more effective ways to move, the interstellar one, requires very different technologies that we are not used to and that nature, as you have seen, could give us very interesting stimuli and challenges.
We'll probably need new technology tomorrow.
That’s why the challenge of going to Mars is so interesting to improve the whole of man’s technical abilities.
[Nicola] We can't end up like this: when will we go to Mars?
[Roberto] Ah, I don’t know, but I’m sure that the man and the woman who will go there are already born.
Thank you.
[Applause]
I work in the digital economy in Europe and Italy, and I was lucky enough to spend part of my career in companies that had their headquarters in California.
I have been active for several years as an angel investor, that is, an investor in start-ups.
For me 2017 was a year with some satisfaction for my work: I received two awards for my business angel business, one in Italy and one in Europe; in the past two years I have been among the "inspiring 50", the 50 most inspirational women in the world of technology in Europe.
I should be over the moon.
But I'm not.
For me, 2017 has been a year of defeat for women in the world of technology.
Defeats that hurt us, because they come from the same place from which innovation and the future come; a place that is taken as a model and a place where everything that happens has an echo that spreads all over the world.
I'm talking about Silicon Valley.
In 2017 episodes and behaviors began to come to light that are puzzling both in themselves and because of the omertà with which they were previously hidden.
In February 2017 Susan Fowler, recounting her experience as a developer subject to unwanted and rejected sexual attention in a team of Uber engineers, sets in motion a chain of events that on June 20 leads to the resignation of the CEO, Travis Kalanick.
On June 13, at an internal meeting at Uber, the businesswoman Arianna Huffington, who serves on the company's board of directors, talks about her desire to co-opt more women on the board.
David Bonderman, his colleague, interrupts her with a sexist joke: "More women, equal more chatter," he says.
The reaction leads Bonderman to have to resign from office on Uber's board.
On June 30, The New York Times published a report in which more than two dozen aspiring female entrepreneurs, including Rachel Renock, reported episodes of sexism during their interactions with venture capital funds to which they proposed to invest in their companies.
In July, Dave McClure, founder of the incubator "500 startups", who resigned after admitting improper behavior towards entrepreneurs seeking funding, collaborators and candidates.
Including Sara Kunst, who had told her story to The New York Times.
In August, an internal memo written by a Google employee, James Damore, appears in public, criticizing diversity initiatives in the company, arguing that women are biologically unfit to do the work of a programmer.
On August 7, Google splits the working relationship with him; quickly, he becomes the spokesman for a misogynistic, alt-right current of thought in Silicon Valley.
In years past, there have been some wonderful things from California: cultural exports like James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, the Beach Boys, the beat generation, the hippy culture, the black panthers, the California punk music, Ronald Reagan, Blade Runner, the Mac, Indiana Jones, the iPhone.
This year we only got the poison between men and women.
So much poison.
I'll take a step back in the early 90's.
At that time, as a recent graduate I started my career in a multinational strategic consulting company, in Milan.
I didn't have many female role models, indeed we can say that I had only one: this is Marisa Bellisario, who graduated in economics in the early 90's.
She works as a programmer on the first mainframes of Olivetti, then makes a commercial career in Olivetti, General Electric.
In 1981 she became managing director of Italtel: a huge company in deep crisis, of which, in a few years, she completed the turn around.
Conquer the covers of the world magazines, stands out for the hairstyles, the clothing, it is known that it would have reached further career goals if it had not been for the veto placed by some men of power.
In 1988 he died at the age of 53 from a bone cancer.
So I started my career with just one female manager role model.
And she wasn't even alive anymore, she was already dead.
Some time ago I got the curiosity to go and see what, today, the people who started their careers with me in that same place, in that same year.
The men are chief executive, more than half; general manager; managing director; senior partner; managing partner; chief strategy officer.
Women, no.
Women do, with some important and bright exceptions, other things.
They've taken other paths.
I took my own, on the street: I work as an independent counselor and as a business angel, as I told you.
I have held, in my career, roles of responsibility, I have had a lot of satisfaction.
Today I am an independent, a freelancer: I am invited to speak in public on the issues of the digital economy, startups, innovation; and even to testify about the success of women professionals managers, and to talk about my work, in particular, in Italy and abroad.
But I don't have a top chair.
I have, yes, important responsibilities: but I do not arm any power, except shared and collegiate within the councils of which I am a part.
I'm an independent, a freelancer.
And so are most of the colleagues I met in my journey.
So what happened to my generation of women?
What prevented them from achieving the career goals they set themselves in the early 1990s, and what can we do so that what happened to us, whatever it is, does not happen to those who come after us?
So that other women can achieve their goals without crashing into a wall?
And what are the costs of this state of affairs?
It is well known that the world economy, the welfare of all of us, pays a cost in terms of non-growth due to the absence of women from decision-making processes from the world of work; according to the OECD we are losing two and a half points of growth, over the next eight years, due to the gap in participation.
If we halved it, the world would grow more.
In companies, the lack of diversity in management, correlated with a lower degree of innovation than that found in companies where at least 20% of top managers are women.
But these economic arguments are well-known and strange, and they don't push for change.
Instead, I would like to give you some data on the human costs of the situation in which we are and these costs concern not only women but also men, these men to whom, in the vast majority of cases, we entrust the roles of power in companies, while women entrust other tasks.
We have concrete evidence, for example, of how decoupling masculinity from the role of head of the household, or income dealer, could have important benefits for women and men.
An American study shows us that if the incomes in the couple are wide-brought, over time, in favor of man, the physical and psychological health of the man is more likely to deteriorate: anxiety states and depression increase.
And the effect is even stronger if man remains the only one, of the two, to bring income.
A longitudinal study of 72,000 Swedish men showed that decades after the birth of a child, men who used parental leave for a period of one or two months survived more than their colleagues who did not, at the same age, education, employment level.
The mortality rate of men who took care of their young children was 24 percent lower than that of those who did not.
The experience of caring for newborns seems to have, in fathers, an effect of preventing risky behaviors, especially alcoholism; and it is an effect that lasts for decades to come.
So, what favors equality at work and at home?
Equality of economic opportunities and care tasks?
Unfortunately there is no silver bullet, we can only make some considerations.
A study of 6,000 Danish companies with a man chief executive showed that when a firstborn daughter is born, the pay gap in the company decreases because women's wages rise faster than those of men.
This does not occur if the firstborn is a son.
A U.S. study suggests that venture capital funds whose partners have daughters, hire more women.
[And] they not only hire more women, but they also perform better.
It is clear that requiring that those who exercise power in companies have female daughters is not a policy lever unfortunately actionable; we cannot force the top managers to reproduce or generate these strange beings of a different sex than their own.
Perhaps as a suggestion to the girls at their first job, before sending that resume it is worth taking a look at the family composition of who sits in the button room.
What does all this mean?
That gender stereotypes, which are there and are in the public eye, don't just hurt women.
Stereotypes are cages: a somewhat wider and more comfortable and comfortable cage for men, a narrower, more limiting cage for women and an even narrower one for transgender, intersex and binary people.
So stereotypes really hurt everyone.
They hurt us women who accept to be seen as the queens of multitasking and to leave much of the power, too, to men.
As a result we still suffer a wage gap, we make fewer careers, we accumulate less wealth and less savings, we are less autonomous.
And the prejudice against us seems to be alive in the millennial generation as much as in that of their parents.
But stereotypes also hurt men, because masculinity can become a trap.
Since childhood we socialize males as incomplete children who can express a limited range of emotions.
If a little girl wants to play football, or loves cars, by now we've realized it's okay, we let her do a little tomboy.
But if a child loves classical dance, we still treat him like Billy Elliot in the 1980s.
We grow, therefore, these male children also in their cage of masculinity stereotypes.
We send them to school, then they go to work and we expect them to be the economic engine of the family.
With their baggage of stereotypes, and with ours.
When a woman leaves work outside the home to devote herself to her children, which tragically happens much more than she should, she has all our solidarity.
Let's say: look at what a good mom, look at that heroine, what sacrifices she made to raise her children.
In the few cases where, on the other hand, it is a man who makes this decision, to stay at home with his children, perhaps because the woman earns better than him, we punish him by perceiving him as weak and inadequate.
This double standard is very dangerous.
The stereotype hurts everyone: women, men and all of society.
My feeling is that elsewhere women are moving a little faster than from us in the West.
For example, in China, coming out of the stereotype, 55 percent of digital startups are founded by women.
How many are here?
And women in China are partners in 80% of venture capital funds.
They decide in which initiative to invest.
They are on the march, they move, they go forward: we here, in the West, have the feeling of standing still, or almost millimeter-longly advancing and, every now and then, going back.
Because even in very innovative environments, where the future is produced, it is as if women and men in the world of work were separated by a large canyon.
And from this canyon came the summer of poisons, which I told you about earlier.
There's an air of defeat, there's a lot of bitterness for trying to win without having taken into account that the dice were rigged.
It is enough to make me want to give up dialogue, to return among the like, to lock ourselves among those who understand us, to cut the bridges.
But I am convinced that, more than ever, it is time to build bridges: build bridges between women and men to be able to meet halfway and shake hands.
Make an effort together: Now is the time to challenge the canyon that divides women and men.
What does it mean in practice?
I would not like to repeat to you the recipes already known, such as the need, for companies, to activate a different organization of work; or as the voluntary effort of let us go ahead, of lean-in, which is largely always at the expense of women.
Today I have three new recipes for you that all have to do with building bridges: a personal one, a media and a policy.
The first is personal: hygiene, in the work environment, is your responsibility.
I speak of the hygiene of behaviors: if you are a man, you must know that a thousand things happen at work every day: interruptions, jokes, comments, words said in half a voice, ideas generated by one person and attributed to another, which to a woman make the effect of a thousand cuts in the skin made with the edge of a sheet of paper.
And of which you men often don't even notice.
Sit down with a woman and ask her, if and when it happens, to point it out, discreetly but effectively, while it happens.
With a gesture, with a glance, with a signal agreed in advance.
Take, then, aside the men who interrupted, mocked, excluded or diminished a woman and explain to them that this, in 2017, is no longer acceptable.
If you are a woman, however, do not unnecessarily exhaust your energies by keeping your frustration inside, or trying to explain these things on your own.
Find a man-wing, build a bridge with him, and make him work there.
The second recipe is the media one: look with a critical eye at the role messages that surround us.
Your children's school textbooks are full of stereotypes, even today, in 2017.
Dad and moms, look at these lyrics.
Not just moms.
Talk to the teachers and have the most appropriate texts adopted in the times in which we live.
Television, advertising, are always part of the media environment around us.
And we are not just talking about the classic object woman, who must disappear from our screens without ifs and buts.
We are talking about those cages made of stereotypes that in 2018 will have to stop existing in the UK because the Authority for Standards in the World of Advertising has decided to put in place new anti-stereotype guidelines.
Advertising can be sanctioned, for example, in which the whole family puts in disorder and only the mother puts in order; those in which there is a typical activity of the girls as not suitable for children, or vice versa; those in which a man is mocked because he tries unnecessarily, and without succeeding, to perform the care tasks of the home or the family.
Do we also want ads without these stereotypes?
Well, let's make our voice heard, women and men.
This includes creatives in agencies, advertising campaign clients, decision-makers within companies and all of us consumers.
The third recipe is the political one: there is a great taboo that we must eradicate in Italy and that is what parental leave must be reserved for women.
True, whenever you try to give men an extra day of 100% paid paternity leave, the public coffers cry; but habits do not change by giving away days with the dropper.
Habits are changing around the world: in companies like facebook, which all its employees offer, when they become fathers, up to 4 months of paternity leave; or Spotify, which offers 6.
But outside of the big successful companies that can afford to have such equal policies, what can we do?
We have a great resource, in Italy: after compulsory leave, optional parental leave: today it is six months, paid only partially and available only to the mother.
It is politically possible, if we make an alliance between men and women, to institute optional bipartisan leave: three months for one parent, three months for the other, without being able to be exchanged or discontinued.
In this way women would return to work first, great benefit; fathers would find themselves learning the work of care and perhaps, like the Swedes, living longer; and third, the whole of society would work better.
In an ideal world, men and women with a new baby would be at home for the same time.
No one in the company would ever be denied an assignment, a project, a promotion, a pay rise because they could have a baby.
We can no longer afford, men and women, not to be feminists.
Building bridges is the only way to unravel the world we live in.
With the three recipes I told you about today, we could go a long way.
That's why I leave you with the words of a man who speaks as a feminist.
Thank you.
(Applause) [English: It's crucial that everyone understands] [that men can't just,] [but should be feminists.]
[And I'm proud to be so] [To be a feminist, to me, means to recognize] [what men and women should, can, must have equal rights.]
[And second, that there is still an enormous amount of work to be done.]
[He for She is a movement promoted by the United Nations,] [to which I hope you all join,] [of men in defense of women.]
[Of men who close in on those offensive conversations] [who are born in the locker room, and in a camaraderie culture].
[We need to know we can be better than that!]
[The way we treat our sisters, girlfriends,] [cousins, mothers, and the world around us,] [counts!]
[We must rediscover the true sense of manhood] [which is openness, respect, compassion] [and the courage to defend all this!]
(Applause)
Holy Father, I started writing to you two years ago.
A morning of advanced spring, in a village of the Langhe, with the cobblestone streets that spiral up to the square.
On the square a castle and a church as old as there are many, in Piedmont.
From that square, the valley opens to perdifiato, at the bottom, the hills covered with woods: chestnuts and hazelnuts, below, the vineyards and the cornfields.
The beauty of the Langhe, there the extraordinary beauty of the landscape coexists with the horror of certain families, my: bourgeois, in the indifference of many.
Holy Father, my name is Geneva, I am 40 years old, I am originally from Turin I grew up there and I attended high school.
After I met the man who would become my husband, it was autumn.
It came from the Langhe, Cuneo, a young slender, with beautiful manners.
He had just enrolled in Medicine in Turin, Corso Massimo d'Azeglio.
That day the mists of the Po went up in the park, the air was getting drunk, we looked at each other and we were happy.
A dream left in the blood.
He graduated, specialized, married, a lavish marriage.
I moved to his country.
First child: Matthew, gift of God.
Then Peter and Luke, the twins.
Peter is the stone on which Jesus founds his Church, Luke is the light, the favorite of Our Lady, St. Luke is the patron saint of doctors.
Francisca: green eyes and blonde curls, elusive detachment... it looks like me.
My children are beautiful.
They have that healthy color of those who live in the countryside.
At the foot of the Langhe, at the confluence of two rivers, 300 meters above sea level.
Once, stop for travelers and pilgrims on the ancient salt road that connected Albenga to Alba.
We live in a big farmhouse, during the day, children play barefoot in the grass and jump with joy, at night they sing the crickets.
Andrea is the heir of a rich family, masters of a palace in the city and a beautiful villa by the sea in San Remo.
His family is known in our village, he makes many donations to the church, and on Sundays he always shows up at Mass in the wooden bench in the front row with the family name written on it.
As a young man he took the time to travel, but instead of marrying a village girl, a girl accustomed to country life, he chose me.
Turin, a foreigner in Cuneo, thin and blonde like certain others he had met in the world.
Unfortunately, our beautiful story ends here.
My husband does not have the moral virtues of King Arthur, when he returned to live in the country he changed.
It will be the peasant culture, macho, it will be the friends at the bar, for them the women do not count, they are made to serve them.
The fact is that Andrea has become violent he has been beating me for twelve years, now he also uses violence on children.
In the surroundings there is no Lancelot able to save us, ours is not a degraded situation, like certain suburbs: anything but.
Andrea is primary, he earns well.
Of course, with me he is not generous: he gives me a few euros at the time, in the evening he claims the receipts of the grocer, from the butcher passes him at the end of the month, but, after all, the money is there.
The other night Andrea kicked me, I was too tired, I couldn't resist the pain, I shouted.
The little girl woke up jumping into the stairs and saw me on the ground while the father was hitting me.
The next morning, at school, she burst into tears, the teacher hugged her, she told herself everything, she was surprised: she knew Andrea forever.
Never thought he was violent.
But children don't lie.
The teacher summoned me, she said she would speak to him.
I begged her not to, we risk being killed, me and the baby.
For now, I can't feel like rebelling, I can't leave this beautiful house, to move with my four children to a small apartment.
And then my husband is Catholic, he doesn't want to part.
My parents are Catholics, too, practising.
They live in the city, I don't see them often.
My mother sensed something, but I don't want to sadden her with my problems, I already know that a divorced daughter wouldn't like her.
Actually I don't want to leave Andrea, I don't want to go to the Carabinieri, as a friend, a high school friend, the only one I feel every now and then, advises me.
It would be like cheating on him.
Maybe I'm wrong something, it all seems so strange.
When I met him, Andrea was kind, he is even now: he fills me with beating, then hugs me, says he loves me.
It happens often.
If they bleed, of course he does the dressing, he doesn't want to go to the ER, everyone knows him.
Often the family, instead of being the image of love, becomes a place of quiet cruelty.
The other day I went home, I found myself in front of Andrea's mother as a young man was handy, beating her husband, the children, in the house she does not speak Italian, she uses the dialect.
In that scabro language, a few nights ago he urged Andrea to beat me.
Then it was she, my mother-in-law, who sent me away, away from home, the children looked, astonished.
Maybe it's because here oxen and people are a whole race, I'm from Turin, I'm from a good family, bourgeois.
She would have preferred a girl here, those who are in the house and say nothing.
On Sunday I went to confession, Don Paolo says I must have patience, endure.
The people experienced by the greatest sufferings are preferred by God, Jesus said.
I don't have to complain, the family is sacred, you can't dismember.
Of course it is difficult to stick together, if you are not all respectful of each other, but here at stake there is not only respect, there is violence, violence severs love.
After beating me, Andrea goes to confession, repents and the priest grants him forgiveness.
Then he falls back in, he goes back to beat me and Don Paolo still forgives him.
He's a country priest, my mother-in-law brings him chickens and rabbits, stories from before.
Andrea means "man."
Holy Father, in the Mass of the beginning pontificate, you said that every man must be guardian of himself and of others.
Andrea was watching the Mass, on TV, then a pretext was enough to beat me again, in front of the children: it became normal, even for me.
I remain silent, staring upside my man.
I've had four children, but here women are like then: they make babies, and they don't count for anything.
I'm full of bruises, hiding the cheekbone wound with a little trick I have to do something for them, for my children, the eldest started raising his hands.
Holy Father, I heard you on the radio, while you were talking about the first believers, I would like to ask you for help.
Perhaps a word of his would be enough to put an end to so much violence, violence disguised as love, I have heard.
But maybe it wouldn't serve.
What can be said that has not already been said?
Unless you, Holy Father, decide to speak to priests, to those like Don Paolo, so that they do not so easily grant forgiveness to men like my husband.
The Church forgives, where she feels sincere repentance because a repentance only formal serves to return to the sacraments but also to the usual violence.
You have to show repentance, try to correct yourself.
Before fiction, the priest cannot, and must not acquit.
Holy Father, I already wrote to you a couple of years ago but you had just ascended to the papal throne, it was the wrong time.
You already know, my name is Geneva, I'm Piedmontese like your grandfather Giovanni and your great-grandfather Francesco.
I live in Turin, beautiful, ancient, when in the evening it becomes a star in front of a large choir of people.
Turin means Naples that goes to the mountains, Turin: straight streets, is the other side of Rome itself, Turin, a city sick with melancholy, so the Venditti sings it.
We live in an apartment building in Corso Francia, a straight line: it starts from Piazza Statuto, Porta Susa and takes to France, to Chambéry.
Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy in 1711 had wanted it, connecting Palazzo Reale with the residence of Rivoli.
During the Second World War, when Italy entered the war against France, the city authorities changed their name, in progress Gabriele D'Annunzio.
After the war it returns to be Corso Francia Today below passes the subway: nine stops.
At the beginning of Corso Francia there are many beautiful villas, Liberty style, early 20th century.
We live a little further, towards Rivoli, the outskirts of Turin.
Employees live in my apartment building.
Early in the morning they run to work.
The one I live in is not my home.
It's the house I grew up in, my parents'.
They are elderly, they left me their furnished apartment and moved to the countryside.
Now, leave you tell yourself how I found the courage to go to the Carabinieri and denounce Andrea.
That's why I didn't want to.
Francesca was in fourth grade when her father kicked me on the carpet.
The next morning, he told the teacher everything.
Worried, the teacher wanted to go to Andrea's, to talk to him.
It wasn't good for the little girl to tell those things around.
I begged her not to say anything, she would beat us, me and the baby.
I had made my decision.
For Francesca.
Today it's in sixth grade.
After talking to the teacher I went to the Carabinieri and to the Emergency Room.
They ascertained the bruises, it had not been the worst time, I had been beaten much worse.
But it was enough to press charges.
A few weeks later I went to a law firm, in Turin I relied on a lawyer for the criminal case, another for the civil case.
I didn't ask for state patronage, I wanted a trusted person.
I spent everything I had in lawyers.
A huge sacrifice.
Now Andrea passes me 500 euros a month for each of our children.
He should have given me more, he's rich, but the properties are in the name of his mother.
He doesn't care if the kids don't have the same opportunities as before.
He doesn't care about the sacrifices I make to pay for the English course, violin.
The boys have changed their lives, they give up so many things, they attend public school, yet they don't complain.
They never said they wanted to go back to the country, to their father.
They don't regret that old farmhouse, with vaulted ceilings, frescoed, the terrace, those beautiful arches.
I work part-time, secretary, in a museum, 900 euros a month.
In short, the expenses are many, even if I pay my only 500 euros of rent, a symbolic amount, they are retired teachers, some health problems, if they get by, but I can not expect more.
They already do a lot, and they don't have great availability anyway.
They are Catholics, practitioners, and after the many reservations they finally accepted that I left my husband and asked for separation.
And to think that two years ago they told me to be patient, to turn the other cheek.
My brothers, on the other hand, just can't accept my choice.
They live outside Turin, I rarely see them.
I know that the time at my disposal is coming to an end, Holy Father, Let me tell you the reactions of Andrea and his family: when I left there was very bad.
Now he does the part of the gentleman betrayed in honor, and I pass for crazy.
The week is in white coats at the Emergency Room, the Saturday volunteer at the Green Cross and every now and then with the elderly.
Sunday in the church.
I'm the one who made it all up.
He sued me.
Five open lawsuits in court.
To have taken it worse is my mother-in-law: a proud, wounded in pride, thought that omertà would protect everyone.
For her I am a witch, to be sent to the asylum: she does not understand how she could raise her head, give up my life as a lady to live in an unrenovated suburban apartment.
I just gave the white, it all held.
A few clothes, of jewelry I didn't have any, he never gave me any.
The pearl round?
Gift of my mother for eighteen years, in Piedmont uses like this.
In the village I have not returned, it is the territory of Andrea.
In that house I can't even enter to take my things I left in a hurry, two years ago, it was June, the schools were about to end, I just had time to collect the report cards.
One night Andrea was on guard duty in the hospital.
I took the children and we left, in Turin, 80km on the old car that Andrea had returned, a few months later through lawyers.
We left no friends in the country, neither I nor the boys: they were isolated, the father never wanted anyone around the house.
It wasn't easy, but I did it, we did it.
Holy Father, I'm not asking for anything, I just wanted to tell you how it went, that's all.
In Church?
I go there, every Sunday, I bring my children They were used to that beautiful ancient church: after the Mass, while the bells were ringing in celebration, we went out on the square, the gaze on the Langhe.
Now we go to the neighborhood parish, in Corso Francia.
It's not the same thing, but it's okay.
I spoke to a priest about these events, I met him by chance, on the train he left a mark.
His name was Father Carlo Caroglio, he said that it is not necessary to suffer violence, he was a city priest, modern, originally from Alexandria, he had lived for a long time in Novara, before becoming a priest he had studied as a chemical expert, as you did.
Don Carlo was different from the priest of the country, the one who says to Andrea again: "You don't have to feel guilty if your wife left you, a wife who abandons you doesn't love you, it's her who has to be ashamed, she's not worthy of you."
Andrea beat me, then went to the priest, said he was repentant, and the priest absolved him.
For this reason, Andrea feels on the side of the right.
Your Holiness I have nothing more to tell you, there's no more time.
I trust in your goodness and understanding.
I ask you only one thing: make sure that priests do not always absolve violent men.
My heartfelt regards, Geneva.
(Applause)
I'll tell you a story.
A few weeks ago, I accompanied my daughter, 10, named Ilaria, to school.
But I wasn't dressed like that, so I didn't have a shirt and jacket.
My daughter, with the curiosity typical of 10-year-old girls, makes me: papi, you don't go to work today.
I do them: no, today I actually work from home.
She looks at me and says, well, you probably won't have anything important to do.
(Laughter) And this thing made me think a little.
It made me think how much, in reality, we ourselves contribute to creating, in our children, prejudices.
Because I will tell you that, in fact, according to my view, work is not a place where you go.
Work is changing, it is changing profoundly.
I will tell you some things that go to support this thesis of mine.
It is changing because there are increasingly rare skills, but increasingly in demand by the market and companies.
A BCG study has certified that about 30 percent of high-tech positions will be vacant over the next 18-24 months for lack of skills.
You imagine: 30 percent of the positions will remain uncovered due to lack of skills, especially in the world of data science and machine learning, so the most modern, most advanced skills.
So, from this point of view, we're a little bit struggling to build the skills we want to see in our organizations of the future.
We're chasing them.
Another interesting fact is that about 66 percent of companies’ ICOs, the IT infrastructure managers of companies, say that talent scarcity is approaching crisis size, so it’s becoming a very strong issue.
Another very important element: artificial intelligence and automation and robotization are changing the world of work.
The same study of BCG, which I invite you to go and read, is called: "12 forces that are changing the way organizations work" has certified that, from now to the next 10 years, 70 percent of the professions that we do today will be changed drastically or even disappear.
And, if we look at what the World Economic Forum says, two-thirds of the children who study in primary school today are preparing for jobs that don’t exist yet.
Impressive, if I think about my children who are attending elementary school today.
Another theme: the average life of some skills, some engineering skills, has dropped drastically and today is between two and a half years and five years.
What does that mean?
That if a person does not set out to invest in himself and play the game of continuous learning will be, in a short time, little "employable", little employable.
But there are also some somewhat softer forces that are changing the world of work.
For example, having a strong culture within the organization.
The fact that about 90 percent of companies consider culture a distinctive and competitive factor for the organization’s success is definitely something very significant, very important.
And from that point of view, there is correspondence.
Because even the people who live the organizations are putting the culture and sense of purpose at the center of their path.
62 percent of millennials don't want a job, they don't want a salary, they don't want an office job.
He wants to have a career that has a strong social impact.
And, this is my opinion, it's probably not just millennials who want a trade, a career that helps them have a strong social impact.
Another soft force that is changing the world of work is the increasing focus on the world, the theme of diversity and inclusion.
In the United States, 80 percent of people employed in organizations say it is a factor in choosing their position and the company that organizations focus on diversity.
And 72 percent of the same people say they’re willing to leave the organization they work for for an organization that’s more inclusive and more attentive to the subject of diversity.
So, it's becoming an element of talent attraction.
It's becoming such a strong issue that McKinsey has done a study that showed that there's a 15 percent higher chance for companies that seriously invest in diversity and inclusion, to achieve financial success.
So, it's not just something nice, nice to work on.
It is a differential factor for the economic results of the organization.
Finally, work, and this is probably the center of reasoning, is increasingly fluid and flexible.
There are - there is the explosion of co-working spaces.
In Italy we have some beautiful success stories on this issue.
Smart working has become a topic at the heart of business strategies.
The Observatory on smart working of the Politecnico di Milano argues that by now most of the companies in Milan have adopted smart working strategies.
And then there is another theme, just as important: skills are being formed in places where, until a few years ago, it was unthinkable to see them.
Let’s think about how many graduates there are who are coming out of the computer engineering pathway in India or China.
And that's forcing organizations to rethink their strategies.
If, until yesterday, organizations put an office where it made sense to put it and then attracted talent, today the same organizations are questioning themselves, they are wondering if really this strategy is the right one.
And they’re putting their venues where the talent is.
The explosion of jobs, especially with technological content, in India is very strong in recent years.
The work is increasingly fluid and flexible: it is increasingly normal, increasingly common to see a work team where the boss is based in Washington and the five members of his staff are based in Caracas, Madrid, Greece, Shanghai or Sydney, maybe on 5-6 different timezones.
So, from this point of view, do you still need the office?
I have my doubts.
I have my doubts because, as I told you, in a world of work that is changing in a very strong way, in which skills are increasingly scarce, the war for talent is increasingly strong, the world in which artificial intelligence, automation are changing the way in which organizations work, in a world where the issues of the sense of purpose and diversity of inclusion are not always returning to the center, in a way that is more and more flexible, in a way that is not a strong way, in a way that is more flexible, in a way that is a company
And so, here, my idea, very simple, very clear: to help our children overcome prejudices, to question them.
And to remove them, if they have any.
Because the world of work is changing, the world of work will be characterized by an activity that is always done with more and more passion, more and more with more sense, more and more desire to put at the center that theme of continuous learning that I have tried to represent.
And then our purpose is this: to talk to our children about this issue, to talk about how, from a practical point of view, work cannot be a physical space, it cannot be the office.
We don't "go to work," even if we say it often.
We do, a job.
And so, my point is exactly that: work must necessarily be our story to our children.
Something you do, certainly not a place where you go.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon, good afternoon everyone.
I'm taking you to my world today.
I tell you about diversity in the world of blockchain.
But let’s take a step back: what is blockchain?
Blockchain is a new layer, level, of the Internet that has fundamental characteristics: it is open, incorruptible, unchanging, transparent and decentralized.
It is commonly called web 3.0.
If web 1.0 was the era in which companies communicated directly with users, and in fact there was a communication, let's call it, two-way: companies promoted, perhaps, their products on the Internet; and users bought directly on e-commerce; and the era of web 2.0, on the other hand, was the era in which users began to interact with each other, to exchange information and data on blogs, on social media, etc
We know that this technology will have an impact in many industries, not only in the world of finance; and we know that we must get there prepared.
We do not know when this will happen, but we know that we must not only arrive prepared in terms of products but also in terms of the workforce, in fact, which constitutes, builds this new world, this new technology.
For example, in my company we believe in this vision of the ‘tokenization’ of everything, in the so-called ‘tokenization of everything.’
That is, we think that any asset, any form of value, a tomorrow – whether it is a house, a machine, a precious metal, a luxury object, a work of art – can be transformed, digitized into a token that can then be exchanged on this blockchain, on this new technology.
To give you some examples, imagine the companies that work in the textile sector or in the food industry, which can thus control all the processes in the supply chain in key, for example, of anti-counterfeiting; or we think of art lovers, who can not afford to buy a painting, for example Andy Warhol, but can invest in a fraction of that work of art and can exchange this fraction, this token, with other fractions of works of art, always
But if we know that blockchain is a technology that will impact everyone’s daily life, through many products, the workforce that composes it must reflect this technology, it must know how to speak to everyone.
Today I will talk to you about diversity, so what I represent a little in my world.
And to tell you about it I looked for the definition: I wanted to arrive with a nice definition of diversity, in fact I found many, one different from the other, because we constantly hear about it in many keys.
It is related to sexual orientation, ethnicity, socio-economic background.
In my opinion, the best definition of diversity in a business key is the ability to create a workforce where everyone, whoever they are, feels first welcomed and feel that they are contributing to the construction of the future of this company.
Intuitively, we know that diversity is a positive factor: now there is also research that shows us, with data, in fact, that companies that implement, precisely, this characteristic, this factor, in all levels of their management, from the top management down, also have greater financial return.
And this suggests to us that it is not only about gender diversity, man or woman, but about all the diversity we have mentioned before.
But why does this happen?
Why are companies with the most diversity more success on the market?
Because they know how to listen more to what is happening out there, they develop a different sensitivity to understand what, in fact, consumers want.
At what point, however, now, in this historical moment, of diversity in the world of technology, of technical companies, which then concern my world, but not only?
We at Circle, my company, wanted to understand, indeed, the interest of women for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, more specifically, which are our field.
So we did a survey, in the United States, which is one of our markets, out of more than 3,000 people, in an age range of 24 to 74.
Guess what?
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies interest males, millennials, whites.
This is the state of play.
And the results we have obtained, crossed with other research, other surveys, are always the same: there is about a five percent, indicatively - think, only a five percent of women who make up the workforce of this field, who are founders of blockchain companies, investors, enthusiasts, engineers.
What I want to tell you today is that to work in the world of blockchain you don’t need to be a 20-year-old nerd, who stay all day in front of a computer and have a degree in engineering, they are passionate about finance, investment.
For example, think of me: today I will briefly tell you about my path, because I think it is no coincidence that I have looked for this type of innovation and technology.
I come from a completely different area.
I come from the world of the sharing economy, I studied neither engineering nor science: I studied economics, and then I did marketing.
For study, and for work, I lived a bit around the world, in the sense that I have always been, since I was a child, an "early adopter", I define myself so.
I was always the first who wanted to try something new, who wanted to find out what was the innovation that would later be successful, shortly after.
And I was lucky, because my first example - I grew up alone with my mom.
So my family was made up of me, my mom and my little dog.
And she always has me - instead of tying me up, holding me, she's always spurred me to try, do, go.
And so I did, in the sense that first, from the province - I grew up in the middle of the Piedmontese fog, I spent my first 19 years there - then from the province I went to Milan to study.
After three years of Milan - which was my dream, it seemed to me an unreachable thing - Milan was already mine, and it was time to continue on the next adventure.
And so I lived, for several reasons, study, work, in New York, London and Paris.
Think that when I was entering the world of work, the tech wave of startups was just coming to Europe.
And I immediately realized that I wanted to be part of that coveted there.
And although it was much riskier than working in the big multinationals already started, I wanted to do that thing there.
I wanted to find economic models that would impact the lives of millions of people, when people still didn't realize it.
And so I discovered there was a small, then, Californian company that was looking for the first people to open the European market: at the time there were 100 people in all, in the company.
So I sent my CV, and think, after two hours they answered me.
After a week I was hired.
And together with two other guys, we opened the Italian market of Uber.
At Uber I worked four years, it was an experience, for me, decisive and beautiful, sincerely.
After four years of the Italian market, I said: now I want to try another challenge.
Send me to India, I want to work in an emerging market that has a whole different scale than Italy, I want to see what happens there, how this technology moves there.
I arrive in India, I live in Mumbai a few months and there I hear, for the first time, talk about blockchain, which I honestly did not know before.
And I'm starting to get passionate.
So I understand, I feel it, I say: here we go again.
Now that the sharing economy is an established, successful model that is impacting all areas of the world, I want to stand out, I want to try again this new technology, this new innovation, in which no one yet believes.
And so I start looking for companies that operate mainly in this industry, and I come across my current one.
I tell you sincerely that I was a little hesitant, because I said: sure that I find myself a team of males passionate about technology who are sniffing all day in front of the computer.
And I have nothing to do with a bat in there.
They do the selection process, and in the selection process I fall in love, desperately, with my company and my colleagues.
First of all I cross my head, which is my myth; and then I cross many women who have key roles in the company, from the head of Europe of communication to the head of Europe of the legal world.
And therefore these two factors: the selection process, in which I feel absolutely welcomed and I understand that there is the right space for me; and in addition the innovation factor, I wanted to be among the first to try, to find that thing, surely pushes me to become part of this world.
But let’s take a step back: the world is made up of 50% women and 50 percent men.
And we know that technology - what is the ultimate goal of technology?
Solving everyone’s daily problems.
Consequently, it goes without saying that companies, even the workforce that creates these products, must reflect this gender mix.
I believe that companies, but not only, institutions, also play a key role in this.
Let’s start from institutions, from education: as there are courses for children related to the world of computer science, but not only: MBA, master’s degrees with classes, competitions dedicated to computer science, there should be, also, for the world of blockchain and technology.
I want to tell you about this episode, which is nice and, destiny it wants, it happened to me the other night while I was writing this speech, and then I said: I have to tell it.
There was in the background a television program, "The TV of the girls," and there was Amalia Ercoli Finzi, who I discovered to be the first Italian woman graduated in space engineering, who told one thing, for me, very simple and very interesting.
He said: the girls must give the Meccano and a doll.
But not because all the girls have to become engineers: it won't happen, that.
But if one of them wants to become an engineer, he must know that he can do it.
To tell you about this episode, I looked for the gender, the female declination of the word engineer.
And I found that there are words that do not involve female gender: for example, the word surgeon, the word engineer, the word mayor, think a little.
This is, let's say, the role that institutions have, for example with regard to education: insert dedicated courses, and give the children the opportunity to discover this world, to get closer from the start.
What is the role of companies?
Well, surely, to expose their female leadership: let's show them, these women.
Let's have them interviews, let's expose them to them in the media.
Let's show that behind the success of these companies are women, young people, who have traveled the whole world, who have impressive resumes.
And on the other hand, surely, the selection processes are transformed.
This, in my opinion, is a very interesting research that HP has done.
Think a woman is applying, application, a role if she feels 100 percent in line with that role; a man applies to a position if he feels 60 percent in line with that role.
Imagine, in my fintech sector, how difficult it is: we combine finance and technology, which are par excellence two sectors, two male areas.
How difficult it is to attract valid women candidates, who can potentially make careers, can be instrumental in writing the blank canvas of this technology.
And it also changes the approach to CV.
The CV no longer becomes the backbone of the selection process, but it is up to the human resource to identify what is the appetite, the talent of that person, looking at finding more, perhaps, in the "soft skills" than in the "hard skills."
Maybe it has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, or blockchain - as in my case, I had nothing to do with it.
Or maybe in his free time he is an investor, he is an investor in the world of cryptocurrencies, maybe he has already informed himself for his passion, for his interest.
So, this is what we, as companies, have to propose to do.
And we individuals?
What is our role?
Well, I brought you a little bit in my world today, I told you this reality that is made up of men, women.
Think that I have had five garments in all: three women and two men, one of which is black and homosexual.
And for me I am - I aspire to be like them: that is, I am not a source of inspiration, more.
What you can do, however, from tomorrow each of you must start to inquire: you do not have to do application, but start chewing the matter, start to understand what it is.
Maybe you find yourself passionate, maybe you start taking an active role and not simply receiving, passively, this revolution when this happens in the lives of all of us.
Because it will happen, and it will have an even bigger, even deeper impact than what the Internet has had, for 20 years now.
What I encourage everyone to do - if I were to tell a student who has just left university, but also to you, I would say: take a backpack, chase us into a T-shirt and go to Asia, where this world is already very much started.
Start going to events, aperitifs, meetups.
Start to understand what it is.
And do a bit like this little girl behind me, who throws herself, in total unconsciousness but also amused, on this new medium that she does not know, following her predisposition, precisely.
And enjoy this adventure.
And that's exactly what I encourage you to do, and in short, everyone.
To do it now, right now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
﻿He is Juan, he is an indigenous Kaqchikel living in Guatemala.
A Mayan indigenous, Kaqchikel.
And like the vast majority of indigenous Kaqchikels, they grow corn.
The Maya believe they are made of corn.
Their god, Huracán, of the Popol Vuh, which is their holy book, creates them right from corn paste.
So Juan, every year, before the dry season, sows corn.
Every year, he needs 500 dollars to buy the seeds, 600 dollars that are to buy the pesticides associated with those seeds, and 900 dollars to buy the fertilizers associated with those seeds.
They call it “complete technology package”, they sell it to you like that.
A technology package that includes seeds, pesticides and fertilizers for the price of 2,000 dollars.
Obviously, Juan doesn't have 2,000 dollars and he has to go to the bank to get them, these 2,000 dollars.
When he delivers, he will finally sell the corn and have to bring the money back to the bank, they will have already become 2,400.
The problem is that when it goes to sell corn, in Guatemala, between Guatemala and the United States there is a free trade agreement, so the goods produced in Guatemala and the United States circulate freely between these two countries.
So when Juan goes to sell corn, he has to compete with the corn produced in the United States, where it is produced like this.
Thanks to hyper-mechanized, industrialized agriculture, and large-scale crops, in the United States they manage to produce corn at an infinitely lower price than Juan produces.
The price at the quintal of corn has dropped so much that now Juan sells it at 10 dollars a quintal: it's 10 cents a kilo.
But the vintage went well, Juan managed to produce as many as 50 quintals of corn.
So it will earn 5,000 dollars, which when we take away the 2,400 it will have to return to the bank mean 2,600 dollars for the whole crop.
It means 220 dollars a month.
But Juan still keeps a part of that corn for himself, and then he also has a small vegetable garden and a few chickens.
Thanks to all this he manages to guarantee himself, his wife and his three children 1,700 kcal a day.
These 1,700 kcal a day, which for us could be a perfect low-calorie diet, to throw down the bacon in view of the summer, for Juan mean losing 1 kg a month, every month.
12 kg per year, every year.
It's called malnutrition.
In Guatemala, 22 families own 76% of the land.
9.5 million farmers share what is left.
The appreciations are so small that they can't produce who knows how much, and this makes Guatemala the tenth worst-fed country in the world.
2,244 kcal are the average, in Guatemala.
The average.
These include people in cities, include waste, waste, include the high fats that live in cities and include millions of farmers who do not get to those 2,000 fateful calories, and will never get there.
According to the World Bank, 49.8% of Guatemalan children under the age of five are malnourished.
According to this World Bank study, 72% of Guatemalan households last year had to sell assets to buy food.
Asset, this word used by the World Bank that to us may seem a tool of high finance, for a farmer, an asset means a hoe, a shovel, a plow.
It means selling work items to buy food.
So what does Juan do?
He sees a future, he sees something different.
He sees advertising signs advertising a crop that could guarantee him to make a lot more money, and it's sugar cane.
A U.S. company produces biodiesel in Guatemala.
They would lend him directly 3,000 dollars, so the debt is higher.
But that same company guarantees that he will buy him corn at the end of the year, at 6,000 dollars.
The gain, for Juan, increases from 220 to 250 dollars a month.
It looks like the business of the year.
Try it, Juan.
He throws himself on the sugar cane.
The problem is that then at the end of the year he no longer has corn, and what seemed like a perfect business turns out to be a fiasco.
And so, from 1,700 its calories drop to 1,600.
No more 12 kg per year, but 15.
He can't do it, he can't do it.
So what's he doing?
He decides to sell his piece of land to the same company that he will produce sugar cane on a large scale, and which will then sell biodiesel.
He sells his piece of land at about 7,000 dollars.
It's a good piece of land, for Guatemala, in a fertile area, in the plains.
He also sells his house, [it's] about 6,000 dollars what he makes from the house.
And then he goes into debt again for 10,000 dollars.
With these 23,000 dollars, he will pay a coyote, a human trafficker, who will take him and make him cross Mexico, on this train that across Latin America is known as “The Beast”: the train on which thousands of migrants travel, every day.
They leave, fleeing their countries to reach the United States.
Juan will travel in inhumane condition for a month.
Clinging, sometimes bound, for fear that if he falls asleep he falls downstairs.
So tied to this silo that carries exactly that biodiesel that was produced in its field.
Juan paid US$23,000 to be transported illegally from Guatemala to the United States.
Those 500,000 litres of biodiesel are transported for the price of 350 dollars.
Why do I tell you all this?
And why me?
Well, because I in Latin America, in Guatemala, I have lived there for a long time.
And stories like Juan's I've heard in the hundreds.
Then one day I told myself that someone had to tell it, that someone had to come here and tell those stories.
However, to do so, before I had to deprive myself of something, I had to take something off, I had to take away this shield that we all have, this protection that we have at birth, which is the most precious thing we have.
You will think, when one is born, a newborn child is said: “The important thing is health, the important thing is that he is well, the important thing is that he has money, that there is the sun, that he is in a beautiful place, that he has the love of the family”.
There is a much more important thing, something that is assigned to you randomly, the moment you are born.
Something that is not possible to touch, that is intangible, that we do not see, but that we all have.
And that's one of the most violent things ever invented: citizenship.
Citizenship represented by this stupid brown booklet, which we all have.
When you're born, they give you one, it's a bit like winning the lottery.
I won it, because on mine it says "Italian Republic".
With this I have access to the best education systems and the best health systems.
With this, I can go to 173 countries without having to apply for a visa.
There are people like me who, however, wrote “Republic of Syria” on this passport and do not go anywhere.
In 1853, the United States was to build the trans-Pacific railway, the one that runs, say, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
They had a problem, though: in the center of the United States, the Arizona area, they were all mountains.
And so they couldn't build the railroad, in short, it was complicated, it was a mess.
So what did they do?
They went from Mexico, which was on the bill, like today, and bought him a piece of land.
The sale of the Mesilla.
Of the lords, in Washington, they drew a straight line, so, in the middle of the desert, because they needed the plain to make the railway.
Today, through that straight line, the border passes.
There's a city, in that straight line, there in the middle of that straight line, which's called Nogales.
Nogales is split in two: if you are born there, you have a U.S. passport.
You have access to the best schools.
to the best hospitals.
You have a passport that allows you to go to 167 countries around the world.
If you're born here, you're Mexican, and you're not doing anything with your passport.
Did you think health was important?
Passport is important.
And the passport assigns it to you, perhaps, for a straight line drawn in Washington 160 years ago.
But I wanted to tell it, I wanted to live it like them.
And to do that, I had to undo this passport.
So I put it in an envelope, and I sent it to a friend's house.
I disguised myself, I turned into a Peruvian migrant from the Amazon named Aymar Blanco.
I crossed the Suchiate River, which divides Mexico from Guatemala, and then crossed all of Mexico.
Since 1994, Mexico has been working with the United States to block illegal immigration.
Every year, the United States pours between 4 and 6 billion dollars into Mexico to get Mexico to do the dirty work, i.e. block the Central and South American migrants.
So the border, by now, is no longer just the passage between Mexico and the United States.
The border is the whole of Mexico!
And Mexico doesn't end anymore, it's very long, it's huge.
Depending on where you pass, it can be more than 4,000 km.
Much of the journey is traveled clinging, wedged, sometimes tied like Juan to these freight trains.
Train that throughout America is known as “The Beast”, or the train of death.
Father Solalinde defined the train lines as “the largest open-air cemetery in the world.”
Every year thousands of people, maybe fall asleep, or get distracted, fall off the train and end up sucked under the rails.
This train is the emblem of the modern world: a train that travels, a huge train, freight, which does not perform passenger service, which travels non-stop from the south to the north carrying cheap materials, but without transporting people.
Coal, iron, zinc, copper, pieces of machines, pieces of clothes, finished clothes, mangoes, papayas, bananas.
Everything travels freely without tariffs, without borders, without anything.
The only things that are illegally travelling on that train are human beings.
They seized me three times during this trip.
A gang of hooded men, in the middle of the desert, after stealing everything from us emptied the water.
They didn't know what to do with it anymore, and they emptied it before our eyes, just to make us suffer thirst.
I had to run, run, jump off the running train over and over again, run faster than pregnant women and older gentlemen, so I could run away.
I had to plug my ears and my eyes, not to listen to the screams of those who had not made it.
According to Amnesty International, 60% of women, before reaching the United States, are raped during this trip.
60%.
The federal police took us, arrested us, locked us in a 4-meter-by-4-per-meter cell, in 40 people.
Two days, with 40 degrees of day, no water, no food, no bath.
40 people: we had to take turns, to sit.
Don't lie down, sit.
There was no chance of everyone sitting, we were doing shifts: a little sitting, a little standing.
For two days in a row.
Forced to eat, drink, shit, piss, vomit, pass out, all in this space.
In one stretch the train was not there, it had been taken away by rains, and back then there was a replacement service done with trucks.
And we walked 26 hours hidden in the double bottom of a truck.
When we finished, our joints were so hooked that when we got out of the truck we fell with our faces in the mud.
Our transporters laughed and drank tequila.
Nevertheless, driven by despair thousands of people make this trip every year and arrive at the border with the United States, and I with them.
The border with the United States could basically be divided into three.
You arrive, you have crossed all of Mexico but you still have to cross the border, you still have to get there in the longed-for United States.
The easternmost part is the only part where there is really a natural border, which is the Río Bravo, which by the way is a river with a funny name because in the United States it is called the Río Grande del Sur, the great river of the south.
In Mexico it is called the Río Bravo, the bad river.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people every year drown in an effort to cross it.
The current takes them overboard and then there the Gulf of Mexico currents make fun of them, and they take them to Texas, but dead.
The seven counties on the south coast of Texas have been in a health emergency since 2008 due to the amount of deaths you beach on their shores every day.
To the west, then, there is the wall: 1,223 km, the second largest separation barrier ever built by the human being.
In the 20 years of that wall there have already died, according to official U.S. estimates, 3,040 people.
To give you a term of comparison, in the 28 years of existence of the Berlin Wall the dead were 98.
Here we talk about 3,040, officers.
In Mexico, estimates speak of 15,000.
Then, in the middle, there's nothing, there's a gap.
What else do you have to add, in addition to the Sonoran desert, a desert a third large in Italy with temperatures that exceed 40 degrees by day and at night go to -10.
Pima County, just across the border, declared bankruptcy in 2013.
He could no longer pay the electricity bill, to keep refrigerators that kept 871 unidentified bodies of dead migrants in an attempt to cross the desert.
That's where I came by.
You walk at night, in the cold, you hide during the day, under an atrocious heat.
Groups of “American patriots”, U.S., poison the wells: one night we found a poisoned well, I was sick.
I owe my life to a Nicaraguan migrant whose name I don't even know.
While I was behind a vomiting cacti, he took me by the shoulder and said, “Oh, look they’re leaving you here.
You have to move.”
Not everyone has a Nicaraguan guardian angel.
We started in 24 and in Tucson we got there in 19.
Today, through that desert we want to expand, build yet another wall: a further barrier of separation between two countries, a further barrier that wants to prevent the human being from doing the most natural thing he can do: move, move.
We were monkeys 3.5 million years ago.
We got out of the trees to move.
We took the upright position, bipedal to be able to walk over long distances, to be able to move.
The history of the human being is made up of countless shifts, countless migrations and movements from one place to another, in search of food, in search of partners.
Then you come back, you run away from catastrophes.
The human being is moving.
Children learn to walk before they learn to really use their hands.
The children walk before they speak.
They learn to walk before eating solid foods.
The human being is made for walking.
And no wall, no barrier in the world, however great they can build it, no barrier to the world will ever prevent the human being from moving and moving.
Thank you.
(Applause) [The roots are important, in the life of a man, but we men have legs, not roots, and legs are made to go elsewhere - Pino Cacucci]
Today we talk about the future, about young people, about technology, but also about tradition, about know-how, about art, about beauty.
Today I take you to the factory, and I tell you about that extraordinary opportunity that is at the border between mechanics and digital.
It was the early 80's, and I remember when on Saturday morning I went to the workshop with Dad.
It was a mechanical workshop, indeed metalwork.
And they built very complicated details for the textile and aviation industry.
As we walked through the workshop, I remember a dark environment, a strong smell of oil, my father running right and left to give instructions to anyone he met.
I remember men with big, strong hands, busy, with their heads inside the machines, inside their dark suits.
I also remember a huge order and cleanliness – my father always kept a lot to order.
I remember very precise mechanical details: they looked like jewels, works of art: know-how.
Let’s take a leap forward, we are in 2017, we are in what is called today the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0.
It is a phase of history that is characterized by less defined and wider boundaries than the previous ones.
Let's retrace them together.
The first: 18th century, the introduction of steam power for the operation of production machines.
The second, early 20th century, electricity, chemistry, oil, mass production and assembly lines - Ford.
The third, early 1970s: electronics, computers, the first robots, automations in the factory.
This fourth is essentially characterized by a connection between the physical system and the digital system.
And it's very different from the previous ones for at least five reasons.
The first, the speed: while the first took about 80 years to reach full impact, the second 50, the third 30, the fourth is falling on us like a tsunami.
Multidimensionality, amplitude: it does not concern only individual technological dimensions, but many in acceleration and in combination with each other.
It’s not just about processes inside factories, it’s about more and more products, supply chains, business models – everything is interconnected.
Democratization: the cost of access to these technologies drops dramatically, so it is no longer reserved only for large companies but for an increasingly large audience.
Human capital is at the heart of this fourth revolution, much more than it was in the first three.
It is a cultural revolution, even before technological.
The mechanical sector, like everyone else, is not free from this great challenge and this great transformation.
Despite the great crisis that has hit the whole world, mechanics remains the pillar of Italian industry, an Italy that remains the second manufacturing country in Europe, and the fifth by added value in the world.
The mechanics alone realizes 48% of Italian exports and realizes 82% of the high and medium-high technology production.
We mechanics feel at the heart of this fourth transformation by observing a growing convergence between mechanics, digital and electronics.
Not only in processes, but more and more in products.
The product of this convergence is what we call mechatronics.
This convergence will lead to 26 billion connected objects in 2020.
Increasingly intelligent products, designed to simplify our lives, to make it safer, which once on the market learn, collect a huge amount of data, feel, react.
How do you do it, how does the way you do business change in this context?
We in the company make products to move and dose fluids with great precision and accuracy, and given this increasing complexity we started to ask ourselves this question several years ago.
In 2013 we created a completely separate place, a separate company, a knowledge company where designers and engineers work together on the future.
It is a group of people who are at the center of a network of excellence made up of universities, research centers, experts, technology partners.
Working openly, acting and working as innovation architects, combining technologies, people, knowledge.
This product is an example of the result of the work.
And it is a valve, a device to divert a flow, for use in the medical field – the extraordinary nature of this object lies in the fact that it was, entirely, not only designed but also tested on the computer, through hundreds and hundreds of repeated simulations, to which the task of identifying and sifting the highest possible number of configurations, geometries, was delegated to identify the best possible according to a function-objective.
The result was then achieved through 3D printing, it was combined with a shape memory actuator, an intelligent material that serves as a sensor and also as an actuator, then as an engine.
All of this is a connected product, part of those 26 billion objects that can hear, learn, react according to predefined rules.
These objects are then made in increasingly modern, connected factories, where the staff is overqualified, without gender barriers – no longer, designs and governs complex machines that make the same very precise mechanical details of which I have a memory as a boy – today, mechatronics.
But while all this is happening, while with great dedication and passion we ride this wave, let me go back a moment: it was 2015, it was a Sunday morning, at home, with my three children, then 11, 9 and 6 years old and I talked, as had happened other times, about the work of Dad, the factory, the mechanics, all this great transformation.
It wasn't the first time, but that time it weighed me particularly not to see in their eyes my own enthusiasm, and I began to wonder why.
This fascinating transformation that we live every day, this digital convergence, for our children, but [also] for families, for public opinion, they are distant, unknown.
There is a dramatic gap between reality and perceived.
Well, we in the industry have never been famous for our ability to tell: we prefer historically to do, to tell.
I realized, in front of the looks of my boys, that we were missing an important opportunity by watching as this gap grows.
Industry is the place where the most extraordinary transformations of our time are taking place.
And we have to be able to tell this, this, to our boys.
In a new way, with new words.
A sense of social responsibility started in me, towards my boys in the first place but towards young people, towards industry, towards the country, because I realized that we were playing so much.
So, as a good engineer, I decided to check this feeling with data.
Involved the association of industrialists, we carried out an analysis of the perceived from which it emerged, clearly, that the word metalworking, which still distinguishes our sector, were still associated words such as: iron; blue suits; mass production; assembly line; dirt; fatigue; oil.
It looked like an image from the movie “Modern Times” by Charlie Chaplin.
We're talking about the 1930s.
Companies, people who aim for the future, the protagonists of this transformation, are absolutely not associated with these words, if anything: technology; precision; electronic; digital; mechanical; future.
All these words, associated with the term “mechatronics”.
And so right from here we started with a project of repositioning the sector, to make it the first choice for our young people.
Promoting a cultural change, completely rethinking the way we tell ourselves.
And so we started by simply changing the name, from metalworkers to mechatronics, metalworkers for which we were always known.
And then we created an image, a new identity that should tell us in a simple way, talk to everyone.
Then we went to the schools, where we involved the young people with the competition “business director” to make this new world of factories tell through their eyes, through cinema.
We have involved the “Progress Advertising” foundation to tell this new change, including social, of work and the factory.
And then we went to the theater, to the Teatro Strehler in Milan where we told this change with the show “The Importance of Calling Yourself Mechatronics”, We told you about young people, about the future, but also about art and beauty.
Yes, because the products we make are beautiful, because they are generated by a way of design that has in beauty the indispensable quality of doing.
And then we brought this project, and we are bringing this project, on a national scale, because obviously this is not just a Milanese problem, or a Lombard problem.
But back to our young people, because it has been said that 65% of our children who enter elementary school today will do jobs that do not exist today.
And if we want the future that I told you today to be sustainable, we will have to be able to involve them, inspire them, bring these guys in.
Today, however, we start from a situation in which in Italy, [there is] 65% of difficulties in finding young people with training in technical-scientific disciplines.
On the other hand, though, we're told we have a 35 per cent youth unemployment.
It's paradoxical, we're talking about two worlds that don't speak to each other.
But why do our children, and our families, make choices, choose paths without perspective?
Are they aware of it?
Or they choose, they deliberately make mistakes because they see this world so far away, difficult, complex and for which they choose, they make only seemingly simpler choices.
Work is not stolen by robots, but by inadequate education.
On the one hand, the school model has not at all adapted to our times.
In this context, multidisciplinary and ability to move in complex scenarios are key; creativity and ability to solve problems are decisive.
And at school you see very little of this.
The school should make known and experiment with those most relevant technologies of our time: I’m talking about blockchain, programming, the Internet Of Things, Big Data, robotics, intelligent materials, Artificial Intelligence.
And I could go on.
And all this together, of course, art, literature, mathematics.
The school should be the laboratory of the future.
It should be a springboard to the future.
And then, training must be felt and experienced more and more also as an individual responsibility, of young and old, because today there are the tools and we can not always wait for someone else to solve the problem for us.
And we, entrepreneurs, must take responsibility for our role, must have the ability to convey the vision, opportunity and soul of this work.
We have to get out of business and we have to go to schools.
I do it as soon as I have the opportunity, and I assure you: I go out with the aim of inspiring young people and I come back inspired, because they are open, they are ready; it is up to us.
And this we must also do as informed, curious, aware parents.
And if I hadn't convinced you yet, come and visit our factories.
Come with your kids.
And come not only to the factories, but to all those places where the future is being planned: I'm talking about incubators, about business accelerators.
I'm talking about university labs, I'm talking about research centers.
Today Italy seems to have lost sight: our young people do not risk, they seem to have given up.
But I don't want to believe it.
Italy is a country with very deep industrial roots.
A fertile soil made of extraordinary brains, passion, tradition, creativity.
Of a capacity for combinatorial innovation that the whole world envies us.
Let's not throw all this away, letting our boys get lost by chasing paths without a future.
Nelson Mandela once said, “A winner is simply a dreamer who never gave up.”
And if we want to get our guys back to winning, we must first of all get back to inspiring them and making them dream.
(Applause)
Some of the most attentive viewers might sense that they are in this area.
Let's keep a low profile!
So, I'm a healthy bearer of optimism and I like challenges, in fact when they told me to choose where I wanted to talk about optimism, whether in Silicon Valley or Rovigo, Polesine, Italy, I had no doubts, because it can also be provocative to talk about optimism in this period.
In reality, what we believe to be this time is very important and the vision we have of the future is very important.
Why does the future have a lot to do with it?
The future has to do with it because it depends on how you see your future, because from that vision there spring the actions you do in the present, think for example when we choose a course of study: the first thing we think is: “Will it serve when I finish it?
Will it help me find a job?
Will it help me have a better life?” Then it is very important that we have the consciousness of what we are experiencing, if the phrase that “we live the best era in the history of humanity” is true, not of the last 50-100 years, of humanity.
I'm passionate about coaching, I know many coaches, but it was all invented by this here: Socrates was the only real coach, after us what do we do?
We make slides changing the things he said, but the reasoning is his and the pretension is simply to make people think.
Make people think to maybe have a different vision.
First of all, we clear the field of a possible misunderstanding: I don't have it with the pessimists.
Pessimists and optimists make their contribution to the world.
If for the optimists we had the plane for someone who dreamed of flying, the pessimists invented the parachute, it is essential that they entered it.
Then it's true that if you throw yourself in the parachute you have to be optimistic, because after... well, we don't get into a lap that doesn't end anymore.
What is our worldview?
If we look at the world as we have always seen it, maybe in a map, what is the idea we have of this world?
What eyes are we looking at him with?
Maybe someone here in the room, expert in cartography, geography, will know that this geographical map is not properly correct, reflects a bit the area where the first maps were built, in fact some continents do not have a dimension consistent with what they actually have in reality.
There is a map, it is called the map of Peters, which represents in a more faithful way what is the greatness of the individual continents.
In this map that you see behind me you can see Italy?
Even those in the lodge who paid little?
Can you see, even above?
Well, the ones who don't see zoom... what now?
Well, we need a few more seconds.
Did you find her?
Well there is Italy, it is just turned.
This map is backwards, but in reality this map is the map that Australia's primary pupils have in school books.
So, who's up with their legs up?
The kangaroos or us?
Neither they nor us, but it's the different view.
If we break a little out of our usual way of seeing things, perhaps we can grasp some aspects that might escape us.
We are living in a revolution.
If it is true that there have been many revolutions in the world, the industrial revolution, think of the first industrial revolution: the end of the seventeenth century, the steam engine, the chassis, which completely changed not only the production processes but also the interpersonal relationships, the very structure of society.
Two centuries after another revolution, called the second industrial revolution with the advent of the assembly line, with an extended use of electricity, which changed further, creating trauma, creating fractures and then subsequent well-being.
Think of the third industrial revolution that we have experienced I believe practically everyone, with the advent of the Internet, and then the last we are living now, which many define as the fourth industrial revolution, where we talk about genetics and capital E is not a typographical error, it is the sense of new problems that we will have to face.
Think that Google is not just hiring computer engineers right now, it is hiring philosophers, to understand where the world ahead of us will go.
We talk about 3D printing, different connection speeds.
When we have a revolution, always the first reaction is fear: I remember my grandmother with the first cordless phone, it was a phone that no longer had the wire, she was worried: “If the words are not in there, where do they go?” Changes are worrying, even the smallest ones.
One economist wrote, I would like to read it with you, “We suffer from an attack of pessimism.
We have experienced faster progress in the last ten years than in all of previous history.
The rapidity of technical change produces difficult problems to solve, the countries that suffer the most are those that are not at the forefront of technical progress.
We are struck by a new malaise: technological unemployment.
A form of unemployment caused by the fact that we discover new ways to save work at a faster rate than we discover new ways to employ work.”
This may be an article today, but it was written in 1930.
And I don't need to tell you what's happened in the decades that separate us since 1930.
It is only to make you understand how much a change can, if not properly interpreted, if not framed in a right vision, create fears, create fears, often unfounded.
One, the classic, is that sooner or later progress will end.
This is the thesis that obviously support the pessimists, those of the parachute, sooner or later the progress will end.
In reality, however, we must think of progress as something that accumulates, does not end, is added to things discovered, inventions, abilities that we had before, is something that adds up, not that ends.
Obviously, progress can then be divided into the various areas of life and so we see that there are different rhythms.
If technological progress is in front of everyone's eyes, as if it had a very steep curve, the progress at the social level, not to mention the progress of the last line at the political level, is slower, because this is precisely the characteristic of this era.
The characteristic of this era is speed.
The changes are so rapid that our brains struggle to interpret them, it struggles to realize, and for this reason we think that things sometimes can not change quickly for the better.
In reality, technological progress is offering us incredible solutions for the well-being of all.
There are thousands of examples, look for example at the graph of the cost of mapping the human genome: 100 million dollars to make a human genome mapping in the 2000s.
100 million dollars, only the 2-3 richest people in the world could afford it.
A few years later it goes down, and goes down with a very optimistic prediction that followed Moore's law, which is the one that tells us that every year the capabilities of microprocessors double.
So it was a very positive projection, “We will soon come from 100 million to 10 million”, it means that instead of the two richest in the world, many millionaires will be able to afford it.
And then something incredible happens, not even foreseen by the most optimistic scientists: that this price drops very quickly and today the mapping, which cost a few years ago 100 million dollars, today costs less than a tablet, is within reach of many people.
What happened?
It happened that the studies of Frederick Sanger, one of the pioneers in this field, the fourth person in the world to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry, were put online.
So it went from a series of concentrated intelligences, 5, 10, 15 researchers locked in a laboratory at 5, 10, 15, 50,000 researchers around the world, and this accelerated the ability to reason on this problem, bringing much cheaper and affordable solutions for everyone.
For example, one of the extraordinary features that this future will have that we will soon live, will be an absolutely transparent world.
I know it's provocative to talk about transparency here, but it will be.
This is a bus stop in Singapore.
With cigarette butts taken from the ground, the profiles of the people who had thrown them were reconstructed, with the traces of the DNA.
From this profile, people take the picture, put it on the bus stop, “If you see this dim, tell them you don’t throw the fags on the ground.”
This is the transparency that we are seeing in many things, even in politics, in communication, we said it before, you can not erase the thing from the internet and it becomes transparent, a world where we have control and we are more and more protagonists.
Clearly it is difficult to perceive this, because if we see that there are taxi strikes in Rome or Milan, maybe we have not seen that in July the first drone taxi in Dubai was inaugurated, which travels alone and maneuvers with a joystick.
And I say, “But I would never go up there,” it’s the same thing we said the first time we went by plane.
We'll go, because it's going to work.
There are paradoxical aspects, maybe we can think that the characteristic of today, the great progress is that we have generations of people glued to a smartphone screen, and it is true that in China and now also in Belgium they have made lanes on the sidewalks for the people who are chatting.
One might even say, “But this very smart progress doesn’t seem to me.”
In fact, there are things behind these advances that should make us think, for example when we talk about 5G.
We are thinking, those who have 4G, “Well what will be 5G?
It will be a bit faster, I can download for example a movie -- legally I'm referring to it- so when I've paid for it, 1 gig I can download it in 7-8 seconds.
A real wonder!”
Actually it's not just that, because this changes you an evening where you don't know what to do at your home.
In reality, 5G networks will have a wider and more powerful capacity than optical fiber, will finally allow automatic driving in cars, will allow you to operate remotely with even greater ease and with even greater precision, will enter our lives, the internet of things will be a reality because these objects will be able to interact with each other at speeds today unthinkable.
And then I say that if you're not optimistic, with everything we have, it's because you probably lack data.
Today the irrational person, who looks to the future, is the pessimist.
And what do we teach our children?
What can we teach our children if statistics and research tell us that 65% of primary school pupils will do a job that doesn’t exist today?
What can we teach him?
I believe that we can teach them, and also we learn, to be better people, people who call themselves optimistic, or those people who transmit positive energy, have common characteristics and I would like to analyze them with you briefly.
They are first and foremost honest people, and it is a revolutionary word in this age, they are normal people, it is not that an optimist has a paresis.
No! No!
He has his own positive moments and his own negative moments, it's the different vision.
It is true that they smile often, optimistic people often smile, then have the ability to share their good mood with other people, they never stop making plans.
That they're 20, 30, 70, don't stop making plans.
They have a unique and extraordinary feature: they emphasize positive things.
We all have negative things in our lives and probably if we make a list they come up right away.
And the positive things, how long would we delay making a list of positive things in our lives?
But if you have a parent, a child, a friend who loves you, a hospital within a radius of 50 km, electric light, drinking water, these are things that should not be taken for granted.
I understand that one must not get home, open the tap and say: “Long live the society of aqueducts!”.
It would be excessive, but you have to realize that this makes you a lucky person.
People who transmit positive energy are generous people, who help others, this we can teach and this we can practice.
They have no prejudices or fear of transmitting, of showing their affection.
So, to be optimistic perhaps today is simply one thing: it is to return to believe in people, but not because man is able to create a 5G network or because he is capable of carrying passengers with a drone, because man is able to do the most wonderful thing that has ever appeared on this Earth: another human being.
And a person who has this ability cannot help you think positively in the future.
So how do I change the world?
There are many who want to change the world, few think about how to change themselves.
I believe that if you really want to change the world, it is simply a matter of being the best version of ourselves.
Thank you
