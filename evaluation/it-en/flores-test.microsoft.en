This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely used, but provides greater details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not endowed with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick down.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals an adult plumage and not that of a chick.

Luminosity is used in conjunction with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star with respect to magnetic reversals.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team's sought effect had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a tidal force of attraction on Earth, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are inserted other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to assist at every step of the process. In the evening, volunteers carry out the counting of votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the race.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's group of the "seated" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place of the Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not finish in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found his mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is being held pending indictment and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who post photos or other things of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for court proceedings, told reporters that no new comments would be released until the formal indictment.
According to the leak, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for pest control had to be carefully monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme, the NPWS in partnership with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four sharpshooters selected for the first firing operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn in in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, challenging the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the non-holding of elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely regrettable."
The earthquake at the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of tsunami in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately freed along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After training in obstetrics, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began studying cases of premature labor.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight records.
Even his wrestling partners wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... Maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... Let's hope he's in a better place," said Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia's transition to republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At opposite ends in the poll, 29% of respondents say Australia should become a republic soon, while 31% believe it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he suffered several ailments that led to doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life, to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since earlier this year as governor; Last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "chatter and political idiocy".
A presidential candidacy is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking spaces available on site.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have brought out the possibility of having the match played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much greater; this is due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into foils.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all homes in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a running water bathroom equipped with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage networks have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To phone someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere partly distorts light and view.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, you need a rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transports.
Thanks to its invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows it not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called herds.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), also with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a tractive force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones roaring.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it looks more like a phrase of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) thanks to smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then swoop down on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to act as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; It continues to need the same adaptations as before.
Over time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era and therefore feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws sprouted more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a species of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting in chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the abode of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of paramount importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is drawn a treasure map.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the extensive parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was affixed only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, i.e. those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
By civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; The term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the sole component of it, according to the Confederation Statute.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, given the absence of national executive or judicial power, relied on the often uncooperative state authorities for the enforcement of its acts.
It didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
To change the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required. These, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands are part of Japanese (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", given the presence of groups of islands that compose it.
Taiwan was born in the fifteenth century, when European sailors who passed through shortly thereafter recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, beginning a transformation that involved the grain production systems of the aborigines and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912); In 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; The island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm, and its width is 36 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power has influenced everyone from the king to commoners.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any boat from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk.
Because this tactic elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 20s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different time periods were referred to in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not at all easy to find, even if it was known to exist. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large amount of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The indication "arch up" resembles a V and the indication "arch down" to a paper clip or a square without the bottom side.
Upwards means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc results in a louder and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your personalized pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archeggio that you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Theresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses, and interest on bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense according to which man's destiny is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time customs, customs and culture have arisen related to such geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similarly to Paris, known nowadays as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige diminished, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the tenth and eleventh centuries and in the fourteenth century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can delay by 25-30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as subsistence when it is practised for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who do not feel they represent society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished according to age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated from people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandoning or fleeing.
Other children may have been raised by animals; Still others seem to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When the feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost completely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the small paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, or even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide him with nourishment, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the twentieth century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of variability expressed.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the period of normal sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
Should you decide to reset your watch in your sleep, you can put it across the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorhythm involve consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hampered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayan rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is grounded in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightenment consciousness develops.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts caused the rupture between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the Allies of the past had become enemies; Thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; The only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans soon proved obsolete as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Taking advantage of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the preservation of its ability to move people and goods, while countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had a chance to conquer Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, fleece, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of pastoralism are still used nowadays.
Already in the sixteenth century in England were built wagonways.
Despite being formed simply by parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that they have in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers used today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer science these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning may be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer bugs and bed bugs are nestlings, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are twice as likely as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; Asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to the children are only those at the level of the germ cells; Mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small country villages to drive to work, bumping into other people whose place of work is where they just left.
In this dynamic comings and goings, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time they support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution for the past two million years.
Each person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing, and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily escape enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Among all the insects existing nowadays, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of up to six miles in places.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. The waters of thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of grandeur and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to learn about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form, and it is possible to extract them quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These in fact look more like the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil then turned out to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons underlies the operation of the fission bomb.
In practice, it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. Then, by breaking down the core further, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the ascent of lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what pleases or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to direct their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it complicated to make unpopular decisions, put disciplinary actions into practice, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the other extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire work of the team and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as matches can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization be willing to go through the long process that leads to building a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you can use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. The search area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our thought processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, speech and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is today often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that can't be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see artifacts from museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; The website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a grammar and spelling little care, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the author of the blog strives to improve the writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to nurture public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the evocative and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario quintessentially Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them are wilderness almost uninhabited.
If we make a comparison of the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the fifteenth century, the discovery of the Cape route, which runs from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of trinkets, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to read up well before making any visits outside Goma, in order to assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In the PBS Henry Louis Gates special "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located northeast of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered the most important of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a gleaming bar chart, all the more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has focused on the densely populated reclaimed lands of the north coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world. It stretches 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about a third is wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated that there are 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby resorts, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, Guyana French.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but only opened to traffic in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and PayaguÃ¡, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the sixteenth century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and on purchasing tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falklands Pound (FKP), whose value equals that of the British pound (GBP).
The islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the outlying islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so change money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not keeping an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space since they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population numbers just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the infamous naval standoff of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 U.S. and German lives have been lost.
In the course of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can bathe safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could cope better with the journey.
Local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee was born from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Juices are expensive, but very good.
There are many excursions on the reef throughout the year and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduse appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear this and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, not living actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity of finding a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to / from the airport or even combined flight + hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos go to great lengths to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests' moods up and make them stay there.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you can't drive like you do on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in no time that you get stuck.
Precipitation and gusts of snow, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the vacation hub for many visitors.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to journeys made by land, particularly into the savannah, to see beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary with each other, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.

If you are not in the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes peeled, as steep slopes, narrow streets and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict adherence is extremely important.
Strangely, however, the level of mobile phone service in this area is much higher than in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria further south.

Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; Its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet remain stuck there.
If a jockey is thrown by a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the horse running away. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures you can take.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs are drawn.

Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are widespread and involve sliding on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (the skiers), who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is connected, although usually does not include them, to touring skiing or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to hiking.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat greater than those covered by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would have to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi have always been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; Some lived on fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi carry out modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the territory of the SÃ¡mi.

The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; In the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water gives rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite telephone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the view clear to the satellite.

Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unusual fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or on the fact that they are not in control.

The only way to get it faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the obvious way is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to shell out up to four times the normal cheap fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on seats in first class or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting quickly and comfortably to their destination, and consequently they charge certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.

Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Orthodox Christian religion.

One tradition is to spend Easter night waking up in an outdoor place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter vigil is frequently held on Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came there by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, the mammals could not cope with the journey. This caused the giant tortoise to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
