[Roberto Battiston] Dare, have the courage to go into space.
Space is an object of fascination, dreams, danger.
What you see is a small solar phenomenon that happened a few years ago: a small spot emitted a large &#39;burst&#39; of particles, plasma, and sun-spot 1,692, exactly as large as the Earth.
What happened in the hours, in the following days: a huge mass of particles, plasma, energy, arrived on Earth two days later and what happened lit up the skies of Northern Europe with formidable aurora borealis, never seen before .
But only this has happened, because the Earth is protected from the phenomena around space, a hostile space, by at least three elements: the magnetic field which deflects the particles, our planet which partially shields us and the atmosphere, which is like having two and a half meters of aluminum in front of us protecting us from particles.
But if we were traveling to Mars, if we did what we have wanted to do for so many years, since the time of von Brown, conquer the Red Planet with astronauts, what would protect us?
How are we going to be able to withstand this and all the other challenges that space offers us?
The space we conquered: this is the International Space Station, the size of a football field, it can accommodate up to nine astronauts.
It is the technological jewel of modern times.
It&#39;s something absolutely fantastic.
Samantha Cristoforetti, Luca Parmitano: our astronauts were hosted for months in this large space hotel where they managed to resist the hostility of space.
But during the mission, an unpredictable thing happened to Luca Parmitano: a small pump that managed the cooling of the space suit in which Parmitano was walking in space, working outside the Space Station, broke.
He started leaking liquid: half a glass of water which however started floating in the helmet, sucked in by the nose and mouth.
He was about to drown in a teacup in space.
Who would have guessed it?
Nobody.
It was about to happen.
He was saved because the other companions quickly brought him inside the inhabited space and he was able to get rid of this half glass of water in which he was drowning.
What is it we are missing?
We lack materials that can repair themselves, systems that are able to protect themselves automatically.
Where can we look for this kind of new technology?
[Nicola Pugno] Nature is obviously able to repair itself.
We see it every day: when we get a scratch, thank goodness, we are able to repair ourselves.
Even recently, since the 2000s, from an engineering point of view, we&#39;ve been able to mimic this feature a bit.
The concept is very simple: you can also imagine it by referring to this projection.
Imagine putting capsules inside a traditional material.
These capsules, in turn, contain a sort of glue, so to speak, on microcapsules, there are many of them spread almost everywhere.
When the crack propagates and tends to break my structure, it also breaks the capsules that release this liquid that mends the crack and therefore, essentially, we have a material that has repaired itself.
It is something that already exists.
There are even paints that are able to self-repair, so that if they get scratched they will sew up by themselves.
[Roberto] A very useful technology!
This is part of a larger picture in which we imitate nature.
[Nicola] Well, sure!
Imitating nature has always been done.
Think also of Leonardo&#39;s studies, especially with regard to flight.
By observing the flight of birds, an attempt was made to build the first machines to fly.
Inspiration is certainly important, rather than mimicking nature tout-court.
For example, planes don&#39;t flap their wings, but we have achieved some very remarkable results that we use, alas, every day.
[Roberto] Very well, then, at this point, it will mean that the next time we have to repair a piece of the Space Station, let&#39;s look, in this case, at a panel that has been unrolled, almost 80 meters long, in a certain point it showed a crack and the astronaut had to sew and sew, repair with enormous effort and risk.
We need more resistant materials that don&#39;t break, that are able to resist the hostility of space, of folding, of opening.
[Nicola] Well, certainly one possibility is to repair themselves, another is that they don&#39;t break.
So, to take inspiration, the most tenacious material, which has the greatest capacity to dissipate energy before breaking, is spider silk.
Spiders are exceptional: just think that even any spider you can find around is capable of making up to seven different types of silks.
Here you see the silk spinning apparatus.
It can therefore produce materials that are either extremely resistant or extremely tenacious, or able to dissipate even more energy with structural solutions that we will see later and are also sticky to block prey.
They can do some really amazing things.
To give you an idea, this material is ten times tougher than Kevlar.
Here you see a junction at the web itself, you have an extra length of silk within a droplet and this further increases the energy dissipation capacity of the web, of the structure.
In doing so an insect is blocked and thus the spider has been able to evolve and survive until today.
[Roberto] The spider&#39;s web is something extraordinary.
There are very special materials in space.
For example, a helicopter on Mars would need, due to the very small atmosphere compared to the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, blades that spin much faster, that are much larger and lighter.
Today we don&#39;t know how to make them: even the most resistant materials such as carbon fiber struggle to resist these truly particular stresses.
[Nicola] Yes, carbon is actually the fiber we know today, from an engineering point of view, at least macroscopically, the most resistant of all.
Six GigaPascals: six times the strength of steel.
Theoretically there is a material that is even more resistant, at least from an ideal point of view, and it is a single layer of carbon atoms: the famous, so to speak, graphene.
Multiple layers of this graphene then make the graphite we have in our pencils, not strong because the planes slide between them, but the single sheet of graphite is extremely strong.
A strength of 100 times that of steel, at least theoretically.
In this way we will certainly be able to make the blades of a helicopter to go to Mars and it could also have application on Earth.
Many people failed to be rescued in Nepal because we didn&#39;t have helicopters to go below a certain altitude.
But we will also be able to do even more extravagant things such as, for example, a space elevator cable to be able to bring mass from Mars to space at very low cost with advantages that we know well because we use elevators.
[Roberto] But if we wanted, beyond a single very resistant layer, to have complex structural materials that we need for a whole series of applications, what has nature done in this sector?
[Nicola] So this is very important.
We use carbon fibers in other matrix materials to build composite materials.
When we mix things up, unfortunately, due to defects and many other things, the resistance breaks down.
Indeed, carbon-based composites are not that strong today.
But there are natural composites.
We recently looked at the composite, the biological material with the highest strength and found it in the nails of the limpets.
By taking these elements and trying the tractions, we saw a mechanical resistance of six GigaPascals, i.e. much greater than the composites that man is capable of producing today.
[Roberto] Exceptional, we are really collecting a really extraordinary amount of input and suggestions from nature.
Well, one of the problems we have in space, both in low orbit and traveling deep, is what&#39;s called space debris, micrometeorites.
They move so fast at 7, 8, 10 kilometers per second that even a very small object - here we have the example of a centimeter of a metal ball - banging against 18 centimeters of aluminum thickness has practically punctured it, deformed it for the enormous energy it dissipated in a way that material as such could not absorb.
We would need screens, much more resistant protections.
What can we look towards nature in this sense?
[Nicola] Think of insects.
Nature evolved absolutely in this context.
Insect armor is one example.
Here we see in particular a very interesting beetle, the so-called bomber beetle, which manages to emit this fluid at high temperature and under great pressure to get rid of its enemies.
That&#39;s why, you may have noticed, I got scared earlier when the drummer emitted these streams, they reminded a bit of this thing we observe here.
The beetle has this remarkable peculiarity, because imagine the material that makes up the internal combustion chamber.
You see, it has this very light structure but it also has this wavy surface and this wavy surface seems to be the key to further resisting explosions, like in this case, but also impacts.
In fact, by doing some simulations - you see a diagram of a numerical simulation at the bottom right - we observed that, with equal mass, with equal average thickness of this slab, if corrugated with a certain undulation, the protective capacity becomes much greater.
One could think, one day, of making screens for spaceships to Mars inspired by the bombardier beetle.
[Roberto] Exceptional, but another problem we have in space is that we need very large structures and when we leave with our missiles by definition they can only be folded.
A difficulty for space engineering is being able to open them, possibly to close them again, in a reliable way, taking advantage of their lightness, when we are in space, and their flexibility and folding when we are still leaving for the Earth.
It&#39;s one of the hardest things to make sure the mechanic develops and heals itself the way we want it to.
From this point of view, what can nature tell us?
[Nicola] Nature can tell us, as always, a lot.
You see a very simple ladybug.
&#39;Simple&#39; so to speak, &#39;very common&#39;, I would say.
The ladybug manages to spread its wings without any problem, it manages to fold them.
Imagine the complexity He folds them thanks to a system of ribs on the wings, which are also structural for the wings, but which, with a sort of elastic stability, so to speak, manages to open and close in a somewhat discontinuous way, therefore in very controlled way, these wings.
So we could imagine doing something similar to control the opening and closing of these panels very well.
[Roberto] This is truly third millennium technology: we need to take an absolutely extraordinary leap to go and do something that nature has already learned for billions of years and is able to do.
We&#39;ve gone to Mars, we&#39;ve landed - we need the resources.
The first resource an astronaut needs is water.
We know that on Mars there is frozen water under the various layers of the ground, but that there is also an atmosphere.
So there must be some water in the Martian atmosphere.
If we could recover the water from the atmosphere like we do on Earth it would be extremely useful.
What could we do, taking inspiration from nature?
[Nicola] There are organizations that manage to do this.
Think for example of the cactus.
Here I would like to give a different example: it is another beetle, the Namibian beetle, a desert beetle, which has a surface which is composed of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.
That is, materials that, on the one hand, manage to attract water and, on the other, absolutely manage to make it flow very well.
This combination of two types of surfaces within the same macroscopic surface means that he is able to recover a lot of water and therefore manages to survive in desert environments.
[Roberto] Fabulous: beetles that take water from the air.
But, speaking of surfaces, we would need self-cleaning surfaces.
For example, this is one of the rovers on the Martian surface.
After a few months, it became covered in dust: the solar panels, which we see on the left, are completely unusable.
Luckily, every now and then, beyond the storms there are lighter winds, small whirlwinds that clean up and, fortunately, put it right again like on the right.
But if we had surfaces that are intrinsically self-cleaning, which manage to eliminate any form of deposit, we would certainly be even better prepared to face an interplanetary journey.
[Nicola] There are certainly self-cleaning surfaces in nature; the most famous is the lotus leaf, so much so that there is talk of the lotus effect.
Here you see some water droplets flowing across this surface.
It gives you a very clear idea of how this is repellent to water, super hydrophobic, in this sense, and it is a particular surface, so much so that it is considered sacred by some populations, because, despite living in marshes, in dirty places, manages to always be very clean.
This is essentially thanks to a surface topology that is invisible to the naked eye, but which under the microscope shows up very well.
A particular topology thanks to which, substantially, the material becomes from a slightly hydrophobic to super hydrophobic, from a chemical point of view.
It is therefore clear that, by mimicking this topology, which can be done today with nanotechnology, we can substantially change the properties of &#39;wetability&#39; - i.e. interaction with water - of surfaces.
Here you see for example a plastic surface inspired by the lotus leaf that we have made, simply with this topology invisible to the naked eye, the interaction with the fluid changes dramatically.
[Roberto] Outstanding!
One of the things that we have seen, an imitation of nature is the famous Velcro.
You remember, it was patented and studied because someone started wondering why a certain type of seeds of some plants stick to their socks when they go to the fields.
Velcro in space is used throughout to attach and close.
Even the suits that go to the moon have pieces of Velcro to be able to quickly make closures.
But nature has done much more on this, hasn&#39;t it?
[Nicola] Velcro is extremely interesting.
The main problem with Velcro is that one element can stick to another, i.e. I can attach the hooks to the microrings that are there.
In nature, clearly, something far more sophisticated was needed.
The most sophisticated animal ever, from this point of view, because the largest, has necessarily had to evolve with the best adhesive mechanisms ever: it is the gecko, which actually has, inside its paw, a number, we have them even counted, billions of gripping elements, of two-dimensional structures, each of which exerts a small force which, added together, makes the gecko&#39;s adhesive resistance very remarkable.
Just to give an idea, an ideal suction cup resists five times.
He also manages to control this adhesion; this is perhaps the most intriguing aspect.
He manages to detach very easily, using a little the concept that we use regularly when we don&#39;t want to get hurt by detaching a plaster, that is, changing the angle in which he removes the hair from the surface.
One could think of gecko-inspired surfaces to move a little where we want.
[Roberto] We also have to explain it to the spider-man who perhaps has to become a gecko-man to go into space.
Well, there is however a problem of duration and exposure to radiation and the difficulties of the deep vacuum in heat and cold and nature has given us extraordinary indications on this too.
Both brewer&#39;s yeast, lichens, streptococci, some complex structures such as plankton, and tardigrades, very small but still complex animals, have been placed in space, exposed to radiation, vacuum, change of temperature, they went into a form of hibernation and then were awakened after 10, 15, 20 months, finding that some of these individuals are still alive.
It&#39;s amazing what nature has done, because it has never been exposed to these conditions, but nevertheless, some of these animals on Earth have had the opportunity to develop these characteristics.
But there is an absolutely impossible challenge to win: the duration of a space trip!
Mars 6.8 months, but first star 100,000 years with current launch and travel techniques.
How can we think of facing such a long journey?
[Nicola] Well, here we can also hope to get inspired but the challenge is very strong.
But it is to mention is the only organism that is known to be immortal.
A jellyfish that is so called, immortal jellyfish, which even has the ability to rejuvenate, that is, to return to the state of a polyp in particularly adverse conditions.
So basically it is as if a man in extreme conditions decides to become a child again and then play his life again when the extreme conditions, too adverse, appear.
It is certainly a very interesting peculiarity and also difficult to mimic.
[Roberto] Now I understand why some science fiction films show octopuses arriving with spaceships who are obviously already aware of this possibility.
In any case it is clear that interplanetary travel, possibly one day when we will have more effective ways to move, the interstellar one, requires very different technologies that we are not used to and that nature, as you have seen, could give us very interesting stimuli and challenges.
Tomorrow we will probably need new technologies.
That&#39;s why the challenge of going to Mars is so interesting to improve all of man&#39;s technical capabilities.
[Nicola] We can&#39;t end like this: when will we go to Mars?
[Roberto] Ah, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m sure that the man and woman who will go there have already been born.
Thank you.
[Applause]
I work in the digital economy in Europe and Italy, and have been lucky enough to spend part of my career in companies headquartered in California.
I have been active for several years as an angel investor, i.e. an investor in start-ups.
For me, 2017 was a year with some satisfaction for my work: I received two awards for my business angel activity, one in Italy and one in Europe; in the past two years I have been among the &quot;inspiring 50&quot;, the 50 most inspirational women in the world of technology in Europe.
I should be over the moon.
But I&#39;m not.
For me, 2017 has, so far, been a losing year for women in tech.
Defeats that hurt us, because they come from the same place where innovation and the future come from; a place that is taken as a model and a place where everything that happens has an echo that spreads throughout the world.
I&#39;m talking about Silicon Valley.
In 2017, episodes and behaviors began to come to light that are disconcerting both in themselves and for the silence with which they were previously hidden.
In February 2017 Susan Fowler, recounting her experience as a developer subject to unwanted sexual attention and rejected in a team of Uber engineers, sets in motion a chain of events that on June 20 leads to the resignation of the CEO, Travis Kalanick.
On June 13, in an internal Uber meeting, entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, who sits on the company&#39;s board of directors, talks about her desire to co-opt more women to the board.
David Bonderman, her colleague, interrupts her with a sexist joke: &quot;More women, equals more talk,&quot; he says.
The reaction leads Bonderman to resign from his position on the board of Uber.
On June 30, The New York Times published a report in which more than two dozen aspiring female entrepreneurs, including Rachel Renock, reported episodes of sexism in the course of their interactions with the venture capital funds they proposed to invest in their companies.
In July Dave McClure, founder of the &quot;500 startups&quot; incubator, resigned after admitting improper behavior towards female entrepreneurs seeking funding, collaborators and candidates.
Including Sara Kunst, who told her story to the New York Times.
In August, an internal memo written by a Google employee, James Damore, went public, criticizing the company&#39;s diversity initiatives, arguing that women are biologically unfit to do the job of programmer.
On August 7, Google terminated its employment relationship with him; quickly, he becomes the mouthpiece of a misogynistic and alt-right current of thought in Silicon Valley.
In years past, wonderful things have come to us from California: cultural exports like James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, the Beach Boys, the beat generation, hippy culture, black panthers, California punk music, Ronald Reagan , Blade Runner, the Mac, Indiana Jones, the iPhone.
This year we only got the poison between men and women.
Lots of poison.
I will now take a step back to the early 90s.
At that time, as a recent graduate, I began my career in a strategic consultancy multinational in Milan.
I didn&#39;t have many female role models, in fact we can say that I only had one: this is Marisa Bellisario, an economics graduate in the early 1990s.
She worked as a programmer on the first Olivetti mainframes, then made a commercial career in Olivetti, in General Electric.
In 1981 she became managing director of Italtel: a huge company in a deep crisis which, in a few years, she completed the turn around.
He conquers the covers of world magazines, stands out for his hairstyles, clothing, it is known that he would have reached further career goals if it hadn&#39;t been for the veto placed by some men of power.
In 1988 he died at the age of 53 of bone cancer.
So I started my career with just one female manager role model.
And she wasn&#39;t even alive anymore, she was already dead.
Some time ago I was curious to go and see what the people who started their careers with me in that same place, in that same year, are doing today.
Men are CEO, more than half; general manager; managing director; senior partners; managing partner; chief strategy officer.
Women, no.
Women do, with some important and bright exceptions, other things.
They took other paths.
I took mine on the road: I work as an independent advisor and as a business angel, as I told you.
In my career I have held positions of responsibility, I have had many satisfactions.
Today I am an independent, a freelancer: I am invited to speak in public on the topics of the digital economy, startups, innovation; and even to testify about the success of professional women managers, and to talk about my work, in particular, in Italy and abroad.
But I don&#39;t have a top chair.
Yes, I have important responsibilities: but I don&#39;t exercise any power, if not shared and collegial within the councils to which I belong.
I&#39;m just an independent, a freelancer.
And so are most of the colleagues I have met along the way.
So what happened to my generation of women?
What prevented them from achieving the career goals they set for themselves in the early 1990s, and what can we do to ensure that whatever happened to us doesn&#39;t happen to those who come after us?
So that other women can achieve their goals without crashing into a wall?
And what are the costs of this state of affairs?
It is well known that the world economy, the well-being of all of us, pays a cost in terms of growth failure due to the absence of women from decision-making processes in the world of work; according to the OECD we are losing two and a half points of growth over the next eight years due to the participation gap.
If we halved it, the world would grow more.
In companies, the lack of diversity in management, correlated with a lower degree of innovation than that found in companies where at least 20% of top managers are women.
But these economic arguments are familiar and strange, and they do not push for change.
Instead, I would like to give you some data on the human costs of the situation we are in and these costs concern not only women but also men, these men to whom, in the vast majority of cases, we entrust the roles of power in companies, while to women we entrust other assignments.
We have concrete evidence, for example, of how decoupling masculinity from the role of breadwinner, or income earner, could have important benefits for women and men.
An American study shows us that if the couple&#39;s incomes diverge over time in favor of the man, the man&#39;s physical and psychological health is more likely to deteriorate: anxiety and depression increase.
And the effect is even stronger if the man remains the only one of the two to bring income.
A longitudinal study of 72,000 Swedish men showed that men who took parental leave for a period of one to two months outlived their peers who did not, decades after having a child. equality of age, education, occupational level.
The death rate of men who cared for their young children was 24 percent lower than that of those who didn&#39;t.
The experience of taking care of newborns seems to have, in fathers, an effect of prevention of risk behaviors, in particular alcoholism; and it is an effect that lasts for decades to come.
So what drives equality at work and at home?
Equal economic opportunities and care duties?
Unfortunately there is no silver bullet, we can only make some considerations.
A study of 6,000 Danish companies with a male CEO showed that when a first-born daughter is born to the boss, the wage gap in the company narrows because women&#39;s wages rise faster than men&#39;s.
This does not occur if the firstborn is a son.
A US study suggests that venture capital funds whose partners have daughters hire more women.
[And] not only are they hiring more women, they are also performing better.
It is clear that requiring that those exercising power in companies have daughters is unfortunately not a policy lever that can be activated; we cannot force top managers to reproduce or to generate these strange beings of a different sex than their own.
Perhaps as a tip to girls at their first job, before sending that resume it&#39;s worth taking a look at the family composition of those who sit in the control room.
What does all this mean?
That gender stereotypes, which exist and are there for all to see, don&#39;t just hurt women.
Stereotypes are cages: a slightly wider and more comfortable cage for men, a narrower and limiting cage for women and an even tighter one for transgender, intersex and binary people.
So stereotypes really hurt everyone.
They hurt us women who accept being seen as the queens of multitasking and leaving too much power to men.
As a result we still suffer from a wage gap, we have less career, we accumulate less wealth and less savings, we are less autonomous.
And the prejudice against us seems to be as alive in the millennial generation as it is in their parents&#39;.
But stereotypes are also bad for men, because masculinity can become a trap.
From infancy we socialize boys as incomplete children who can express a limited range of emotions.
If a little girl wants to play soccer, or loves cars, by now we understand that it&#39;s okay, we let her be a little tomboy.
But if a kid loves ballet, we still treat him like Billy Elliot in the 80s.
So let&#39;s raise these male children, too, in their cage of stereotypes of masculinity.
We send them to school, then they go to work and we expect them to be the economic engine of the family.
With their baggage of stereotypes, and with ours.
When a woman leaves her job outside the home to devote herself to her children, which tragically happens much more than it should, she has our full solidarity.
We say: look at the good mother, look at the heroine, what sacrifices she has made to raise her children.
In the few cases in which, on the other hand, it is a man who makes this decision, staying at home with his children, perhaps because the woman earns better than him, we punish him by perceiving him as weak and inadequate.
This double standard is very dangerous.
The stereotype hurts everyone: women, men and all of society.
My feeling is that elsewhere women are moving a little faster than here in the West.
For example, in China, going beyond the stereotype, 55 percent of digital startups are founded by women.
How many of us are there?
And women in China are partners in 80% of venture capital funds.
They decide which initiative to invest in.
They are on the move, they move, they go forward: we here, in the West, have the sensation of standing still, or advancing almost millimeterly and, every now and then, going back.
Because even in very innovative environments, where the future is produced, it is as if women and men in the world of work were separated by a great canyon.
And from this canyon came the summer of poisons, which I told you about a moment ago.
There is an air of defeat, there is a lot of bitterness for having tried to win without having taken into account that the dice were loaded.
It&#39;s enough to make me want to give up dialogue, to return to being among the like, to shut ourselves up among those who understand us, to cut ties.
But I, on the other hand, am convinced that, more than ever, it&#39;s time to build bridges: build bridges between women and men so that they can meet halfway and shake hands.
Making an effort together: now is the time to challenge the canyon that divides women and men.
What does it mean concretely?
I would not like to repeat the recipes already known, such as the need for companies to activate a different organization of work; or like the voluntary effort of let&#39;s come forward, of lean-in, which is largely the responsibility of women.
Today I have three new recipes for you that all have to do with building bridges: one personal, one media and one political.
The first is personal: hygiene in the workplace is your responsibility.
I&#39;m talking about behavioral hygiene: if you are a man, you must know that a thousand things happen every day at work: interruptions, jokes, comments, words said in a low voice, ideas generated by one person and attributed to another, who a woman have the effect of a thousand cuts in the skin made with the edge of a sheet of paper.
And that you men often don&#39;t even notice.
Sit down with a woman and ask her, if and when it happens, to point it out to you, discreetly but effectively, as it happens.
With a gesture, with a glance, with a pre-agreed signal.
Then take aside the men who have interrupted, teased, excluded or belittled a woman and explain to them that this, in 2017, is no longer acceptable.
If you&#39;re a woman, however, don&#39;t waste your energy needlessly holding in your frustration, or trying to explain these things to yourself.
Find a male ally, build a bridge with him, and have him work on it.
The second recipe is the media one: look critically at the role messages that surround us.
Your children&#39;s textbooks are full of stereotypes, even today, in 2017.
Dads and moms, look at these texts.
Not just moms.
Talk about it with the teachers and have texts adopted that are more appropriate to the times we live in.
Television, advertising, are always part of the media environment that surrounds us.
And we&#39;re not just talking about the classic woman object, who must disappear from our screens without ifs, ands or buts.
Let&#39;s talk about those cages made of stereotypes that in 2018 will have to cease to exist in the United Kingdom because the Authority for Standards in the world of Advertising has decided to implement new anti-stereotype guidelines.
For example, commercials in which the whole family makes a mess and only the mother tidies up could be sanctioned; those in which an activity typical of girls is presented as not suitable for boys, or vice versa; those in which a man is made fun of because he tries in vain, and without success, to carry out the tasks of taking care of the house or family.
Do we also want commercials without these stereotypes?
Well, let&#39;s make our voices heard, women and men.
This includes the creatives in the agencies, the clients of the advertising campaigns, the decision makers within the companies and all of us consumers.
The third recipe is the political one: there is a great taboo that we must eradicate in Italy and that is that parental leave should be reserved for women.
It&#39;s true, every time you try to give men an extra day of 100% paid paternity leave, the public coffers cry; but habits don&#39;t change by lavishing days with a dropper.
Habits are changing all over the world: in companies like Facebook, which offers all its employees up to 4 months of paternity leave when they become fathers; or Spotify, which offers 6.
But other than the big, successful companies that can afford to have such equal policies, what can we do?
We have a great resource in Italy: after compulsory leave, optional parental leave: today it is six months, only partially paid and available only to the mother.
It is politically possible, if we form an alliance between men and women, to institute optional bipartisan leave: three months for one parent, three months for the other, without being able to be exchanged or transferred.
This way women would go back to work sooner, a huge benefit; fathers would find themselves learning care work and perhaps, like the Swedes, living longer; and third, all of society would function better.
In an ideal world, men and women with a new baby would be home for the same amount of time.
No one in the company would ever be denied a job, a project, a promotion, a pay raise because they might have a baby.
We can no longer afford, men and women, not to be feminists.
Building bridges is the only way to poison the world we live in.
With the three recipes I told you about today, we could go a long way.
For this I leave you with the words of a man who speaks as a feminist.
Thank you.
(Applause) [English: It is vital that everyone understands] [that men not only can,] [but should be feminists.]
[And I&#39;m proud of it] [Being a feminist, for me, means recognizing] [that men and women should, can, must have equal rights.]
[And second, that there is still a huge amount of work to be done.]
[He for She is a movement sponsored by the United Nations,] [which I hope you all join,] [of men standing up for women.]
[Of men who nip those offensive conversations in the bud] [that are born in the locker room, and in a culture of camaraderie].
[We need to know we can be better than this!]
[The way we treat our sisters, girlfriends,] [cousins, mothers, and the world around us,] [counts!]
[We must rediscover the true meaning of manhood] [which is openness, respect, compassion] [and the courage to stand up for all of this!]
(Applause)
Holy Father, I started writing to you two years ago.
An advanced spring morning, in a village in the Langhe, with cobblestone streets spiraling up to the square.
On the square a castle and an ancient church like there are many in Piedmont.
From that square, the valley opens out at breakneck speed, in the background, the hills covered in woods: chestnut and hazel trees, below, the vineyards and cornfields.
The beauty of the Langhe, there the extraordinary beauty of the landscape coexists with the horror of certain families, mine: bourgeois, in the indifference of many.
Holy Father, my name is Ginevra, I am 40 years old, I am originally from Turin, I grew up there and attended high school.
Then I met the man who would become my husband, it was autumn.
He came from the Langhe, Cuneo, a lean young man with good manners.
He had just enrolled in medicine in Turin, Corso Massimo d&#39;Azeglio.
That day the mists of the Po rose in the park, the air made us drunk, we looked at each other and were happy.
A dream left in the blood.
Graduated, specialized, married, a lavish wedding.
I moved to your country.
First child: Matthew, a gift from God.
Then Pietro and Luca, the twins.
Peter is the stone on which Jesus founded his Church, Luke is the light, the favorite of the Madonna, Saint Luke is the patron saint of doctors.
Franscesca: green eyes and blond curls, elusive look... she looks like me.
My children are beautiful.
They have that healthy color of a country dweller.
At the foot of the Langhe, at the confluence of two rivers, 300 meters above sea level.
Once, a stopover for wayfarers and pilgrims on the ancient salt road that connected Albenga to Alba.
We live in a large farmhouse, during the day, the children play barefoot in the grass and jump for joy, the crickets sing at night.
Andrea is the heir of a rich family, owners of a building in the city and a beautiful villa by the sea in San Remo.
His family is known in our village, they make many donations to the church, and on Sundays he always shows up at Mass in the wooden pew in the front row with his family name written on it.
As a young man he took the time to travel, but instead of marrying a country girl, a girl used to country life, he chose me.
Turinese, a foreigner in Cuneo, slender and blonde like some others she had met in the world.
Unfortunately, our beautiful story ends here.
My husband doesn&#39;t have the moral virtues of King Arthur, when he returned to live in the country he changed.
It will be the peasant culture, male chauvinist, it will be friends at the bar, for them women don&#39;t count, they are made to serve them.
The fact is that Andrea has become violent, he has been beating me for twelve years, now he is also using violence against children.
No Lancelot capable of saving us is wandering around, ours is not a degraded situation, like some suburbs: far from it.
Andrea is primary, earns well.
Of course, he is not generous with me: he gives me a few euros at a time, in the evening he asks for the receipts from the grocer, he goes to the butcher at the end of the month, but, after all, the money is there.
The other night Andrea kicked me, I was too tired, I couldn&#39;t resist the pain, I screamed.
The little girl woke up with a start, crept up the stairs and saw me on the ground while her father was hitting me.
The next morning, at school, she burst into tears, the teacher hugged her, she made her tell her everything, she was surprised: she has always known Andrea.
She never expected it to be violent.
But children don&#39;t tell lies.
The teacher summoned me, she said she would talk to him.
I begged her not to do it, we risk being killed, me and the child.
For now, I don&#39;t feel like rebelling, I can&#39;t leave this beautiful house and move with my four children to a small apartment.
And then my husband is Catholic, he doesn&#39;t want to be separated.
My parents are also Catholics, practicing.
They live in the city, I don&#39;t see them often.
My mother has sensed something, but I don&#39;t want to sadden her with my problems, I already know that she wouldn&#39;t like a divorced daughter.
In reality I don&#39;t want to leave Andrea, I don&#39;t want to go to the Carabinieri, as advised by a friend, a high school classmate, the only one I hear from time to time.
It would be like cheating on him.
Maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong, it all seems so strange to me.
When I met him, Andrea was kind, he is even now: he beats me up, then hugs me, says he loves me.
It happens often.
If I bleed, obviously he does the dressing, he doesn&#39;t want to go to the emergency room, everyone knows him there.
Often the family, instead of being the image of love, becomes a place of peaceful cruelty.
The other day I returned home, I found Andrea&#39;s mother in front of her when she was young, she was abusive, she beat her husband and children, she doesn&#39;t speak Italian at home, she uses dialect.
In that rough language, a few nights ago he incited Andrea to hit me.
Then it was she, my mother-in-law, who sent me away, away from home, the children watched, amazed.
Maybe it&#39;s because here oxen and people are a whole race, I&#39;m from Turin, I come from a respectable, middle-class family.
She would have preferred a girl from here, one of those who stay at home and say nothing.
Sunday I went to confession, Don Paolo says I have to be patient, bear it.
People tried by the greatest sufferings are favored by God, said Jesus.
I mustn&#39;t complain, the family is sacred, it cannot be broken up.
Certainly it is difficult to remain united, if we are not all respectful of each other, but what is at stake here is not only respect, there is violence, violence severs love.
After beating me, Andrea goes to confession, repents and the priest forgives him.
Then he does it again, he hits me again and Don Paolo forgives him again.
He&#39;s a country priest, my mother-in-law brings him chickens and rabbits, stories from the past.
Andrea means &quot;man&quot;.
Holy Father, in the Mass at the beginning of your pontificate you said that every man must be a guardian of himself and of others.
Andrea was watching Mass on TV, then a pretext was enough for him to hit me again, in front of the children: it became normal, even for me.
I remain silent, staring at my man.
I had four children, but here the women are like they were then: they have children, and they don&#39;t count for anything.
I&#39;m bruised, hiding my cheekbone with a little make-up. I have to do something for them, for my children, the eldest started throwing up his hands.
Holy Father, I heard you on the radio talking about the first believers, I would like to ask you for help.
Perhaps a word from him would be enough to put an end to so much violence, violence disguised as love, I&#39;ve heard.
But maybe that wouldn&#39;t help.
What can be said that hasn&#39;t already been said?
Unless you, Holy Father, decide to speak to priests, to those like Don Paolo, why they don&#39;t grant forgiveness so easily to men like my husband.
May the Church forgive, where she feels sincere repentance because only formal repentance serves to return to the sacraments but also to the usual violence.
We must show repentance, try to correct ourselves.
In the face of fiction, the priest cannot and must not absolve.
Holy Father, I already wrote to you a couple of years ago but you had just ascended the papal throne, it was the wrong time.
You already know, my name is Ginevra, I&#39;m Piedmontese like your grandfather Giovanni and your great-grandfather Francesco.
I live in Turin, beautiful, ancient, when the evening becomes a star in front of a large choir of people.
Turin means Naples that goes to the mountains, Turin: straight roads, it is the other face of Rome itself, Turin, a city sick with melancholy, as Venditti sings it.
We live in a condominium on Corso Francia, a straight road: it starts from Piazza Statuto, Porta Susa and leads to France, to Chambéry.
Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy had wanted it in 1711, it connected the Royal Palace with the Rivoli residence.
During the Second World War, when Italy entered the war against France, the city authorities changed the name to Corso Gabriele D&#39;Annunzio.
After the war it becomes Corso Francia again. Today the subway passes underneath it: nine stops.
At the beginning of Corso Francia there are many beautiful villas, Liberty style, early twentieth century.
We live a little further, towards Rivoli, on the outskirts of Turin.
The employees live in my apartment building.
Early in the morning they rush to work.
Where I live is not my home.
It is the house where I grew up, that of my parents.
They are elderly, they left me their furnished apartment and moved to the countryside.
Now, let me tell you how I found the courage to go to the Carabinieri and report Andrea.
At first I didn&#39;t want to.
Francesca was in the fourth grade when her father kicked me on the carpet.
The next morning, she told the teacher everything.
Worried, the teacher wanted to go to Andrea, to talk to him.
It wasn&#39;t good for the little girl to tell those things around.
I begged her not to say anything, she would have beaten me and the baby to death.
I had made my decision.
For Frances.
Today he is in sixth grade.
After talking to the teacher, I went to the Carabinieri and to the Emergency Department.
They ascertained the bruises, it hadn&#39;t been the worst time, I had been beaten much worse.
But that was enough to file a complaint.
A few weeks later I went to a law firm, in Turin I entrusted myself to a lawyer for the criminal case, to another for the civil case.
I didn&#39;t ask for state patronage, I wanted someone I trusted.
I spent everything I had on lawyers.
A huge sacrifice.
Now Andrea gives me 500 euros a month for each of our children.
He should have given me more, he&#39;s rich, but the properties are in his mother&#39;s name.
It doesn&#39;t matter to him if the children no longer have the same opportunities as before.
He doesn&#39;t care about the sacrifices I make to pay for the English course, violin.
The kids have changed their lives, giving up many things, attending public school, yet they don&#39;t complain.
They never said they wanted to go back to the village, to their father.
They don&#39;t miss that old farmhouse, with its vaulted, frescoed ceilings, the terrace, those beautiful arches.
Part-time job, secretary, in a museum, 900 euros a month.
In short, the expenses are many, even if I only pay my parents 500 euros in rent, a symbolic amount, they are retired teachers, some health problems, they manage, but I can&#39;t expect more.
They already do a lot, and in any case they don&#39;t have great availability.
They are Catholics, practicing, and after many reservations they have finally accepted that I have left my husband and asked for a separation.
And to think that two years ago they told me to be patient, to turn the other cheek.
My brothers, on the other hand, just can&#39;t accept my choice.
They live outside Turin, I rarely see them.
I know that the time available to me is running out, Holy Father, let me tell you the reactions of Andrea and his family: when I left he was very sad.
Now she plays the part of the gentleman betrayed in his honor, and I pass for crazy.
The week is in a white coat in the emergency room, on Saturdays a volunteer at the Green Cross and occasionally with the elderly.
Church on Sunday.
I&#39;m the one who made it all up.
He sued me.
Five open cases in court.
My mother-in-law took it worse: a beast, wounded in pride, thought that silence would protect everyone.
For her I&#39;m a witch, to be sent to an asylum: she doesn&#39;t understand how I could raise my head, give up my life as a lady to live in an unrenovated suburban apartment.
I just gave the blank, it held everything.
Few clothes, I didn&#39;t have any jewels, he never gave me any.
The round of pearls?
Gift from my mom for my eighteenth birthday, that&#39;s how it is used in Piedmont.
I never went back to the village, it&#39;s Andrea&#39;s territory.
I can&#39;t even enter that house to get my things. I left in a hurry, two years ago, it was June, school was about to end, I was just in time to collect my report cards.
One evening Andrea was on call at the hospital.
I took the children and we went to Turin, 80km in the old car that Andrea had returned a few months later through lawyers.
We didn&#39;t leave any friends in the village, neither me nor the boys: they were isolated, the father never wanted anyone at home.
It wasn&#39;t easy but I did it, we did it.
Holy Father, I&#39;m not asking you anything, I just wanted to tell you how it went, that&#39;s all.
In church?
I go there every Sunday, I take my children. They were used to that beautiful old church: after Mass, while the bells were ringing in celebration, we went out onto the square, with a view of the Langhe.
Now let&#39;s go to the neighborhood parish, in Corso Francia.
It&#39;s not the same, but that&#39;s okay.
I spoke to a priest about my experiences, I met him by chance, he left a mark on the train.
His name was Father Carlo Caroglio, he said that one shouldn&#39;t be subjected to violence, he was a modern city priest, originally from Alessandria, he had lived in Novara for a long time, before becoming a priest he had studied as a chemical expert, like you did.
Don Carlo was different from the village priest, the one who still says to Andrea: &quot;You don&#39;t have to feel guilty if your wife has left you, a wife who abandons you doesn&#39;t love you, it&#39;s her who should be ashamed, it&#39;s not worthy of you.&quot;
Andrea beat me up, then he went to the priest, said he repented, and the priest absolved him.
For this, Andrea feels on the right side.
Your Holiness, I have nothing else to tell you, there is no more time.
I trust in your goodness and understanding.
I only ask you one thing: make sure that priests don&#39;t always absolve violent men.
My warmest regards, Guinevere.
(Applause)
I will tell you a story.
A few weeks ago, I accompanied my daughter, 10 years old, named Ilaria, to school.
But I wasn&#39;t dressed like that, so I didn&#39;t have a shirt and jacket.
My daughter, with the typical curiosity of 10-year-old girls, says to me: daddy, you&#39;re not going to work today.
I say: no, today I actually work from home.
She looks at me and says, well, you probably don&#39;t have anything important to do.
(Laughter) And that got me thinking a little bit.
It made me think how much, in reality, we ourselves contribute to creating prejudices in our children.
Because I will tell you that, in reality, in my view, work is not a place where you go.
Work is changing, it is changing profoundly.
I will tell you some things that go to support this thesis of mine.
It is changing because there are skills that are increasingly rare, but increasingly in demand by the market and by companies.
A BCG study has certified that approximately 30 percent of high-tech positions will be vacant in the next 18-24 months due to lack of skills.
Just imagine: 30 percent of positions will remain unfilled due to lack of skills, especially in the world of data science and machine learning, therefore the most modern, most advanced skills.
So, from this point of view, we&#39;re having a bit of trouble building the skills we want to see in our organizations of the future.
We chase them.
Another interesting fact is that about 66 percent of CIOs, who are responsible for information infrastructure of companies, say that the talent shortage is approaching crisis dimensions, so it is becoming a very strong theme.
Another very important element: artificial intelligence and automation and robotization are changing the world of work.
Again the same study by BCG, which I invite you to read, is called: &quot;12 forces that are changing the way organizations work&quot; has certified that, between now and the next 10 years, 70 percent of the professions that we today we do will be drastically changed or even disappear.
And, if we look at what the World Economic Forum says, two-thirds of children studying in primary school today are preparing for jobs that don&#39;t exist yet.
Impressive, if I think of my children who are now in elementary school.
Another theme: the average life of some skills, of some engineering skills, has dropped drastically and is now between two and a half and five years.
What does it mean?
That if a person does not make up his mind to invest in himself and to play the game of continuous learning he will, in a short time, be little &quot;employable&quot;.
But there are also some softer forces that are changing the world of work.
For example, having a strong culture within the organization.
The fact that about 90 percent of companies consider culture a distinctive and competitive factor for the success of the organization is certainly something very significant, very important.
And, from this point of view, there is correspondence.
Because even the people who live in organizations are putting culture and a sense of purpose at the center of their journey.
62 percent of millennials don&#39;t want a job, don&#39;t want a paycheck, don&#39;t want an office job.
He wants to have a career that produces a strong social impact.
And, this is my opinion, it&#39;s probably not just millennials who want a job, a career that helps them have a strong social impact.
Another soft force that is changing the world of work is the increasing attention towards the world, the theme of diversity and inclusion.
In the United States, 80 percent of people employed in organizations say that it is a factor in choosing their position and the company that organizations put diversity at the center.
And 72 percent of the same people say they are willing to leave the organization they work for for an organization that is more inclusive and more attentive to the issue of diversity.
So, it&#39;s becoming a talent attraction.
It&#39;s becoming such a strong theme that McKinsey did a study that showed that companies that invest seriously in diversity and inclusion are 15 percent more likely to be financially successful.
So, it&#39;s not just a nice, nice thing to work with.
It is a differential factor for the economic results of the organization.
Finally, work - and this is probably the focus of reasoning - is increasingly fluid and flexible.
There&#39;s -- there&#39;s the explosion of co-working spaces.
In Italy we have some beautiful success stories on this issue.
Smart working has become a theme at the center of corporate strategies.
The smart working observatory of the Milan Polytechnic claims that by now most companies in Milan have adopted smart working strategies.
And then there is another theme, equally important: skills are being formed in places where, until a few years ago, it was unthinkable to see them.
Think about how many graduates there are who are exiting the computer engineering path in India or China.
And this is forcing organizations to rethink their strategies.
If, until yesterday, organizations placed an office where it made sense to place it and then attracted talent, today the same organizations are questioning themselves, they are wondering if this strategy is really the right one.
And they&#39;re putting offices where the talent is.
The explosion of jobs, especially with a technological content, in India has been very strong in recent years.
Work is increasingly fluid and flexible: it is increasingly normal, increasingly common to see a work team where the boss is based in Washington and the five members of his staff are based in Caracas, Madrid, Greece, Shanghai or Sydney , maybe on 5-6 different timezones.
So, from this point of view, is the office still needed?
I have my doubts.
I have my doubts because, as I told you, in a world of work that is changing in a very strong way, in which skills are increasingly scarce, the war for talent is ever stronger, the world in which artificial intelligence, automation are changing the way organizations work, in a world where the issues of a sense of purpose and the diversity of inclusion are returning, in an overbearing way, to the center of corporate strategies, in a world where, evidently, organizations are increasingly fluid and flexible, I think no, it doesn&#39;t make much sense.
And so, here, my idea, very simple, very clear: to help our children overcome prejudices, to question them.
And to remove them, if they have any.
Because the world of work is changing, the world of work will be characterized by an activity that is carried out with more and more passion, with more and more sense, with more and more desire to focus on the theme of continuous learning that I have been looking for. to represent.
So our aim is this: to talk to our children about this issue, to talk about how, from a practical point of view, work cannot be a physical space, it cannot be the office.
We don&#39;t &quot;go to work,&quot; even though we often say so.
We do, a job.
And so, my point is exactly this: work must necessarily be our story to our children.
Something you do, certainly not a place you go.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon, good afternoon everyone.
Today I bring you into my world.
I tell you about diversity in the world of the blockchain.
But let&#39;s take a step back: what is the blockchain?
The blockchain is a new layer, level, of the Internet that has fundamental characteristics: it is open, incorruptible, immutable, transparent and decentralized.
And it is commonly called web 3.0.
If web 1.0 was the era in which companies communicated directly with users, and in fact there was a two-way communication, let&#39;s call it: companies promoted, perhaps, their products on the Internet; and users bought directly on e-commerce; and the web 2.0 era, on the other hand, was the era in which users began to interact with each other, to exchange information and data on blogs, social media, etc., the blockchain allows the introduction of the exchange of value without intermediation.
We know that this technology will impact many industries, not just the world of finance; and we know that we have to get there prepared.
We don&#39;t know when this will happen, but we know that we must not only arrive prepared in terms of products but also of the workforce, which constitutes and builds this new world, this new technology.
For example, in my company we believe in this vision of the &#39;tokenization&#39; of everything, in the so-called &quot;tokenization of everything.&quot;
In other words, we think that any asset, any form of value, in the future - whether it&#39;s a house, a car, a precious metal, a luxury item, a work of art - can be transformed, digitized into a token that can then be traded on this blockchain, on this new technology.
To give you some examples, imagine companies that work in the textile sector or in the food industry, which can thus control all the processes of the supply chain in terms of, for example, anti-counterfeiting; or let&#39;s think of art enthusiasts, who cannot afford to buy a painting, for example by Andy Warhol, but can invest in a fraction of that work of art and can exchange this fraction, this token, with other fractions of works of art, always in the key of investment.
But if we know that the blockchain is a technology that will impact everyone&#39;s daily life, through many products, the workforce that composes it must reflect this technology, must be able to speak to everyone.
Today I&#39;m going to talk to you about diversity, therefore what I represent to a certain extent in my world.
And to tell you about it, I looked for the definition: I wanted to come up with a good definition of diversity, in reality I found a lot of them, one different from the other, because we constantly hear about it in so many keys.
It is related to sexual orientation, ethnicity, socio-economic background.
In my view, the best corporate definition of diversity is the ability to create a workforce where everyone, whoever they are, first and foremost feels welcomed and feels they are contributing to building the future of this company.
Intuitively, we know that diversity is a positive factor: now there is also research that effectively demonstrates to us, with data, that companies that implement this characteristic, this factor, at all levels of their management, from top management down, also have greater financial return.
And this suggests to us that it does not only concern gender diversity, man or woman, but all the diversity that we have previously mentioned.
But why does this happen?
Why are companies with more diversity more successful in the marketplace?
Because they know how to listen more to what is happening out there, they develop a different sensitivity to understand what consumers actually want.
At what stage are we, however, now, in this historical moment, of diversity in the world of technology, of technical companies, which then concern my world, but not only?
We at Circle, my company, really wanted to understand women&#39;s interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, more specifically, which are our field.
So we did a survey, in the United States, which is one of our markets, of more than 3,000 people, ranging in age from 24 to 74.
Guess what?
The blockchain and cryptocurrencies are of interest to males, millennials, whites.
This is the state of affairs.
And the results we have obtained, crossed with other research, other surveys, are always the same: there is approximately five percent, approximately - just think, only five percent of women who make up the workforce in this field, who are founders of blockchain companies, investors, enthusiasts, engineers.
What I want to tell you today is that to work in the blockchain world you don&#39;t need to be 20-year-old nerds who stay in front of a computer all day and have an engineering degree, are passionate about finance, investments .
For example, think of me: today I will briefly tell you about my journey, because I think it is no coincidence that I have sought this type of innovation and technology.
I come from a completely different field.
I come from the world of the sharing economy, I didn&#39;t study engineering or science: I studied economics, and then I did marketing.
For study, and for work, I&#39;ve lived a bit around the world, in the sense that I&#39;ve always been, since I was a little girl, an &quot;early adopter&quot;, that&#39;s how I define myself.
I&#39;ve always been the first one who wanted to try something new, who wanted to find out which innovation would then be successful, shortly thereafter.
And I was lucky, because my first example - I grew up alone with my mom.
So my family consisted of me, my mom and my little dog.
And she has always - instead of tying me up, holding me, she has always urged me to try, do, go.
And so I did, in the sense that first, from the provinces - I grew up in the Piedmontese fog, I spent my first 19 years there - then from the provinces I went to Milan to study.
After three years in Milan - which was my dream, it seemed to me an unattainable thing - Milan was already mine, and it was time to move on to the next adventure.
And so I lived, precisely, for various reasons, study, work, in New York, London and Paris.
Just think that when I was entering the world of work, the tech wave of startups was just arriving in Europe.
And I immediately realized that I wanted to be part of that area.
And even though it was much more risky than working in large multinational companies that had already started, I wanted to do that thing.
I wanted to find economic models that would impact the lives of millions of people, when people still don&#39;t realize it.
And so I discovered there was a small Californian company at the time that was looking for the first people to open the European market: at the time there were 100 people in all, in the company.
So I sent my CV, and imagine, after two hours they answered me.
After a week I was hired.
And together with two other guys, we opened the Italian Uber market.
I worked at Uber for four years, it was a decisive and wonderful experience for me, honestly.
After four years on the Italian market, I said: now I want to try another challenge.
Send me to India, I want to work in an emerging market that has a completely different scale than Italy, I want to see what happens there, how this technology moves there.
I arrive in India, I live in Mumbai for a few months and there I hear, for the first time, talk about blockchain, which I honestly didn&#39;t know before.
And I&#39;m starting to fall in love with it.
So I understand, I feel it, I say: here we go again.
Now that the sharing economy is an established, successful model that is impacting all areas of the world, I want to stand out, I want to try this new technology again, this new innovation, in which no one yet believes.
And so I start looking for companies that operate mainly in this sector, and I come across my current one.
I honestly tell you that I was a bit hesitant, because I said: I&#39;m sure I find myself a team of technology-loving males who tinker all day in front of the computer.
And I have nothing to do with it in there.
They go through the selection process for me, and in the process of selection I fall madly in love with my company and my colleagues.
First of all I cross my boss, who is my myth; and then I meet many women who have key roles in the company, from the Europe manager of communication to the Europe manager of the legal world.
And therefore these two factors: the selection process, in which I feel absolutely welcomed and I understand that there is the right space for me; plus the innovation factor, I wanted to be among the first to try, to find that thing, it certainly pushes me to become part of this world.
But let&#39;s take a step back: the world is made up of 50 percent women and 50 percent men, in fact.
And we know that technology -- what is the ultimate goal of technology?
Solving everyone&#39;s everyday problems.
Consequently, it goes without saying that companies, even the workforce that creates these products, must also mirror this gender mix.
I believe that companies, but not only, institutions too, have a key role in this.
Let&#39;s start with the institutions, with education: just as there are courses for children related to the world of information technology, but not only: MBAs, master classes, competitions dedicated to information technology, there should also be courses for the world of blockchain and technology.
I want to tell you about this episode, which is nice and, as fate would have it, it happened to me the other night while I was writing this speech, and so I said: I have to tell it.
There was a television program in the background, &quot;Girls&#39; TV,&quot; and there was Amalia Ercoli Finzi, who I discovered was the first Italian woman with a degree in space engineering, who told me something very simple and very interesting .
He said: girls should be given a Meccano and a doll.
But not because all little girls have to become engineers: that&#39;s not going to happen.
But if even one of them wants to become an engineer, she must know that she can do it.
To tell you about this episode, I looked for the gender, the feminine declension of the word engineer.
And I discovered that there are some words that don&#39;t include the feminine gender: for example, the word surgeon, the word engineer, the word mayor, just think about it.
This is, let&#39;s say, the role that the institutions have, for example with regard to education: insert dedicated courses, and give girls the opportunity to discover this world, to get close to it right away.
And what is the role of companies?
Well, definitely, to expose their female leadership: let&#39;s show them, these women.
Let&#39;s get them interviewed, expose them to the media.
We show that behind the success of these companies there are women, young people, who have traveled all over the world, who have impressive resumes.
And on the other hand, the selection processes are undoubtedly changing.
This, in my opinion, is a very interesting research that HP has done.
Think that a woman applies for a role if she feels 100 percent in line with that role; a man applies to a position if he feels 60 percent fit for that role.
Imagine, in my fintech sector, how difficult it is: we combine finance and technology, which are two sectors par excellence, two male fields.
How difficult it is to attract viable female candidates, who can potentially make careers, may be instrumental in writing the blank canvas of this technology.
And the approach to the CV also changes.
The CV no longer becomes the backbone of the selection process, but it is up to the human resource to identify what is the appetite, the talent of that person, looking to find more, perhaps, in the &quot;soft skills&quot; than in the &quot;hard skills.&quot;
Maybe on the resume it has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, or blockchain - as in my case, it had nothing to do with it.
Or maybe in her spare time she is an investor, she is an investor in the world of cryptocurrencies, perhaps she has already inquired about her passion, her interest.
So this is what we, as companies, must set out to do.
What about us individuals?
What is our role?
Well, today I took you a little into my world, I told you about this reality which is made up of men and women.
Just think that I have had five bosses in all: three women and two men, one of which is black and homosexual.
And for me they are - I aspire to be like them: that is, they are not an inspiration, more.
What you can do, on the other hand, starting tomorrow each of you must start getting information: you don&#39;t necessarily have to apply, but start chewing the material, start understanding what it is about.
Maybe you find yourself passionate, maybe you start taking an active role and not just passively receiving this revolution when this happens in all of our lives.
Because it&#39;s going to happen, and it&#39;s going to have an even bigger, even deeper impact than what the Internet has had for 20 years now.
What I encourage everyone to do - if I had to say to a student who is fresh out of university, but also to you, I would say: take a backpack, shove a shirt in it and go to Asia, where this world is already very much on its way.
Start going to events, cocktail hours, meetups.
Begin to understand what it is.
And you&#39;re a bit like this little girl behind me, who throws herself, in total unconsciousness but also amused, into this new medium that she doesn&#39;t know, following her predisposition, in fact.
And he enjoys this adventure.
And that&#39;s exactly what I encourage you, and in short everyone, to do.
To do it now, in this moment.
Thank you.
(Applause)
﻿This is Juan, he is an indigenous Kaqchikel who lives in Guatemala.
An indigenous Mayan, Kaqchikel.
And like the vast majority of Kaqchikel indigenous people, he grows corn.
The Mayans believe they are made of corn.
Their god, Huracán, of the Popol Vuh, which is their sacred book, creates them right from corn dough.
So Juan, every year, before the dry season, sows corn.
Every year, he needs $500 to be able to buy the seeds, $600 which is to be able to buy the pesticides associated with those seeds, and $900 to be able to buy the fertilizers associated with those seeds.
They call it a “full tech package,” that&#39;s how they sell it to you.
A technology package that includes seeds, pesticides and fertilizers for the price of $2,000.
Obviously, Juan doesn&#39;t have the $2,000 and he has to go to the bank to get the $2,000.
When he finally delivers, sells the corn and has to return the money to the bank, it will have already become 2,400.
The problem is that when he goes to sell corn in Guatemala, there is a free trade agreement between Guatemala and the United States, whereby goods produced in Guatemala and the United States circulate freely between these two countries.
So when Juan goes to sell corn, he has to compete with corn produced in the United States, where it is produced that way.
Thanks to hyper-mechanized, industrialized agriculture and large-scale crops, in the United States they are able to produce corn at an infinitely lower price than what Juan produces.
The price per quintal of corn has dropped so much that Juan now sells it for 10 dollars a quintal: that&#39;s 10 cents a kilo.
But the year went well, Juan managed to produce 50 quintals of corn.
So he&#39;s going to make $5,000, which when you take off the $2,400 he has to pay back to the bank means $2,600 for the entire crop.
That&#39;s $220 a month.
However, Juan still keeps a part of that corn for himself, and he also has a small garden and a few chickens.
Thanks to all this he is able to guarantee himself, his wife and his three children 1,700 kcal a day.
These 1,700 kcal a day, which for us could be a perfect low-calorie diet to eat bacon for the summer, for Juan mean losing 1 kg a month, every month.
12 kg per year, every year.
It&#39;s called malnutrition.
In Guatemala, 22 families own 76% of the land.
9.5 million peasants share what&#39;s left.
The appreciations are so small that they can&#39;t produce who knows how much, and this makes Guatemala the tenth worst-fed country in the world.
2,244 kcal is the average in Guatemala.
Average.
These include the people in the cities, they include the scraps, the waste, they include the rich fat people who live in the cities and they include the millions of farmers who don&#39;t get to those fateful 2,000 calories, and never will.
According to the World Bank, 49.8% of Guatemalan children under five are malnourished.
Also according to this study by the World Bank, 72% of Guatemalan families last year had to sell assets in order to buy food.
Asset, this word used by the World Bank which to us may seem like an instrument of high finance, for a farmer, an asset means a hoe, a shovel, a plough.
It means selling work items in order to buy food.
So what does Juan do?
He sees a future, he sees something different.
He sees billboards advertising a crop that could guarantee him a lot more money, and it&#39;s sugar cane.
A US company produces biodiesel in Guatemala.
They would lend him $3,000 directly, so the debt is higher.
But that same company guarantees him that it will buy him corn at the end of the year, for $6,000.
Juan&#39;s income increases from 220 to 250 dollars a month.
Sounds like the business of the year.
Try it, Juan.
It throws itself on the sugar cane.
The problem is that at the end of the year he runs out of corn, and what seemed like a perfect business turns out to be a bust.
And so, from 1,700 its calories drop to 1,600.
No longer 12 kg a year, but 15.
He can&#39;t do it, he can&#39;t do it.
So what does it do?
He decides to sell his piece of land to the same company that will produce large-scale sugar cane, and then sell biodiesel.
He sells his piece of land for around $7,000.
It&#39;s a good piece of land, for Guatemala, in a fertile area, in the plains.
He also sells his house, [it&#39;s] about $6,000 what he gets on the house.
And then he goes back $10,000 in debt.
With these 23,000 dollars, he will pay a coyote, a trafficker in human beings, who will take him and take him across Mexico, on this train that is known throughout Latin America as &quot;The Beast&quot;: the train on which they travel , every day, thousands of migrants.
Who leave, who flee their countries to reach the United States.
Juan will travel in inhumane conditions for a month.
Clinging, sometimes tied up, for fear that if he falls asleep he will fall downstairs.
Then tied to this silo carrying exactly that biodiesel that was produced on his field.
Juan paid $23,000 to be smuggled from Guatemala to the United States.
Those 500,000 liters of biodiesel are transported for the price of $350.
Why am I telling you all this?
And why me?
Well, because I lived in Latin America, in Guatemala, for a long time.
And stories like Juan&#39;s I&#39;ve heard by the hundreds.
So one day I told myself that someone had to tell it, that someone had to come here and tell those stories.
However, to do that, I first had to deprive myself of something, I had to take something off, I had to take off this shield that we all have, this protection we have at birth, which is the most precious thing we have.
You will think, when one is born, one says to a newborn child: &quot;The important thing is health, the important thing is that he is well, the important thing is that he has money, that there is sun, that he is in a beautiful place, which has the love of the family”.
There is something far more important, something that is randomly assigned to you the moment you are born.
Something that cannot be touched, which is intangible, which we cannot see, but which we all have.
And that it is one of the most violent things ever invented: citizenship.
Citizenship represented by this stupid little brown booklet, which we all have.
When you&#39;re born, they give you one, it&#39;s a bit like winning the lottery.
I won, because mine says &quot;Republic of Italy&quot;.
I with this have access to the best education systems and the best health care systems.
With this, I can go to 173 countries without having to apply for a visa.
There are people like me who, however, have written “Republic of Syria” on this passport and are not going anywhere.
In 1853, the United States was to build the transpacific railroad, the one that runs, say, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
They had a problem, though: in the central United States, the Arizona area, it was all mountains.
And so they couldn&#39;t build the railway, in short, it was complicated, it was a mess.
So what did they do?
They went to Mexico, which was broke, like today, and bought him a piece of land.
The sale of the Mesilla.
Some gentlemen in Washington drew a straight line, like this, in the middle of the desert, because they needed the plain to build the railroad.
Today, the border passes through that straight line.
There&#39;s a city, in that straight line, there in the middle of that straight line, called Nogales.
Nogales is divided in two: if you were born there, you have a US passport.
You have access to the best schools.
to the best hospitals.
You have a passport that allows you to travel to 167 countries around the world.
If you&#39;re born here, you&#39;re Mexican, and you can&#39;t do anything with your passport.
Did you think health was important?
Passport is important.
And the passport is assigned to you, perhaps, for a straight line traced in Washington 160 years ago.
But I wanted to tell it, I wanted to experience it like them.
And to do that, I had to get rid of this passport.
So I put it in an envelope, and mailed it to a friend&#39;s house.
I disguised myself, transformed myself into a Peruvian migrant from the Amazon named Aymar Blanco.
I crossed the Suchiate River, which divides Mexico from Guatemala, and then I crossed all of Mexico.
Since 1994, Mexico has been collaborating with the United States in blocking illegal immigration.
Every year, the United States pours between 4 and 6 billion dollars into Mexico to make Mexico do the dirty work, which is to block Central and South American migrants.
So the border, by now, is no longer just the passage between Mexico and the United States.
The frontier is the whole of Mexico!
And Mexico never ends, it&#39;s very long, it&#39;s huge.
Depending on where you pass, it could be more than 4,000km.
Much of the journey is done clinging, stuck, sometimes tied like Juan to these freight trains.
Train that throughout America is known as &quot;The Beast&quot;, or the train of death.
Father Solalinde defined the train lines as &quot;the largest open-air cemetery in the world&quot;.
Every year thousands of people, perhaps falling asleep or distracted, fall off the train and end up sucked under the rails.
This train is the emblem of the modern world: a train that travels, a huge train, goods, which does not carry out passenger service, which travels non-stop from south to north carrying low-cost materials, but without carrying people.
Coal, iron, zinc, copper, machine parts, pieces of clothing, finished clothes, mangoes, papayas, bananas.
Everything travels freely without duties, without borders, without anything.
The only things traveling illegally on that train are human beings.
They kidnapped me three times on this trip.
A band of hooded men, in the middle of the desert, after having stolen everything from us, emptied our water.
They didn&#39;t know what to do with it anymore, and they emptied it before our eyes, just to make us go thirsty.
I had to run, escape, jump off the moving train over and over again, outrun pregnant women and elderly gentlemen, in order to escape.
I had to cover my ears and eyes, not to listen to the screams of those who didn&#39;t make it.
According to Amnesty International, 60% of women before reaching the United States are raped during this journey.
60%.
The federal police caught us, arrested us, locked us up in a cell measuring 4 meters by 4, 40 people.
Two days, with 40 degrees during the day, without water, without food, without a bath.
40 people: we had to take turns, to be seated.
Not lying down, sitting down.
There was no possibility of everyone sitting down, we took turns: some sitting, some standing.
For two days in a row.
Forced to eat, drink, shit, piss, vomit, pass out, all within this space.
Suddenly the train wasn&#39;t there, it had been carried away by the rains, and then there was a replacement service made with trucks.
And we spent 26 hours hidden in the false bottom of a truck.
By the time we finished, our joints were so stiff that we fell flat on our faces in the mud when we got off the truck.
Our carriers laughed and drank tequila.
Nonetheless, driven by desperation, thousands of people make this journey every year and arrive at the border with the United States, and I with them.
We could basically divide the border with the United States into three.
You arrive, you have crossed all of Mexico but you still have to cross the border, you still have to get to the coveted United States.
The easternmost part is the only part where there is really a natural border, which is the Río Bravo, which by the way is a river with a funny name because in the United States it is called the Río Grande del Sur, the Great River of the South.
In Mexico it is called the Río Bravo, the bad river.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people drown each year trying to cross it.
The current carries them out to sea and then there the currents of the Gulf of Mexico make fun of them, and carry them to Texas, but dead.
The seven counties on the south coast of Texas have been in a health emergency since 2008 due to the number of deaths that wash up on their coasts every day.
To the west, then, there is the wall: 1,223 km, the second largest separation barrier ever built by human beings.
In the 20 years of that wall, 3,040 people have already died, according to official US estimates.
To give you a comparison, in the 28 years of existence of the Berlin Wall there were 98 dead.
We&#39;re talking 3,040 here, officers.
In Mexico, estimates speak of 15,000.
Then, in the middle, there&#39;s nothing, there&#39;s a gap.
What else do you have to add, in addition to the Sonora desert, a desert one third the size of Italy with temperatures that exceed 40 degrees during the day and -10 at night.
Pima County, just across the border, filed for bankruptcy in 2013.
He was no longer able to pay the electricity bill, to keep the refrigerators that stored 871 unidentified bodies of migrants who died in an attempt to cross the desert.
That&#39;s where I went from.
We walk at night, in the cold, we hide during the day, in atrocious heat.
Groups of &quot;American patriots&quot;, from the United States, poison wells: one night we found a poisoned well, I was sick.
I owe my life to a Nicaraguan migrant whose name I don&#39;t even know.
While I was behind a cactus that I was throwing up, he grabbed me by the shoulder and said: “Oh, look, they&#39;re leaving you here.
You have to move.&quot;
Not everyone has a Nicaraguan guardian angel.
24 of us left and 19 arrived in Tucson.
Today, across that desert we want to expand, build yet another wall: a further barrier of separation between two countries, a further barrier that wants to prevent human beings from doing the most natural thing they can do: move, move.
We were apes 3.5 million years ago.
We came down from the trees to move.
We assumed the upright, bipedal position to be able to walk long distances, to be able to move around.
The history of the human being is made up of innumerable movements, innumerable migrations and movements from one place to another, in search of food, in search of partners.
Then we return, we flee from catastrophes.
The human being moves.
Babies learn to walk before they actually use their hands.
Children walk before they speak.
They learn to walk before eating solid foods.
Human beings are made to walk.
And no wall, no barrier in the world, however large they may build, no barrier in the world will ever prevent human beings from moving and moving.
Thank you.
(Applause) [Roots are important in a man&#39;s life, but we men have legs, not roots, and legs are made to go elsewhere - Pino Cacucci]
Today we talk about the future, young people, technology, but also about tradition, know-how, art and beauty.
Today I&#39;m taking you to the factory, and I&#39;m telling you about that extraordinary opportunity that lies on the frontier between mechanics and digital.
It was the early 80s, and I remember when I went to the workshop with my dad on Saturday mornings.
It was a mechanical workshop, or rather an engineering one.
And they built very complicated parts for the textile and aeronautical industries.
As we walked through the workshop, I remember a dark environment, a strong smell of oil, my father running left and right to give instructions to anyone he met.
I remember men with big strong hands, busy, with their heads inside the cars, inside their dark overalls.
I also remember great order and cleanliness – my father always cared a lot about order.
I remember very precise mechanical details: they looked like jewels, works of art: know-how.
Let&#39;s leap forward, we are in 2017, we are in what is now called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0.
It is a phase of history which is characterized by less defined and broader boundaries than the previous ones.
Let&#39;s review them together.
The first: 18th century, the introduction of steam power for the operation of productive machines.
The second, early 20th century, electricity, chemical, petroleum, mass production and assembly lines - Ford.
The third, early 70s: electronics, computers, the first robots, factory automations.
This fourth is instead substantially characterized by a connection between the physical system and the digital system.
And it is very different from the previous ones for at least five reasons.
The first, the speed: while the first took about 80 years to reach its full impact, the second 50, the third 30, the fourth is hitting us like a tsunami.
Multidimensionality, breadth: it&#39;s not just about single technological dimensions, but many in acceleration and in combination with each other.
It&#39;s not just about processes inside factories, but it&#39;s increasingly about products, supply chains, business models – everything is interconnected.
Democratization: the cost of accessing these technologies drops dramatically, so it is no longer reserved only for large companies but for an ever wider public.
Human capital is at the heart of this fourth revolution, much more than it was in the first three.
It is a cultural revolution, even before a technological one.
The mechanical sector, like all the others, is not free from this great challenge and this great transformation.
Despite the great crisis that has hit the whole world, mechanics remains the pillar of Italian industry, an Italy that remains the second manufacturing country in Europe, and the fifth for added value in the world.
Mechanics alone accounts for 48% of Italian exports and 82% of high and medium-high technology production.
We mechanics feel at the center of this fourth transformation by observing a growing convergence between mechanics, digital and electronics.
Not only in processes, but increasingly in products.
The product of this convergence is what we call mechatronics.
This convergence will lead to 26 billion connected objects in 2020.
Increasingly intelligent products, designed to simplify our lives, to make it safer, which once on the market learn, collect an enormous amount of data, feel and react.
How to do it, how does the way of doing business change in this context?
We in the company manufacture products to move and dose fluids with great precision and accuracy, and given this growing complexity we started asking ourselves this question several years ago.
In 2013 we created a completely separate place, a separate company, a knowledge enterprise where designers and engineers work together on the future.
It is a group of people who place themselves at the center of a network of excellence made up of universities, research centres, experts and technological partners.
Working in an open way, acting and working as architects of innovation, combining technologies, people, knowledge.
This product is an example of the result of the work.
And it is a valve, a device to divert a flow, for use in the medical field – the extraordinary nature of this object lies in the fact that it has been entirely not only designed but also tested on the computer, through hundreds and hundreds of repeated simulations, which has been delegated the task of identifying and examining the highest possible number of configurations, of geometries, to identify the best possible according to an objective function.
The result was then created through 3D printing, it was combined with a shape memory actuator, an intelligent material that serves as a sensor and also as an actuator, therefore as a motor.
All of this is a connected product, part of those 26 billion objects capable of feeling, learning and reacting according to predefined rules.
These objects are then made in increasingly modern, connected factories, where the personnel is highly qualified, without gender barriers - no longer, they design and govern complex machines that create the same extremely precise mechanical details of which I have a childhood memory - today, mechatronics .
But while all this is happening, while we ride this wave with great dedication and passion, let me go back for a moment: it was 2015, it was a Sunday morning, at home, with my three children, then aged 11, 9 and 6 and I spoke, as had happened on other occasions, of papa&#39;s work, of the factory, of mechanics, of all this great transformation.
It wasn&#39;t the first time, but this time it was particularly painful for me not to see my own enthusiasm in their eyes, and I began to wonder why.
This fascinating transformation that we experience every day, this digital convergence, for our kids, but [also] for families, for public opinion, are distant, unknown.
There is a dramatic gap between reality and perception.
Well, we in industry have never been famous for our ability to tell stories: historically we prefer to do rather than tell.
I realized, in front of the eyes of my boys, that we were missing out on an important opportunity by standing by as this gap grows.
Industry is where the most extraordinary transformations of our time are taking place.
And we have to be able to tell this to our kids.
In a new way, with new words.
A sense of social responsibility was triggered in me, primarily towards my boys but towards young people, towards industry, towards the country, because I realized that we were playing a lot.
So, like a good engineer, I decided to verify this feeling of mine with data.
Involving the industrial association, we carried out an analysis of the perception from which it clearly emerged that the word engineering, which still distinguishes our sector, was still associated with words such as: iron; blue overalls; mass production; Assembly line; dirty; fatigue; oil.
It looked like an image from Charlie Chaplin&#39;s film &quot;Modern Times&quot;.
We are talking about the thirties.
The companies, the people who point to the future, the protagonists of this transformation, are absolutely not associated with these words, if anything with: technology; precision; electronics; digital; mechanics; future.
All words, these, associated instead with the term “mechatronics”.
And so it was from here that we started with a project to reposition the sector, to make it the first choice for our young people.
Promoting a cultural change, completely rethinking our way of telling ourselves.
And so we started by simply changing the name, from metalworkers to mechatronics, metalworkers for which we were always known.
And then we created an image, a new identity that should tell us in a simple way, speak to everyone.
Then we went to the schools, where we involved young people with the &quot;business director&quot; competition to tell this new world of factories through their eyes, through cinema.
We have involved the &quot;Advertising Progress&quot; foundation to go and tell about this new change, also social, of work and the factory.
And then we went to the theater, to the Strehler Theater in Milan where we talked about this change with the show “The Importance of Being Mechatronics”. We talked about it by talking about young people, the future, but also about art and beauty.
Yes, because the products we make are beautiful, because they are generated by a way of designing that has beauty as the indispensable quality of making.
And then we brought this project, and we are bringing this project, to a national scale, because obviously this is not just a Milanese problem, or a Lombard problem.
But let&#39;s go back to our young people, because it has been said that 65% of our kids who enter elementary school today will do jobs that don&#39;t exist today.
And if we want the future that I have told you about today to be sustainable, we will have to be able to involve them, inspire them, bring these kids inside.
Today, however, we are starting from a situation in which in Italy, [there is] 65% difficulty in finding young people with training in technical-scientific disciplines.
On the other hand, however, we are told that we have 35% youth unemployment.
It is paradoxical, we are talking about two worlds that do not speak to each other.
But why do our kids and our families make choices, choose paths without perspective?
Are they aware of it?
Or they choose, they deliberately make mistakes because they see this world so distant, difficult, complex and for which they choose, they make choices that are only apparently simpler.
Robots don&#39;t steal our jobs, but inadequate education.
On the one hand, the scholastic model has not adapted to our times at all.
In this context, multidisciplinarity and the ability to move in complex scenarios are fundamental; creativity and ability to solve problems are crucial.
And at school you see very little of all this.
The school should make known and experience the most relevant technologies of our time: I&#39;m talking about blockchain, programming, Internet Of Things, Big Data, robotics, intelligent materials, Artificial Intelligence.
And I could go on.
And all this together, of course, with art, literature, mathematics.
The school should be the laboratory of the future.
It should be a stepping stone towards the future.
And then, training must be felt and experienced more and more as an individual responsibility, of young and old alike, because today we have the tools and we can&#39;t always wait for someone else to solve the problem for us.
And we entrepreneurs must take responsibility for our role, we must have the ability to convey the vision, the opportunity and the soul of this work.
We have to get out of businesses and we have to go to schools.
I do it as soon as I have the opportunity, and I assure you: I go out with the aim of inspiring young people and I come back inspired, because they are open, they are ready; it&#39;s up to us.
And we must also do this as informed, curious, aware parents.
And if I still haven&#39;t convinced you, come and visit our factories.
Come with your kids.
And come not only to the factories, but to all those places where the future is being planned: I&#39;m talking about incubators, business accelerators.
I&#39;m talking about university laboratories, I&#39;m talking about research centres.
Today Italy seems to have lost sight: our young people are not taking risks, they seem to have given up.
But I don&#39;t want to believe it.
Italy is a country with very deep industrial roots.
A very fertile ground made up of extraordinary brains, passion, tradition and creativity.
Of a capacity for combinatorial innovation that the whole world envies us.
Let&#39;s not throw all this away, letting our kids get lost chasing paths with no future.
Nelson Mandela said: &quot;A winner is simply a dreamer who never gave up&quot;.
And if we want our boys to win again, we must first of all go back to inspiring them and making them dream.
(Applause)
Some of the most attentive spectators could guess that they are in this area.
Let&#39;s keep a low profile!
So, I am a healthy bearer of optimism and I like challenges, in fact when they told me to choose where I wanted to talk about optimism, whether in Silicon Valley or in Rovigo, Polesine, Italy, I had no doubts, because it can also be provocative to talk about optimism in this period.
In reality, what we believe to be this time is very important and the vision we have of the future is very important.
Why does the future have a lot to do with it?
The future has something to do with it because it depends on how you see your future, because the actions you take in the present spring from that vision, think for example when we choose a course of study: the first thing we think is: &quot;It will be useful when I&#39;ll finish?
Will it help me find work?
Will it help me have a better life?” So it is very important that we are aware of what we are experiencing, if the phrase that &quot;we are living in the best era in the history of humanity&quot; is true, not in the last 50-100 years of humanity.
I&#39;m passionate about coaching, I know many coaches, but it was all invented by this one here: Socrates was the only real coach, what do we do after us?
We make slides by changing the things he said, but the reasoning is his and the claim is simply to make people think.
Make you think to maybe have a different view.
First, let&#39;s clear up a possible misunderstanding: I&#39;m not angry with the pessimists.
Pessimists and optimists make their contribution to the world.
If for the optimists we had the plane for someone who dreamed of flying, the pessimists invented the parachute, it is essential that they entered it.
Then it&#39;s true that if you jump with a parachute you have to be optimistic, because afterwards… oh well, let&#39;s not enter a tour that never ends.
What is our worldview?
If we look at the world as we have always seen it, perhaps in a geographical map, what is the idea we have of this world?
With what eyes are we looking at it?
Maybe someone here in the room, an expert in cartography, geography, will know that this geographical map is not exactly correct, it somewhat reflects the area where the first maps were built, in fact some continents do not have a dimension consistent with the one they actually have in the reality.
There is a map, it is called the Peters map, which represents in a more faithful way what is the size of the individual continents.
In this map that you see behind me, can you see Italy?
Even those of the lodge who have paid little?
Can you see it, even above?
Oh well, those who can&#39;t see, zoom in… And now?
Well, we need a few more seconds.
Have you found it?
Well there&#39;s Italy, it&#39;s just filmed.
This map is upside down, but in reality this map is the map that primary school pupils of Australia have in their schoolbooks.
So who&#39;s legs up?
The kangaroos or us?
Neither them nor us, but it&#39;s the different view.
If we detach ourselves a little from our usual way of seeing things, perhaps we are able to grasp some aspects that might escape us.
We are experiencing a revolution.
If it is true that there have been many revolutions, many revolutions in the world, the industrial revolution, think of the first industrial revolution: the end of the seventeenth century, the steam engine, the loom, which completely changed not only the production processes but also the interpersonal relationships, the very structure of society.
Two centuries later another revolution, called the second industrial revolution with the advent of the assembly line, with extensive use of electricity, which changed further, creating trauma, creating fractures and then subsequent well-being.
Think of the third industrial revolution that we have practically all experienced, with the advent of the Internet, and then the last one we are experiencing now, which many define as the fourth industrial revolution, where we talk about genetics and that capital E is not a typographical error , is the sense of new problems that we will have to face.
Do you think that Google at the moment is not only hiring computer engineers, it is hiring philosophers, to understand where the world that awaits us will go.
There is talk of 3D printing, of different connection speeds.
When we have a revolution, the first reaction is always fear: I remember my grandmother with the first cordless phone, it was a phone that no longer had a cord, she was worried: &quot;If the words aren&#39;t in there, where do they go?&quot; Changes worry, even the smallest ones.
An economist wrote, I would like to read it with you, “We are suffering from a bout of pessimism.
We have known faster progress in the last decade than in all previous history.
The rapidity of technical change produces problems that are difficult to solve, the countries that suffer the most are those that are not at the forefront of technical progress.
We are struck by a new malaise: technological unemployment.
A form of unemployment caused by the fact that we discover new ways to save labor faster than we discover new ways to employ labor.
This could be an article from today, but it was written in 1930.
And I need not tell you what has happened in the decades since 1930.
It is just to make you understand how much a change can, if not correctly interpreted, if not framed in a correct vision, create fears, create fears, often unfounded.
One, the classic, is that sooner or later progress will end.
This is the thesis obviously supported by the pessimists, those of the parachute, sooner or later progress will end.
In reality, however, we must think of progress as something that accumulates, does not run out, is added to discovered things, inventions, skills that we had before, it is something that adds up, not that it ends.
Obviously, we can then divide progress into the various areas of life and therefore we see that there are different rhythms.
If technological progress is before everyone&#39;s eyes, as if it had a very steep curve, progress at the social level, not to mention the progress of the last line at the political level, is slower, because this is precisely the characteristic of this era.
The characteristic of this era is speed.
The changes are so rapid that our brain has a hard time interpreting them, it has a hard time realizing them, and for this reason we think that sometimes things cannot change quickly for the better.
In reality, technological progress is offering us incredible solutions for everyone&#39;s well-being.
There are thousands of examples, see for example the chart of the cost of mapping the human genome: $100 million to do a mapping of the human genome in the 2000s.
100 million dollars, only the 2-3 richest people in the world could afford.
A few years later it goes down, and it goes down with a very optimistic forecast that followed Moore&#39;s law, which is what tells us that the capabilities of microprocessors double every year.
So it was a very positive projection, &quot;We will soon get from 100 million to 10 million&quot;, it means that instead of the two richest in the world, many millionaires will be able to afford it.
And then an incredible thing happens, not foreseen even by the most optimistic scientists: that this price drops very quickly and today mapping, which cost 100 million dollars a few years ago, today costs less than a tablet, is within the reach of many people .
What happened?
It happened that the studies of Frederick Sanger, one of the pioneers in this area, the fourth person in the world to win a Nobel for chemistry, were put online.
So we went from a series of concentrated intelligences, 5, 10, 15 researchers locked up in a laboratory to 5, 10, 15, 50,000 researchers around the world, and this accelerated the reasoning ability on this problem, bringing very cheaper and affordable for everyone.
For example, one of the extraordinary characteristics that this future that we will soon live will have will be an absolutely transparent world.
I know it is provocative to talk about transparency here, but that will be the case.
This is a bus stop in Singapore.
With cigarette butts taken from the ground, the profiles of the people who had thrown them were reconstructed with DNA traces.
From this profile, people take the picture, put it on the bus stop, &quot;If you see this filth, tell him they don&#39;t throw their butts on the ground&quot;.
This is the transparency that we are seeing in so many things, even in politics, in communication, as we said before, it cannot be deleted from the internet and it becomes transparent, a world where we have control and are increasingly protagonists.
Of course it is difficult to perceive this, because if we see that there are taxi strikes in Rome or Milan, perhaps we have not seen that in July the first drone taxi was inaugurated in Dubai, which travels alone and is maneuvered with a joystick .
And he said: &quot;But I would never go up there&quot;, it&#39;s the same thing we said the first time we went on a plane.
We will go there, because it will work.
There are paradoxical aspects, perhaps we can think that today&#39;s characteristic, the great progress is that we have generations of people glued to a smartphone screen, and it is true that in China and now also in Belgium they have made lanes on the sidewalks for people who is chatting.
One could even say: “But this progress does not seem so intelligent to me”.
In reality, there are things behind these advances that should make us think, for example when we talk about 5G.
We are thinking, those who have 4G, “Oh well, what will 5G be?
It will be a slightly faster connection, for example I will be able to download a film --legally I mean-- so when I have paid for it, 1 gigabyte I will be able to download it in 7-8 seconds.
A real wonder!&quot;.
It&#39;s actually not just that, because this changes you an evening when you don&#39;t know what to do at home.
In reality, the 5G networks will have a wider and more powerful capacity than optical fiber, they will finally allow automatic driving in cars, they will allow remote operation with even greater ease and with even greater precision, the Internet of things will be a reality because these objects will be able to interact with each other at speeds that are unthinkable today.
And so I say that if you&#39;re not optimistic, with everything we have, it&#39;s probably because you lack data.
Today the irrational person, who looks to the future, is the pessimist.
And what do we teach our children?
What can we teach our children if statistics and research tell us that 65% of primary school pupils will do a job that doesn&#39;t exist today?
What can we teach him?
I believe we can teach them, and we too can learn, to be better people, people who define themselves as optimistic, or those people who transmit positive energy, they have common characteristics and I would like to briefly analyze them with you.
Above all they are honest people, and it&#39;s a revolutionary word in this era, they are normal people, it&#39;s not like an optimist has a paresis.
No!
It has its positive moments and its negative moments, it is the different vision.
It&#39;s true that they smile often, optimistic people smile often, then they have the ability to share their good mood with other people, they never stop making plans.
Whether they&#39;re 20, 30, 70, they don&#39;t stop making plans.
They have a unique and extraordinary feature: they emphasize positive things.
We all have negative things in our lives and probably if we make a list they will come out right away.
And the positive things, how long would it take us to make a list of positive things in our life?
But if you have a parent, a child, a friend who loves you, a hospital within a radius of 50 km, electricity, drinking water, these are things that shouldn&#39;t be taken for granted.
I understand that one shouldn&#39;t go home, turn on the tap and say: &quot;Long live the company of aqueducts!&quot;.
It would be excessive, but you have to realize that this makes you a lucky person.
People who transmit positive energy are generous people who help others, we can teach this and we can practice this.
They have no prejudices nor are they afraid to convey, to show their affection.
So, perhaps being optimistic today is simply one thing: it is returning to believing in people, but not because man is capable of creating a 5G network or because he is capable of transporting passengers with a drone, because man is capable of the most wonderful thing that ever appeared on this Earth: another human being.
And a person who has this ability cannot fail to make you think positively about the future.
So how do I change the world?
There are many who want to change the world, few think about how to change themselves.
I believe that if you really want to change the world, it&#39;s simply a matter of being the best version of yourself.
Thank you
