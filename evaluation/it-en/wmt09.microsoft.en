The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored its losses.
CEZ stock transactions reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before which was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, here too, there is a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Stock crash in Asia
Asian stock stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indices erased some of the losses later during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index erased nearly 4% during the day, but later also a portion of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were down more than 5%, but in the end the losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the bailout is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," noted Hong Kong Currency Bureau chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, therefore without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer the consequences.
Massacre of American actions
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech crowns) were to be allocated.
Lawmakers ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a massacre on Monday, and major stock indices posted their biggest slump in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones index has fallen by almost 7% and a similar collapse was last seen in 1987.
The index was already lowered before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has relented: the US government can give $700 billion to the banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an arrangement of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will take place early next week.
American lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout in the form of economic aid for the American financial system totaling 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
Congressional representatives, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the territory of the House of Representatives.
The chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters on Sunday.
In the Senate, according to some sources, a vote on the plan could probably not be voted on until Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Subsequently, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to achieve the help of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our differing views regarding the form of presenting the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers' delegates met on Saturday night with U.S. Finance Secretary Henry Paulson to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
"We are at the completion of the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market".
"We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is falling heavily on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final deal in Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first to influence Monday's market following Congress' decision.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two houses of the US Congress will vote on the law and even if the negotiations can stop at the last moment on some problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the scheme should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can overwhelm its veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has been maintained, namely to obtain the finances to buy passive mortgage values, the price of which has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's positive performance and appreciated "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget of reductions, splitting the financial plan.
The new law is also supposed to limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program, and is creating a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a big step towards the deal that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government is expected to negotiate the new mortgage instalments it buys with the aim of lowering monthly charges for debtors' installments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief bursar of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price problematic assets will be bought.
This will determine how the losses are divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the website iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, that crucial.
"Much more important, is that already this week the representatives of the congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten sub-prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the vote, but it loses 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was for the ÖVP, which lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in post-war Austrian history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the People's Party, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advantage in the preferences ahead of the SPÖ.
But voters evidently punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% early and the BZÖ 11% of the vote - but the Social Democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even a reason for sanctions by the European Union.
Haider is evidently playing on this development, having already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the Parliament, but fell slightly, falling from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has evidently exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Duel to the death: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons to get a self-reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LPs and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
But if on your shelves are crowded vinyls of hard-rock, jazz or blues probably, such a turntable at least you dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the twenty-crown headphones on the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life decides.
Some high-quality music players can do more than just read music, which phones don't even accidentally.
There is no other device as universal today as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone calls and text messages, can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even browse.
And if we take into account smartphones and PDAs you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle since no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile phone and the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, do not count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add a few calls from time to time, get another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you will not have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem exists when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to cope without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their own media library sorted by performers' names, album name, genre or user classification.
Some devices only mimic the folder tree, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in battery strength, memory capacity, the quality and type of audio outputs and, of course, ease of use.
If you need music mainly as background music and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need any mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is now, clearly true of any mobile phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which formats your phone or player recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format, which belongs to the most popular ones, the majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by the Apple company and its Ipod).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile phone-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
Prices are not really very low.
But it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile phones with them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little bit rummage through your pocket while your MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile phone readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an input for common headphones.
The best and technically more equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, among others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) can really anyone handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping into the start of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which appliance to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (such as M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which are included in the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and also want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners preferably take specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual buttons for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has come a long way in this area, as mobile phones in the Walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Perhaps it will not be missing for a long time.
We have already written about the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe many times on Mobil.cz.
After all, this was also confirmed by ČTÚ, pointing out that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission's latest steps in the field of regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high vis-à-vis Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the clash.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage well above 100 %.
Mobile telophony operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities. (After all, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is still another possibility – the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant drop in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices were ringing out in Britain.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
At the end of the day, we don't have to go very far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, to which U:fon belongs in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to actually work, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them, that is to say, relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators are usually at low cost, offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the narrower service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that costs at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on a target group can also be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men, so to speak.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz, CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small due to a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Plus, from a service point of view, it's relatively saturated."
No chance in Czech Republic, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever to be an operator in the Czech Republic, Mobilking will not be.
"There is talk of expanding this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
The lighting of Mobilking will rather take place in the other countries in our area," Jana Studničková, the press spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation for Mobile.cz.
Thus he indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thinking.
Rather, on the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them," says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
From unofficial information it emerges that we will have to have the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, an impenetrable wall of silence stands around its creation.
"Right now we don't believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now, no person with a complex and serious project has approached us," Vlastimil Sršeň of Telefònika O2's press section mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial commercial project on which we can continue to build."
He adds: "A virtual operator is unlikely to appear in the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
At this moment we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its 3G license demands.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the creation U:fon testify that when operators care about one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing on ČTÚ at the time of the creation of U:fon towards the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by the information publicly accessible from the ČTÚ web pages.
But now U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has just been strengthened with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and above all on his services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephone operators is quite surprising in the complete disinterest of Czech regulators.
It is not just a question of the attitude of the ČTÚ which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer from potential buyers has probably not been attractive enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the ÚOHS External Relations Section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
On the other hand, on the part of the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and, moreover, to ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the lowering of prices for mobile phone services."
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises by itself.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations is undoubtedly the result of coincidence and the fight against competition.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking in the telecoms regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is the analysis of relevant markets prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the agreement of the network operator is always required for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – logically at the end of the day – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators proceed in such an eerily similar way.
At the same time complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all traders they encounter very similar obstacles.
Shifting responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS keeps out of the whole thing.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve from this.
The representatives of ÚOHS must know this fact more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one is watching
While without us noticing it, the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only predetermined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator is a classic corporate customer, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives offers of special prices (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about, which we will look into, arise, it could be a violation of contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied to the question in question.
But it is highly unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time against such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a considerable profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot dispose of it in full like regular customers of mobile operators."
But this should be a little strange at ČTÚ.
In addition, another question opens up for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to it it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we will no longer be expensive
As has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the operators were born, the traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, at least too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries, it is precisely in these cases that regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then the first virtual operator was created and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw themselves from one to the other like a hot potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competences in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let us not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator really soon appears with us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, ÚOHS could hardly remain impassive to the refusal (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj" on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State.
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The singing is conducted by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
Already earlier he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the solo variants, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to make sure that both and also the choir, have clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175^ anniversary.
The song "Kde domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, tramway and bus instead of the paper ticket with an electronic card in their pocket.
Right now about one hundred thousand people who have their own Opencard can get it.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual metro station (which will be valid from the first of January 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be purchased since yesterday on the internet at the page of the Compagnia dei Trasporti www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet service can completely forget about the counters in the metro stops where until now they had to queue for paper tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a counter with trained staff who will help those interested in purchasing on the internet and will also record the credit acquired on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to load electronic coupons on Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the metro entrances.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, resemble ticket validators, and passengers have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stops.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will load on it.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 up to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to integrated transport in Prague, there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the temporal and zonal validity," explained the Filip ticket control method from the Ropid organization, which develops the timetables of Prague collective transport.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver's cash register.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition it is necessary to place the Opencard at the specific point next to the cash desk.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and do not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can again go to self-service ATMs, where they load the coupons on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
Sudeten Germans in 1945 demanded to include Šumava in the United States.
This is apparent from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is also apparent from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the "district of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter signed with the words "The people who care about the fate of Šumava with all their hearts."
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives Sudeten Germans hope only to brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to assume the control over Shumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing or nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the willingness of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the mastery of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naïve with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it aptly describes the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to guess that it would be their displacement from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility altogether.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a Budějovice German in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in the prison camp in Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans visited him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, the Czech would suit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war were counting on the Beneš decrees to be moved from the Republic.
You don't think -you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček expects this to deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before leaving.
He wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people that will affect emotions.
And this is also testified by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think -you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you will pay".
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The commercials will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic scenes of accident victims can commonly be seen.
This promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Ministry of Transport psychologist Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative publicity, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the signs that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of the danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the Palestinians the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any restitution would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want bulldozers or levelers to pass over him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical sites," which are inside the Old City. .
"Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the permanent support they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem cannot be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal harvesting of beetles in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there will be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it is not resolved, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive branch can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher body.
Then he can ask for bail and wait for the sentence at liberty.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to the Major Court and then it will be possible to obtain a pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to give the convicts "competent legal support", the Indian minister argued.
At the same time he said that such support is already being lent by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
Even the Indians admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got a promise from the Indian side to deal with it.
"I got relatively many promises," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus stewards illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus of the company Student Agency came up the question whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week's accident in which a 22-year-old stewardess lost her life. years was caused by a truck that cut the way to the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting at that time next to the driver on the less safe seat of the bus, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus has standing places according to the vehicle registration document.
If it is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing places, the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed to the website Aktuálnĕ.cz.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at first it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the toilet during the ride if they have their assigned seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prevents the carrier from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and obligations are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law cures this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing places.
That's all," he says.
Categorize buses into urban buses where there are standing places and the maximum limited speed, intercity buses with standing places with higher maximum speed and long-distance without standing places with the maximum permitted speed and seats with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet ride there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even there it is not safe when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can bang his head."
"If the bus brakes abruptly, of course the laws of physics apply.
Equally as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers steward services.
This one takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their job dangerous.
"As soon as I feel like I have to consider the profession of steward as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce expenses," he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, cited the absence of stewards on his vehicles as an interest in safety.
"We have no hostesses, we oppose it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the accident on the line to Naples, a young stewardess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the coach tried to avoid him with a sharp maneuver, but hit him with the right front.
Jančura denies the fact that the two places reserved for the rest of the stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are non-transferable."
The company plans to sue the driver of the lorry.
The agency will not wait for the Court's ruling to pay damages to the girl's family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results though.
They don't consider them so much the coaches, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the motorway and mobile phone use while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Havelka, who is responsible for monitoring the safety of buses with the police and security offices.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
He approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer and director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposition and occasionally adds something.
The desire to work and enthusiasm dominate.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find petroleum, metallic minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms known until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states began to pay attention to underwater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, that is, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
That has according to the convention an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In a nutshell, by continental shelf we mean that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits before the commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical-professional help.
The committee has so far dealt with 5 requests namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has seen worldwide resonance.
But New Zealand has also gained - the area of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will yield him in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their demands.
They can do this for ten years since the "UNCLOS Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the area of the ocean floor that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No state here now has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, as well as investors from a few other states, it acquired the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean stretching between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonian division Rober Sandev brings a find with him to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary schem, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
Düsseldorf's hopes set on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the director of WestLB addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" could be formed through the meeting of units of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent bloc" with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Moreover, such a combination could be a decisive push for further links in the Länder banking sector.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under severe pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Service, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite a while, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, told the presentation of the turnover for the first half of the year that a merger of the house on Mainz Street with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB does not make sense.
However, Deka's board member, half of whom is brought in by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to hold talks with West LB on joint trading.
This could be market trading or parts thereof.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important in the business market in Frankfurt, it is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 for a short time it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing came of this three-way association.
As soon as the plans were published, the Hessian Regional Bank opposed Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutes also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always often thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba's board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his house.
That aside, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary for the different houses of the public sector to come together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
For Helaba, this is not entirely good news.
If the pressure for more mergers increases, partners will gradually be lacking.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has weathered the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings bank association, which participates with 85% of Helaba, put the deadlock on the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasoning are just one thing.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question of what business model would ensure the future of regional banks would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which is of course not desired by that.
Thus the letter from the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and demonstrates to the 200 or so travelers what are the deep tones that it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four buses with destination Monaco, Beer Festival ", arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated overnight.
It's so noisy, Marco says, it's not something for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with false fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver slats belong to the buses.
For 5 years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
The outward journey at night, during the day to the party, return at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian authenticity, the health insurance and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There is no beer yet.
Suddenly silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better this way, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!", Marco quotes early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow berets sitting on the same benches, divide in the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 euros, shouts Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 22.30 on time we meet here again! Understood?"
It's already off to the party.
On the street you stick yellow berets to trees, road signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian People's Party as you follow away.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "weekend of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, there is talk of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police is reinforced with 7 South Tyrolean agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments ahead of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also hinted that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis began at the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noticed in the DAX, obtains a billionaire loan from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would be up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper article, the state lender has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% to 2.37 million euros, the share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, earnings from increases in both applications and certain shares and the settlement of provisions in loans fell by more than 70% to 5 million. of Euro.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the restitution of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the consolidated text of tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were spun off into the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in classic state financing was too low, the DEPFA engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been written off.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financier of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer fiduciary deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the granting of credit between banks has largely dried up, as banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs part of the DEPFA credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – in the short term, the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs have been covered by credit for a certain period and the company has been protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources we hear, that thanks to the money the refinancing is assured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE steering committee, Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group would not need money markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Board (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still assured.
This is hopefully for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the financing will not be used completely.
But even the opposite is not to be excluded.
After the bank was reportedly about to fail on Sunday evening, the momentary bailout failed to calm the spirits.
The share price fell by 75% to 3.30 Euro.
Mortgage prices hold up quite well.
While the debts of the previous degree are almost immovable, they give up the prices of subordinated claims.
The mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are particularly affected, understandably starting beyond 2009.
Before HRE mortgages seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and of the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa has collapsed the crisis, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the least damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, annuities can be expected to be amortized within the deadline.
Or it comes into play, what no one dares to hope for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But when it comes to information overturned due to partial nationalizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create some sleepless nights for long-term investors with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors can complete the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains countervailing tax.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany in freeing the hostages – experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
We are receiving more and more detailed information about the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 kidnapped European hostages.
The rescue operation is mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior and German special units.
In addition to army specialists, GSG9 units, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as logistics experts from the technical institution were present on site.
As the spokesman of the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages and fled.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"Fortunately, we didn't get there," says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
On September 19, attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After being kidnapped in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained secret until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those released in the meantime have arrived in Cairo in good condition.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It was not explained on the details of the release.
In Berlin there had been no information, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should leave in flight with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to show up at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I even had a fifa to go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road alone and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as well as in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until at 8.40 a brief interview with the teacher begins, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
Meanwhile, I'm not the type to speak willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the desk and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and gestured and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I quickly ran to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class hour had continued quietly, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the truest sense of the word.
Everything spoke messily and giggled and annoyed me with questions – then it is really difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother even made me the basket for the Lunch - it's different from boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu ..
Actually, I don't even know what exactly I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a whole new flavor.
The fact is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the salted plums, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-made Bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of getting to know the boy during recess.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" My friends asked me when I told me that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I have always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas fervently for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning a little bit of the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I was coming once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and traditions.
Here they care a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and the latest trends – on the other side: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have never seen in my life."
US House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the US Congress has just bankrupted the 700 billion bailout package. of dollars for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell lower.
With 206 entries versus 227, the American representative house rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and prominent politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program, which was supposed to stem the chaos in financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters tried desperately to persuade critics from the hefty $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived.
While the vote was underway, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state bailout package could fail.
He recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of bankruptcy, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or cockroach flees when they feel danger. Does it mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could we verify if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same sensations as us?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years now articles by well-known scientists have been published.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you believe to be true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter impassable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the assumption that humans differ even from other primates is thus admitted.
Another dramatic peculiarity should occur in man's way of speaking: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
For this reason, it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose great problems for us.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from that there is another aspect of consciousness that would be easier for science to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates , in particular to the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we pass first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
So what is outlined for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Seen in this way, the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from more primitive body regions' activities of cortex and paleocephalus sensations, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on paleocephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep makes arguments that what appears to rats and humans as fear is probably felt so with the senses in both cases: but how could this occur, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
Does a cockroach in case of danger flee as if it also felt fear?
In my eyes the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And that is, neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalians, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalon responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for human beings: how is it that you would want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there are advances here at the neural level, as long as the same procedure is given up on rats and humans.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't do research on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly hit a wall.
I am precisely a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championship with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
Both host countries are limping in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used for the European Championships will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent director Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many members of the first division only last season were condemned for manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Promoters record increasing booking figures
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season by as much as more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views, the Germans' desire to travel according to a survey remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover gain of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, the German tourism association DRV said in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the travel agency surplus for October compared to 2007 would have amounted to about 11 percent, the DRV said.
As a prerequisite for these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008 would also be included.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States would be particularly in demand, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany would also be particularly popular travel destinations among Germans.
All-inclusive travel in particular is highly priced, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for reservations made well in advance or all-inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
The summer months would also have seen very good booking figures, so much so that a surplus of turnover would have been recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
Dennis Quaid replies indignantly
He wanted to promote a new film, in interview he talked about the private and now he has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her ex Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams with anger and retorts.
War of the Roses with delayed burst for the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now dispute with each other a bad quarrel - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed herself on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would learn only after the separation.
The occasion for the "striptease of the soul" was Ryan's work with the press for her new film "The Women" – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was one of clear blurting: it would be "unheard of", the fifty-four-year-old told the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reworks the story of our relationship".
It would also be "regrettable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "are publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval, which a separation means to every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since separation, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that has everything going well."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights are even up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have been rising for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed, still averaging around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees as the reason for this the weak quotation of the dollar, which would have led to a "waning desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected more strongly by hotel price recessions than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Flight prices are also on the upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class airline ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, but in First and Business Class price changes were far weaker.
In Germany, prices fell even sharper than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the collapse in prices would be on the one hand the falling economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, because of the agreement on open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, there would be increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came into play late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was formulated with precision, it passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the booths of the Hamburg arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the break was over and most were sitting back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for the HSV for almost 3 decades, he enjoys an even higher esteem than certain old players.
And so his warning has also found a hearing in the upper echelons.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Not everything here was good to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted to be more relaxed".
For the 1-nil those of Hamburg have to thank the header scored by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Martin Jol.
The SV Hamburg will turn 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as first in the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We can put everything in place," Marcell Jansen said.
He has the premonition, that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals signed late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the goal Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol forcefully relaunches.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, beer from one-liter mugs and designer Dirndln VIPs.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have little in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, already the photographers throw themselves at us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
This is how you make friends
The cheap Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist from the Wiesn and actually living north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress is still within its limits to this day.
And instead once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; No one looks at in disgust or embarrassment – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl catches strange glances at the chocolate banana stand.
A nunist pointed out to me that I would have tied the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
Stealthily I arrange the bow from back to left.
It's okay," he says and laughs.
Others do less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and iron the bare back against an uninvited one.
The guy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo" trail.
This he tells me, after he got rid of his one-liter mug of beer drunk before.
Right next to one of these fire hydrants, of which everyone thinks it is a dustbin.
Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 pm the sanitary workers walk in a herd on the square of the party, who must take care of the poor beoni
Nurses appear in packs every time – always 4 at a time they drag a tent-covered stretcher into a tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the tarpaulin in this coffin from blood alcohol content, is not seen.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitary workers shouts at me and disappears into the chaos.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear is circulating on Wall Street.
Early reports of the failure of the bailout package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily tumble by 700 points.
This was the largest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later the Down recovered a bit again.
At around 20:30 the most important world stock market barometer quoted/recorded with a good 5% in shortfall out of 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was stuck with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost just 14%, and the Bank of America lost about 12%.
No title could do it.
Goldman Sachs bank shares fell just 10%.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the rescue plan, financial funds were to be allocated for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents.
However, the sum must be paid not in one fell swoop, but in stages.
In return, the State had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate trend in prices, to reduce the charge for the state coffers.
The share price in Europe and the US in the downside vortex
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the US do not erase investors' doubts.
The share price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate falls to the bottom and tears the German stock market index down
The American Dow Jones index loses despite the planned salvation of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular losses in the price of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pulled the German stock market index into deep deficit.
The shares of the Monaco real estate lender lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank fell more than 20%.
The index of the German stock exchange DAX slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% to 5,839 points.
The world's stock markets are falling to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the U.S. government's $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to push financial markets back into business.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3% to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of business.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout, the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the benchmark Nikkei index after initial profits had a shortfall of 1.26% out of 11,743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1% to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex core index lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
In MDax they sell Arcandor shares after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to new shares for an amount of 23 million.
The business and tourism group has also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been creating perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fast freezing fuel lines, death by freezing now hangs over her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon has been creating havoc – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum / thrust / oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical gimmick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has amazed scholars for years: rockets do not behave at all as one would expect according to the law of gravitation.
On the contrary, it comes to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton firmly believes that before Einstein was not wrong, and attempts to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
From her evidently comes a force of attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is visible.
She herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the release 6 kidnappers appear to have been killed.
In southern Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reporting on Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safety, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of an expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages is still unclear: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It would have been "still just a matter of taking the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded from Germany a ransom in the amount of 6 million euros; The money was supposed to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostages after the ransom had been paid.
The men were to remain detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the crash on Shenfield Road in the city on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died soon after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving.
He was released on bail.
Stepfather's abuse "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise harassed and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the eighties, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent much time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse they had caused her.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends of Miss Randle, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, had "emotionally died", and that she had "given up on her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I tied her up and blindfolded her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harsher is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up before the court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie's father and mother describe having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was on his way from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They must have thought this was being dealt with internally at the MOD and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the bill of B&B
British construction companies could face a bill of more than £80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bank bailout.
The Government has given £14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) chief executive Adrian Coles said it was "irritating" that companies and their members had to pay.
The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... They are now called upon to foot part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies between them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC he believed it was unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering housing market are now being called upon to foot part of the bill of those institutions that have been far less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant bill," Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Turkey is broadening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building straddles between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial town halls.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the magnitude of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a laggard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 an ammunition train burst destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly decayed, largely overtaken by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet to Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-widening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car to the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt ride along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel facility - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and power pastry shops, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it must look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case with one or the other.
They have to be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey will be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited from memory: the ties of the not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, The whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now, in large part, be in Turkey's hands.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating country.
Milk rises to 5 pennies per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pence per liter from Monday.
It's the second price hike this year, after a two-pence rise in February, and comes after research by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Bail denied to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh has refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges hanging against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed temporary government give her total freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for on-the-word medical treatment, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court refused Sheikh Hasina's bail request on the grounds that she cannot get bail as she is already abroad on parole for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government seized power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the allegations against themselves.
Fear for Afghan anti-polio campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival television station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV sowed doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US prosecutor
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to review the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations involving potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or established," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated poorer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and pursue court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm of layoffs, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials quit.
(The inspector general's report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying he had primary responsibility for the dismissals, abdicated his leadership role, and was extraordinarily seconded during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honoured" to earn the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend things like tempo and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required strong vocals that were provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a UK single in 1979 and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's Bat album Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf — real name Marvin Lee Aday — has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other side streets, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street – without making Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
They want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that are expected to open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city's preservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the district municipal commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it would reopen the small street and install seating, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the Ramones album cover photo "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity — a snippet of city hardly changed at all that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Somewhat Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Discourse on the City's History that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even by day and bordered rusty-iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with weeks-old newspapers fluttering along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the street looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran nimbly across the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lies next to a cluster of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested it would need to be graced a bit.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California Studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School."
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a case in point.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving goals, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching languages other than English in the classroom, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The school's students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth-graders, an astounding 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
An equally astounding 93 percent of fourth-graders took the proficient-level test on English-language.
This incredible result was achieved by using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama's preferred one.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills, and a "no excuses" attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach for English learners is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had fantastic success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to identify what it was."
"It works," he noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model and replicate it in other schools with a Hispanic majority and English students?
The school's achievements make answering that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime advocate for bilingual education) and its own ongoing support for bilingual education prevent predicting Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic corny when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama truly wishes to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despising or trivializing them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday on concerns that even the US bailout for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Merchant Exchange in morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 per barrel in June, prices tumbled to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the weekend's frantic negotiations had led to a bailout deal "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our most pressing concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption home due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform for the past eight or more seasons, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a comeback.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals equalled the grayness of the menacing clouds that hung over them with a lackluster game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing attunement took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left in the first half.
"I didn't go off my path," Favre said of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were making catching plays, the defense heavily hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a loose throw and threw it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had regained the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard try for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When told both — the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter — Mangini said, "I can tell you I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a favorably flat race victory in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record in a career so stunning that it produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half cross-country skiers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his calves and missed a week of training.
Clearly, rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been somewhat criticised – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival – for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, counting on trailblazers as if it were a middle-distance race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept Gebrselassie in competition after the trailblazers faded.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made a final surge to part with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a large gap, resuming them after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Tucked away in the theme park sprawling over the suburbs of Orlando, just a few miles from the splendor, noise, and enormousness, lies the tranquil city where pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first incorporated all-black town in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools, and no prisons."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city he described — and that makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project — remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the thirties, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what's being lost."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called in for a keynote address on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grabbing and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of the oaks of the rural culture of southern blacks - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for the Eatonville image really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books such as Mules and Men (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a backdrop of black history and human drama.
Short as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Off the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trimmings, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the walk-through rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it the way she was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls Hurston captures by quoting men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned to her family who moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston swooped into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today prides itself on decent clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others grinned.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in a gravestone without a plaque at Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 80s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the fifties, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white guys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side," Mr. Franklin says.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say the desegregation of schools, while positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged — I remember this — you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural divide there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's plaqueless grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had beamed the limelight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the street.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what one would call high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's self-image.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new single-story bookstore (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a side road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 80s of the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for Eatonville's history, because of its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most interviews, some things — such as murals on Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a plump teacher with a penchant for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing her entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, no better, no worse and proud, creative, hard-working, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, who he said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"A lot of people, if they're just coming in here, they're going to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a pretty city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stalls and huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn't notice they were in the eye of the storm.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycombs above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the crash of 1929.
Bellhops shake metal tea carts across sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50 broken ironed shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still wait in line for their morning bagels at food carts on the sidewalks, and it's still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a working day.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's counter, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "trusted banker," were lining up for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places they commute from, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers like family members.
In past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was placed under receivership, and, as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to bail it out.
The clerks and clerks standing in front of me, fearful of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking Wall Street for more bailouts.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become proficient in finance in recent weeks.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failing bank, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed doorkeeper, almost fifty years old from my apartment building, changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Lives Remembered: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his scheme of music for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21s/under 21s, but at the time Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were in our twenties – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changeable being) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to deal with everything the music presented to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself."
He had said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner says:
If a conductor were to be knighted, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have watched more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his own words, simply "rode around the world one or two well-known warhorses."
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, it is not known.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like street signs representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained heavily in national general elections.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by a hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is related in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets, and some of their slogans were called xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final gathering in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis done immediately after the election, which established the far right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicating that the change was being brought about predominantly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Trip abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Prosecutors imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities who controlled him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travelling abroad was granted to Kent Police last Thursday after it provided prosecutors with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford District Court, Kent Police made a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's overseas travel to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted sex offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days' notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities can lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our perspective, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimise any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities would not pass him through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court, west London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him on the register of sex offenders.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing child abuse images.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor dresses from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and to capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
Because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of flamenco greats with the camera."
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, figure in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, getting to know them and being able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, be it a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare yourself with people, characters that sometimes you don't even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, like a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to Alameda de Hercules street, and will be open to the public until next October 16th.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to which time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "a disciplined way" to make up for the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, drafting and continuous remaking; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa pointed out, arguing that, on the contrary, it "has effects" and that it "makes people more nonconformist." For this reason, he invited writers to "not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The celebration of bullfights that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of bullfighting.
The weather has raged against this Festival preventing us from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
On the bill were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival took place regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being carried out in triumph, after having toreato with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than thanks to the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing by the Los Llanos arena without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the boos of much of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The agents order the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping flee.
The agents ordered the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping fled to escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Department of the Interior of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and falsifying public documents.
The accident occurred when officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, accelerated sharply and crossed the checkpoint.
The officers gave chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and took note of it once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
The hashish balls, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were later placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since the officials ascertained that the serial number had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that reported in the documentation of the van, the arrested person was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detainee A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the Californian road car told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4.30 pm Locklear "pressed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth. Reversing, he passed his sunglasses several times."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance, apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She looked confused," so officers took her to a specialist drug and alcohol treatment center for testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was discarded from the beginning, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear recovered from a specialty clinic in Arizona after being admitted following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges Andalusian UI federation to assume its responsibilities in Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following accusations of cronyism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against the one who has been an alderman in the Sevillian council until now.
However, the DU leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva allegedly committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
He likewise stressed that training is governed by "very strict codes of ethics for all public offices."
"Sangre de mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director attempted to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 medrilegno. The director had agreed on the condition that the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that mischose the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII", Garci noted.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes planned by the set design that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often rehearses before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, rehearse in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee — winning one — Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year — his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the latest selected Los girasoles ciegos — do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
Garci does not expect any awards from this film.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to just making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer pays tribute to another dancer also from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in interwar Europe, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible."
The dancer says: "we do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect its spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpiente" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been one of her students.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored for this."
The staging also includes musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, singing by Miguel Ortega, Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have been all-round divas, and who have always had many suitors."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, usually, she resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and even less considers her work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will start today, at 20.30 at the theater of Lope de Vega.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are extraordinary.
They caught my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" the three-year period also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Three years of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Three Years of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia,  it is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America is a little less popular without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and country has died in a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperately looking for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain good people to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the drug foundation created in honor of his eldest son who died of an overdose to the creation of the brand of homemade and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost much to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man died, an era is over.
Another Brit, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to call Paul Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: maintaining high regard for the need for righteousness and to have a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some people try, and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while certainly not lacking opportunities not to be.
"Why do I go out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud of as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect run," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were later taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine it, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and starting from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that we went first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, let it be to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
But no.
You had to go just to take the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they only had 'S' size t-shirts (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What kind of world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like that are trifles compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, on top of that, you had to deposit your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected to attract more than 11,000 people.
Then, as expected, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once we succeeded in the enterprise, the recovery turned out to be even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
At least 500 people will definitely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, won't even be ranked in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, didn't register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect ride, it will not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move around the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if he is there to visit someone and tells her that he will be available shortly.
All without blue screening.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that, if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extras".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox — or Chrome — and we spend more time surfing the net every day than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and here is a small example.
I took the photograph featured in this post at one of Microsoft's employee recreation venues in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soft drink machine a sign urges them to use their search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search the net.
Last week, moreover, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be released in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly look to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is increasingly becoming a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the strongman with a pointed mustache lifting weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's shirt, with cotton inside, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as English speakers call it, even if, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive emblem and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt wear as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive emblem and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Undergarments designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They are too beautiful.
Second assault for Honda oversales
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new MPV has an even larger interior space.
To all this must be added a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this MPV are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Nearly one million units of the Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second largest market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz within a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company's managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident of the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a compact five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the inclusion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - concern an improvement in terms of accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4-liter petrol engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keep engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model delivers 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horsepower in the first generation model, 100 horsepower are now available.
The 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango brand has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins you over quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What elements does your new collection for Mango start from in this fourth season of work for the Spanish company?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and observing how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do this frequently.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you are a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
Since I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rummage through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better than even going to the playground.
Then, once I was a dancer, I always paid close attention to dressing.
We know that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, did you go into crisis?
No.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I did the things I wanted from an early age and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me and also I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I am not too worried.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for some films shot last year to be released in different cinemas.
That's right, and I really want them to get out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be like this.
I want "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let's see if you like them
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say so.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So much is said about her, that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it is to help women in the third world, there is no turning back.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as an example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents the collision.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right or greater angles to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
'If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, or even diagonally; It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not taking advantage of infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the memorization of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision avoidance, a technology that Nissan hopes will come standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to get the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles in the path.
Drivers who repeat alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol levels, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle while intoxicated or if you do not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The aim of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drink-driving then return to driving the car.
The alcolock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is detected.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviors before they become criminal offenses.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some commercial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 pm, according to schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced you to use your hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the lineup, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time... Are you from here or ...
- No, no sir, you are Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well ...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the princes of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 navy soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City he threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a brief stop before moving into the room where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or problems.
The gloomy appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not once, but twice or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more of a teen page than a site for the general public.
What happens if I complete the game?
Well, a room appears inside the hotel.
It's still something, because you don't even talk about buying a better house...
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and probably there is no designer more exquisite and bont vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to encourage the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango window at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is located in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some accessories of ELAH to take your breath away and on the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters in height - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and as a knight he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – designed by her own hand – transformed for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for ballet essays and she, remembering other times,  He grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the building, but she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone first.
The following day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who travels by motorbike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having made sure beforehand, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there there, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the frenetic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of disengaging from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga poses, the classic massage or the "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" belies this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline isn't already flowing through your veins to regain balance in your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn your mind off and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, at most it gets scared, but it doesn't really really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It occurs with some frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadic (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, bedwetting (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but this is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with stages of very high fever, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, shouts, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet to the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situation).
What you can do, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the baby before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
Once the somniloquies appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if you appear very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to get information.
You will not achieve anything, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say it, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell the child that you might ask him questions during the night to learn his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... At last
Illhaeusern finally found their way back to victory at home after a long fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the most scoring chances turning one into winning the game.
The pace was not very fast during this match in which the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the away team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from distance, the Illhaeusern began to prevail and one after the other they provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain of tip and again Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a block in midfield, leaving only the wild Riahi on tip.
The start of the second half was decisive with two early chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais' first goal for the well-placed Illhaeusern he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be sent off a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of Illhaeusern, just retreated to "strengthen" the defense, except in the very last minutes of the game when, after a daring action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the soaring price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to secure working conditions and pay for sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, sailors have already shown their determination by burning tyres and shovels in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient since dawn, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the pier, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire-Atlantique, interrupted the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "have no intention of moving to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with diesel less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy" performer died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes said goodbye to film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest company in the sector, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is largely confident in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft with 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would divest more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, rebuilt by the American monetary authorities, would sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider selling a large part of its assets, as well as the sale of life insurance businesses to the international market and the United States, the newspaper points out based on more than authoritative sources.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on those disposals, France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: history of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives came out against Paulson's plan to rescue financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or an unprecedented drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, representatives rejected funding requested by Treasury Secretary Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it may already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was indeed moribund (...) then the baton would be quickly passed to the Federal Reserve and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further constrain credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for rival Citygroup to buy Wachovia's banking assets.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency action on behalf of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not just facing an American crisis, but a global crisis", added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market rose strongly.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bills fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year yield was 4.161% from 4.357% a day earlier.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, news received following a sharp fall in its shares on the stock exchange.
A week after drafting a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum equal to three billion dollars.
The price set is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at August 31.
MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% yield.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average price of $29 per share, which is lower than its current rate of 28%.
At around 5 p.m., Morgan Stanley stock was down 6.79% at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into a bank holding company," said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares while passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than it has previously taken.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum equal to 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our stake would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley shares at a price below their 7% book value.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are trading more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details regarding the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "sharply" lightened its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has soared.
Cost that refluxed on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had collected 15 billion dollars, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, ce lundi.
To found the republic on a socialism proper to the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Ecuador's Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the project of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" votes were 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% blank ballots.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate by a non-governmental organization had announced a landslide victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had moreover claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night between Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points designed to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving for it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-propose his candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama ahead in first televised duel
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House, here's a second one to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their respective victory in the televised duel, followed by a third of American households.
Political scientist David Gergen believes John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published Saturday grants Obama a five-point lead (49% to McCain's 44%), shows that the Democrat has prevailed.
An instant poll conducted by CBSNews of undecided voters found that 39% of them believe Obama is the winner, while 25% are betting on McCain.
An excellent performance by his fellow frontrunner Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"To underestimate it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing the "naivety" of the opponent regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he has often stated multiple times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What since yesterday has been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without elaborating, it proved to be concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," a Democratic ad replied this weekend, rebuking the Republican for failing to take the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20 000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for a campaign meeting.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the best person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a turning point," the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic insight to Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the shocks on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of an eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a fleet of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Cautiously, the two candidates dodged questions centered on the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial bailout adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the polling stations closed in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they did not even vote: "What's the point? They will do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression in front of foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and an asset freeze, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of votes," complained Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case it is the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a televised space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognise the validity of the ballot.
He points out that participation fees seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulations.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August, asks.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five opposition deputies in parliament, the most convenient ones in power."
The night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were returned to the Egyptian capital safely on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any press interview, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers", Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, just before dawn.
"There were shots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the official who requested anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed from Belgrade the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without elaborating.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army on patrol claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The silent majority of culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
So much the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the paltry sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historic sites?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the government French pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Château de Chinon, in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that heritage itself must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the protection of historical, genealogical, archival and patrimonial heritage, preserve private archives and archaeological sites with little money.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate developers and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will history and heritage be given the right place?
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday's tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the trust of the public, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 80s.
Faced with such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in drafting a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started operations, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve blood sample safety and field research over the following years, we have regained the trust of the public," she explains before proudly stating that by early 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has chaired it since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there are doubts and a serious illness could result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which manifests itself as a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusionary measures are adopted.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for some years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests, which allow the presence of the virus to be recognized directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment in which the person has contracted the disease to that in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them has thus decreased considerably.
These improvements have considerably reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is detected.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Héma-Québec directorate.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
As recently as a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"The needs increase as the population ages.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average make up only 3% of Quebecers acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are at least 18 years old and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of donors are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor group need to be renewed as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that you find hardly an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary, desolate.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is an abundance of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the inclusion in the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to withdraw more than a thousand each year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - L'Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A preliminary rounds, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first half on either side, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Recall that in the first game of the first leg, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler made it 3-1 in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed later in the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive goal
The Canadien and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory the only goal signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest points to the North
The prime minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
After the end of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected in today's by-elections.
"Expanding the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mill in images".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
Great means as in the middle of the electoral campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "blueprint" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first labor agreement with France, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on the timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in the realization of future projects.
At most, he limited himself to pointing out what he thought deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds."
That "territory twice the size of France" is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to solicit a national founding myth.
Quebec's foundations are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: gold fever in Habits, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a boundary line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
After all, "considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty."
What about the locals, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MEP of the PQ d'Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "common visions will be provided."
Moreover, the development of the North would adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves by transforming challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival as head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes renaming the Beauharnois power station to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage nationalizing hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest said it would be put into operation in 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it," he confessed to his militants, eliciting heartfelt applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a ballot in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very committed, especially in a Federal Council mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the liberal frontrunner with a platform of nationalist resolutions, especially "constitutional aspirations" that have gone smoothly: the PLQ demands above all recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft of the Northern Plan was received sceptically.
The leader of the FP, Pauline Marois, dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, did not respect its application.
If he had done so, "we would have progressed today," Marois commented alongside Jean-Talon candidate Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that all this will not simply be perceived as a spectacle," said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironically) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "disgrace" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot both about the Prime Minister's entourage and about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are with a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the facts imputed to him took place.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and leaves a child soldier rotting in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a travesty of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
For information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can be given a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper never ceases to flaunt and that sounds so nonsensical on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now a minority (to see what will happen after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches virtue, respect for law and order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Therein lies the shame, Mr. Toews, in the renunciation of all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million libel suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to hers.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a large sum of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed from the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these struggles with unequal weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that gags the opposition as well as frightening anyone who dares to pronounce himself again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates usually take place with the exchange of views and not with batons.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much trust in public opinion and badly rejects the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is evident?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the lawyers handsomely paid and not the whole of Canadians ; Here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Nero does so primarily because it rejects the mining's brutal means.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of gag (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum ordering them to stop using that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, Barrack Gold's lawsuit constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies en bloc the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics uncomfortable to the richest companies in the world, under penalty of multiple lawsuits, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific norms as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right of reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the academic world, as is the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic camps, yesterday finally came to an agreement on the biggest financial rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been weighing on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to limit the number of houses foreclosed for non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on the markets," said Bush administration Representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision was made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the crux of the matter: If we hadn't done this, priceless discomfort and turmoil would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential elections were rather supportive of the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves credit for adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to keep their domicile and the one concerning the salaries for managers of state-covered companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Asked on another channel to see if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"According to what I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (mortgages), then extended to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of liquidity and the lurch of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who threw up the first draft of a deal last week.
We seem to have come out of that impasse since the Democrats have accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to accommodate everyone, a provision has been added to Congress that if the government were to face losses over the next five years as a result of this program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment would have to be ratified by a further vote in Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get shares in protected companies that will be worth dividends in case of profit and that it can sell when the dust settles.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the plan's architects would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives, and a vote in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Evidently, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, which was in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros ($ 2.9 billion) due to the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and households appreciate now that times are uncertain."
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be on the verge of nationalizing another bank teetering in the balance of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently in progress at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time her trump card, for others her weak point.
Had he gotten rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
But what a constancy!
Paul Newman, who died Friday, at the age of 83, at his ranch in Connecticut, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the heyday.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Magical children are often born from mixed couples.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, ultimate mark of quality.
Since in him you recognized a whole country in love with the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, proud in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
That same civil rights activist was also the race car driver who finished second at the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as a sex symbol, although part of a model couple from 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The gray areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to show-business scandals, of which it will never be possible to completely reveal the mystery, go with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend the passing of Paul Newman was a blast to the heart for cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is revived through his interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Tennessee Williams' 1958 Burning Cat are confused in the memory.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up There Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and revived after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice thug in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter and vindictive billiard player in The Scoundrel, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar out of 9 nominations.
That face through the years, was his.
Still him.
Epochs follow one another through its path.
Young people know him above all for the cult movie Slap Shot: Colpo secco by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle had come full circle with a final role as godfather of the Irish mafia in Era mio padre, in 2003.
Unlike the greatest legends of cinema who soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its pomp, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, an amateur filmmaker French, defined it, with a touch of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performances exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic, carrion or desperate, of whom he expressed disarray and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian director Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated the film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained down yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the late actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift dies.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
The income from those sales, however, went to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And it was equally privileged for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & associates?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from calls for tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the execution of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, disclosed by the investigating authorities, they withdrew the money obtained from calls for tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the trip to the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession, he had to choose guesthouses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the drinks, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the calls for tenders, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri who, according to our information, mainly drew up the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of the "study trip" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the restaurant together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later named Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal errors and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however the invoice included 130 guests.
But the imaginative invoice compilers went too far when they pointed out Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, whose accounts - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even include documents in the name of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, director of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately understood that they were false documents.
"On the stamp, the name and VAT number of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice one hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the bill was catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for some time.
The assiduous compilers of invoices did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's invoice policy.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company VAT must be applied at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as we learn from the procedure of the Public Prosecutor's Office, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, due to formal defects - due to non-conforming invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Ground, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters also paid no attention to the fact that HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület dined there, which is why the liquidator of the company, according to our information, denied having issued that invoice.
Have issued invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért for almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Together with Zuschlag and partners, Biogate Kft, currently in liquidation, also collaborated with Zuschlag and its partners, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million forints to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even movement of money because the prepared invoices were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who can be connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to address the general manager of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov forwarded documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the consideration was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies were useful to him because, at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, who drafted the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the competition notice of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a call for the Socialist Party's public benefit organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 forints each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order to prevent this from coming to light, they submitted to TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the trend of invoice production.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It remains to be seen whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also have been offended for now, since his requests for the alleviation of his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have not been met so far.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive licitation: why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are inclined to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economist researchers at New York University have managed to discover the neuro-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to be left behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental rods.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method examined the active areas of the brains of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex comes into intensive operation when losing to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price is explained by avoiding the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists in the research team carried out a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups litigated against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told what was the real value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group in addition to this they promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money in case of loss at auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the winning was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Proving the neurologists hypothesis, members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control or "winning" group.
"These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, until now these explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor at New York University's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to contact the doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The term hepatitis is the collective name for contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the alimentary canal (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against the A and B virus, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, yellowish spots form on the skin and whites of the eyes, the feces become light and urine dark, healing occurs within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is estimated that only one in ten people receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analyzes.
This disease is much more frequent than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed people.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease it is worth turning to the family doctor when noticing any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 around the world by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first to end up in difficulty in Europe due to the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial - insurance institution with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been struggling for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may set a precedent.
Under the decision taken Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' shares had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis in the institute had then appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to fail.
The bank's shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, their lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices, the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The top management blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the American plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, the stock slowly started to rise again.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government has previously assured that investors need not fear losing money.
Among the bank's customers panic did not spread, branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing firms.
Does those who believe in God feel less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre survey, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all of them were looking at a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first of a series of researches in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test went exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes electroshock was connected to the left hand of the experiment subject.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would originate a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to have a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they gave an account of 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but the right image must be found.
"We have to look for an image towards which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father" - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it succeeds in changing our personality," Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be as much in people's pockets as in the sky above their heads; He knows where they spent their holidays, what clinic they attend and what interests him.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is still not enough.
What concerns skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data from its users as possible, and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders, which was: "let's put all the information in the world into a system!"
According to the director of Google interviewed, the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but software does not know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they do not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the searched words are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users can e.g. store their browsing history, they can look at what they have searched for and clicked, these will then generate much better tailor-made results in the long run; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our preferences declared and recorded previously.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - ask users worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of Internet users are provoked by the fright felt by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion against power.
However, one fact is confirmed, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights instead sighed with relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even afterwards you can not force Google with any point in the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully snatched nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain individual users' search lists and the entire two-month list of web pages and keywords.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data lash out at Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users who have appeared in numerous countries see in them the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft dismissed as conquering the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the keywords most often repeated in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all these can enter them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common circle of friends, easily learns with whom her wicked boy spent the night or a company can fire one of its employees because he wrote a sincere opinion on the top management:  One thing is certain, the concept of private life has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting for example with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time leaving no traces voluntarily).
There are not a few people who do not register on purpose to community pages so as not to be found, Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far existing.
The public is secretly waiting for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars of value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the AdWords / AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause great discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers alongside all this find alarming points: the top management, for example, has completely refused the protest of employees after doubling the company kindergarten fee, has considered the repeated daily catering of employees too expensive, but all this diminishes the fact that in 2006 Google bowed its head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon find itself before the American Supreme Court,  others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database may offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murderer to make the traces disappear
Police questioned two minors about Ózd's double murder, who were rightly suspected of helping to make the traces of the crime disappear," a spokesman for the police headquarters in the Borsod region said on Tuesday.
The young people have recognized the crime against them, they are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to information from MTI, defend themselves on the loose.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated multiple murder committed for profit.
The investigation showed that the twenty-three-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock exchange of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the offer of the Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four Ltd. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster occurred thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who was unable to unite his party behind a hastily botched law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the whole world will suffer from this afterwards.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to overlook the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifeline to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayers' money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect, then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for EU member states to overcome their national egoism and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions obtained more than 100 billion euros, according to which the anxieties that European taxpayers, like American taxpayers, will have to put their hands in their wallets to remedy the crisis, seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not cared much about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'saviors' must not wave the EUR 100 billion immediately, but it would be better if they decided in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
Intelligent machine imitates the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop collision avoidance technologies than to mimic obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example, those of bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, hornets gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic cue on how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic minicar equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of avoiding all collisions.
By flying, the bees form their own oval personal space that looks a lot like our protective shield," Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development, told the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a 300-degree view in every direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetry laser idea to copy the bee's sight function.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor which immediately turns it into a collision avoidance command.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damageable and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to the bees to dodge other bees, the robot, as a possibility, can rotate on itself, speed up and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high-energy density lithium-polymer batteries, which means they last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the instantaneousness of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvering data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of an immediate collision avoidance technology which, Nissan expects, can be installed in production vehicles within 10 years.
Another possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leads to the destination.

The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout bill for the purchase of disproportionate debts has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast Time, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout after a debate that had lasted for days, Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said that all that remained was to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: the programme will work and be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not a bailout of Wall Street but a reversal of the economic bandwagon.
The written version of the plan was made public before Asian markets opened at 8 a.m. Washington time (2 a.m. on Monday Central European time), but it did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the 2008 economic stabilization law concerning the program, after which it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which stipulated that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of bonds with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after Monday's vote of Congress, with these the Treasury Department will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind it, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will control the program in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits at the same time.
The purchase can be done through auctions and directly - announced competent ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law provides the means necessary for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to be ready to introduce the newly signed law," he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their good exit, defined by overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury offers the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank manager.
When buying disproportionate debts directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that directors' money is not exaggerated.
To this must be added that the already existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general managers, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, decreasing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain if the economy, and with it the bailed out bank, gets back on its feet.
The bill includes that over the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that sets out how to return to taxpayers the projected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industry prices continue to rise
Domestic industrial sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007, according to the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
Industrial export sales prices in July 2008 were 1.1% higher than in July 2008, while they fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in a year ago.
Domestic industrial sales prices for the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the processing sector also rose minimally, by 0.1%, compared to July.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with a 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemicals caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the products and chemicals sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a lesser extent in woodworking (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices rose by between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the authorities' increase in gas prices since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industry sectors, the largest increases occurred in the petroleum products processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metalworking products, prices rose by 13.2% and 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which accounted for a decisive role.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total, prices in the processing industry rose by 10.2% in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7% higher than last year.
In domestic sales among target groups in the sectors, the largest increase in monthly prices occurred in August in sectors producing capital goods (0.7%).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3%, in the energy and after-use sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the increase in the largest prices was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer articles the increase was 6.8%, for capital goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Industrial export sales prices in guilders rose in August by 1.1% compared with the previous month, compared with 12 months and decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian forint weakened against the euro by 1.7% against the dollar by 7.1% compared to August 2007, strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could come into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with local Hungarian representatives.
In his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic entry and control system is built overseas".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bailout plan on Sunday, but there are politicians calling for the Treasury secretary's resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration announced Sunday night that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bank bailout.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of untying the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves better suited than their rivals to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the foreground of economic issues, Obama has again recovered some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as vice president, has been lost.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion plan.
He pointed out that the proposal contains those passages of consumer protection that were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not let slip from calling McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "we're all going to have trouble swallowing this situation (...) But doing nothing is not a viable path."
The Republican senator said the proposal includes the creation of a finance minister's oversight committee and limiting the good exits of top managers, things he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a substantive role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution Devours His Parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian Social Democrats have been modernising Bavaria for decades, and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian Democrats, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible ended: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had plummeted to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 50s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the consequent modernization carried out in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they got the time wrong. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the political consequences are obvious.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, obstinate.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the freelancers, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Here support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily "Who with whom?" In the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition matters" he deals with the confused internal political situation in Austria as a result of the elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now everything revolves around the coalition; In the discussion broadcast on public television, the leaders of the parties barely showed the cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any event rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
BZÖ leader Jörg Haider repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing," Haider said.
Járóka: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris began the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, in her message to the plenum as the main speaker of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and moreover the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, Minister French for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities opened the conference at the highest level.
Among the guests at the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of Europe's leading civil and equal opportunities organisations.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz EP, recalled, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that Roma are excluded from the labor market primarily because of their low education.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle level of education and as a result of poor primary education only a small number of them can reach a higher education qualification."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in asserting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to make these links wider awareness among Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; Through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the deputy, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance the proper respect of existing and designed anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe," Járóka said.
In the name of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year since the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
The fox in the hen house
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to take out an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data of drugs depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies make the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims subject to the state of health of the possible customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not take out insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper process 10 years ago: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines you have purchased in the last year and a half, and from this the program shows which diseases you suffer from and what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large quantities of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to paper work does not have much left, even if small difficulties arise.
Among the cons is that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance-commercial point of view, counts as a factor of increased risk, the first two do not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for patient approval.
Now the authorities oblige them to do so even though they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies lately also process the result of laboratory tests and link them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and in parallel the control of usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
Before Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control powers to companies specializing in data services.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links data forwarding with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse approval because otherwise the insurers do not conclude the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the awkward Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the ugly electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen out, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is how long the pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will be decided by the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two much-criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not attached with all their strength to the chair.
They thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union obtained 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region, which is of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, are always important, but in future they will be forced to form a coalition.
As a first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Voters exponents of right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
By a strange twist of fate in the list of Free Voters enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treated without regard the woman with great ambitions.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces on somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber, who until now was plotting in the shadows, will also get an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the CSU that they deserved more support from his sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is rebuilt with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide her disappointment at the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
Certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not a single representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of the well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the fraud committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million people has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections held in controversial circumstances,  "conceded" a few seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a boycott previously evaluated.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines held by Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
He referred to a détente that the OSCE, assessing the election campaign, placed the emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one third of opposition candidates from standing in the elections.
Monday's quick report by the OSCE also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could hardly appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two countries independent for a month already.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate of the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remains despite the fact that "the authorities were afraid to let even one opponent enter a weightless parliament".
The opposition does not envisage protesting the results but rather tries to get the message to voters of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that not even the officially most aided class, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime adequate, which considers the creation of social security to be its main achievement.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the disintegration of social security "is reminiscent of sepulchral silence," Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseillaise menu
European Union and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are mainly mutually trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, among all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit dealing primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So this issue was not insisted on at the ninth summit organized yesterday in Marseilles.
President French Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in 5 years, i.e. increase trade to EUR 100 billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's largest trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, even though both sides played a role in the failure of this one.
The EU has confirmed that it remains in its energy and climate agenda, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be concluded at the climate conference scheduled for next year and the production of greenhouse gases by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel today to the capital French where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French firms will receive a contract worth EUR 20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from our news agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
Over three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
The Undersecretary at the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children, is progressively decreasing.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure starts against the crafty, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-slacker novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services" specifies the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening.
This is reformism," Brunetta stresses.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from employees, assures the general secretary: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was everyone's collaboration".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; No more coffee and croissant.
Word of Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione
of Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people at work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
"whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration today flaunts numbers about the lower absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the population of 'industrious idlers' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree".
In particular, the TAR will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for infirmity dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of mutilated and invalids of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "deep appreciation for the constant associative commitment in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Naturally, an indignant 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Of particular significance are the numerous initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is right to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to give up in the alarm on its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini underlined "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment aimed at putting an urgent end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive", remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this 'downward trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is loosened that tragedy erupts.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to combat the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - underlined Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this starting from the world of school".
"A further effort is needed - he added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection provided for victims of work" and the "welfare drift towards which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneity or donations from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 players under accusation, put your hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a prolonged period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is according to the European Commission, which in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
"From this scientific opinion - reads the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high hearing levels may unconsciously damage their hearing beyond repair," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - continues the EU manager - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific advice, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"The scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music equipment and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to these noise sources.
This damage can be greatly limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limits on the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno launches the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we start, in March it closes, in June we will draw conclusions.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capital", which took office this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the Council and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so as to be able to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - Alemanno emphasizes - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome of which political decision-makers, who remain the Council and the City Council, can then avail themselves.
There is no overlapping of roles but only the desire to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of daily life and on the emergencies that are maintained from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further ahead, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
In addition, the mayor of Rome is keen to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a bandwagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap in level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a unified spirit about its future".
A future that, specifies the mayor of Rome "will not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. Here's why
A well-known American politician who wants to pass for an independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big chutzpah: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!"
In reality they are attacks that do not say much; These attacks are clearly racial in nature and do not answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
It comes out a side of the American mentality kept covered to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll take care of where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will get out of America.
Things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to perform.
USA, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, the "killer" of the printed press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Also, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the general public is not to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national daily affairs is going down the wrong path.
In the local field the executive team is at 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening a way to the internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms – that is, the editors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their reporters share their values, while locally the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "job security."
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
"Safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
The editors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to arrive at 15 days in total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-pact relating to the Unipol-BNL takeover.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate developer be allowed to travel the route from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the prosecutor gave a contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times informing us that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington' and the world of finance,  strong especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, that has become overwhelmingly alive with the vote I mentioned at the beginning.
However, this is just an example of the changes, of the great changes, that the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or already allows us to see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of phenomena in incubation for some time that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close ties with foreign countries, but which first of all involve to a very large extent the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single State.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, by the way, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or does not have much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which, divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies, fails to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when it comes to the corners it is only the States that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back on track.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal to an increasing extent with those very little immaterial things that are water,  Crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are still absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So those who find themselves sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty which, however, presages a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request for someone who knows how to take matters into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, especially economic ones, which proved to be so inadequate and full of gray areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is, it seems to be gaining ground, in large sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have done their time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, underground feeds a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of recent and very recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory).  of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
One gets the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats someone would say, are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating,  It increases, it potentially shakes out of proportion.
In the face of all this, to speak of a 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda would frankly be exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open certainly isn't open at all.
The superglue to walk on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of noodles," says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "easily detaches from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
WALKING ON WALLS? "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For the moment no superheroes.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed by microfibers like hair that cleans itself of dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Pay attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing depending on the effectiveness with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs,  canceling the beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already come under fire because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to levels considered toxic.
DRUGS AT RISK - The same Italian Medicines Agency had given news in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink if you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package inserts of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not be impressed but ask for clarification from the doctor or pharmacist » underlined the expert to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade patterns and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the main critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked quite a few controversies and that for years was reproached to the economist, but which has now proved to be correct.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a popularizer with a "very aggressive" style, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package»
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the better known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the revised interface made less spartan, other more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format,  the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the Office suite 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by e-mail, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English one that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a driving force for the diffusion in homes, it is precisely in the business environment that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And there are also companies that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for word processing equivalent to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also tests positive and fourth doping case
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best climber jersey.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third-generation EPO, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity to Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the third-generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey of best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Is this turning Italy into a nation of racists? This is what is asked in a long article in the New York Times that dedicated a long article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the NYT calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And that's not all.
Even the new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A tendency underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the billionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 3000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that still remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is precisely what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (NTSB) said that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a team of investigators was sent, who then identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he went around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An SUV outside the box with an original design and well defined by strong lines, large surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in short, GLK the latest born among the "compact" offroad of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of fresh air in this sector.
Precisely because of its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the GLK SUV, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
So the advertising hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D billboard campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-billboards, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street in Milan, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? See.
Here's who are the Italian hooligans
Of the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian national team for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with opposing fans.
The group extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added small groups (few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all names, therefore easily checkable.
And the Interior Ministry had in fact checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had been refused tickets and prevented from travelling.
Now the Interior Ministry waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never set foot in a stadium again.
Fortunately.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others will be added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way", argue the Interior Ministry.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, of the secret services, which deals precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the outstretched arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminale Observatory a few weeks ago (he took the place that first belonged to Francesco Tagliente and then to Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles at Mameli's hymn: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me they are not education ...".
Students victims of high rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now assumed very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that the families of origin should bear - explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market as to trigger a process of generalized increase also for residents".
In most cases, rental offers contain a series of violations: free contracts, unregistered, without rent limit, linked sub-leases.
For the Sunia extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of taxation, can control prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it ranges from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they carry a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the rent asked to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic cinemas
Historic cinemas close in favor of Multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the suburbs of large multiplexes and the consequent death by consumption of single-screen cinemas in the central areas of cities, is one of those events that seem inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places full of memory, "it is as if a friend was missing, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize of Cannes,  and that told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and to pay the greatest price are above all the cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna stands out with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the highest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but we should guarantee the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of allocation for the fund in favor of merchants: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is ethically and morally shameful that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed to support the sector."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, has decided to run for cover with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules envisaged there are tax relief measures in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic zone and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
«It is an initiative that I like» observes Giuseppe Tornatore «and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counteract the overwhelming power of multiplexes, traditional cinemas must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the billboards blackened by dust I turn the other way».
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli gang".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association, are heavy.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his lawyer nephew, the boss's namesake, already convicted of mafia-style criminal association, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense", write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the gang - write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities, facilitating the possibilities, already enormous, of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusion between local authorities and organized crime there are many" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'Ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean".
This morning's arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli gang.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged influences between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of its dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, after the run-off in May 2006.
He cried scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having concocted everything for a political matter, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli gang had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the prosecutors, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration to the interests of the gang".
When energy is born from the waves, now the big names take the field
It is an endless field, which occupies over 70% of the surface of the planet and now the great world energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have set their eyes, and now try to get their hands, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental demands and the new increase in oil are boosting the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by plants to exploit the wave motion of the seas.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition there would be currents and tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more are betting on marine energy and among these companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesman of a subsidiary company of the US oil giant to the Wall Street Journal business newspaper - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is no small sign, especially considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate according to observers a rising interest.
Technology to be fine-tuned.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not dispel all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four such plants being planned, awaiting only federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the turbine blades to turn, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others bordering the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
