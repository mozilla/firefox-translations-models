The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored losses.
CEZ share transactions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed since the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the stock crash on Wall Street.
Thus, even here, there is a reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the local financial sector.
Collapse of Actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the shares of the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, later canceled a part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day canceled almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than 5%, but in the end losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“Rescue action planning is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” noted Hong Kong’s head of the Valutes office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, runs financial policy alone, so without depending on the central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer from the consequences.
Massacre of American Actions
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system’s support plan, for which $700 billion (nearly twelve trillion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
Lawmakers have ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the U.S. actions experienced a massacre and the main indices of the shares recorded the largest collapse since more than twenty years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a collapse of similar size was last observed in 1987.
The index was lowered even before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has succumbed: the U.S. government can give $700 billion to the banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be early next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system totaling $700 million (nearly $120 billion).
But it's not said yet.
Congressional representatives, therefore, must define some details of the understanding before publishing the final form of the law and voting for it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday he told Reuters, the chairman of the Barney Frank House Banking and Financial Services Committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the approval of the financial plan will take place should be the first and fundamental psychological factor able to awaken financial markets.
Subsequently, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to achieve the help of the markets.
Paulson: the Plan must be effective
“We’ve taken a big step forward.”
“We have clarified our different views about the form of the market stabilization package presentation,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators’ delegates met the night between Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should serve to acquire non-marketable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
“It’s necessary to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re at it,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trade on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
Lawmakers are hoping it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the amount of the rest of the sum in the event that it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the finals 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Even if the President can veto this decision, Congress can overwhelm his right of veto.
Despite these changes, the program’s basic thinking has remained, to the fins to buy passive mortgage values, whose price has plummeted due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We have worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday and Senate bill on Monday,” the Republican senator mentioned.
The progress in the negotiations is also satisfied with the American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciates “the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said lawmakers had agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of the reductions, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve taken a big step towards the deal that will work and it will be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan counts on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on instalments for debtors and will allow it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main treasurer of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is because we don't know how and for what price problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial as to how the losses will be divided between them in the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“Much more important, it is that already this week the representatives of the congress will find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important time,” said Marek.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to Sunday’s early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (VP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZ), the sub-prefect of K?rnten J?rg Haider, is preparing the triumphant return in national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic one (SP) with 29.8% of the vote, compared to the last elections in 2006 but loses 5.5%.
Even worse went for VP, who loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic outcome of the popular, who provoked early elections.
Still at the beginning of July, when the VP left the coalition, the popular had in the preferences ahead of SP? a considerable advantage.
But the voters evidently punished them because they sank the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that they could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, that is, towards the renewal of the SP and VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the Liberals (FPs) gained 18% early and the BZ’s 11% of the vote – but the socio-democratics simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (then the FPO was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZZ) which was even a cause of sanctions by the EU.
On this evolution evidently plays Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
In the Parliament he also managed to enter the Green Party which, however, fell slightly, descending among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and did not enter Parliament.
Duel to the death: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost any mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you procure an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you'd hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to us the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view, for this there is not even a goal reason.
But if on your shelves you crowd hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls probably, such a turntable at least you dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply MP3 format.
Here too there are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 crowns, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the twenty kroner headphones of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is decided.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read the music, but what they don’t make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and text messages, can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even navigate.
And if we take smartphones and handhelds into account you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle for no refrigerator to do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your mobile phone and the first the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cellphones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for inexpensive phones do not count that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add to it, from time to time, some call, get another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasts at a minimum of 9 hours at continuous functionality with a reload.
An additional problem exists when downloading the music into the phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipods) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library sorted by the names of the performers, the name of the album, genre or according to the user's classification.
Some devices only play the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are interested in the resistance of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If the music serves you mainly from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need any mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is now, clearly possible to any cell phone.
You don’t have to deal with too much about which formats the cell phone or reader recognize.
The MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of the devices support music in WMA format.
There is less of the AAC (formatted used by the company Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile phone player.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
Prices are not really low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of sale of music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry their cell phones in the back.
To anyone who wants to hear a little shilling in his pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry the headphones behind or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of cellphone-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and technically equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for the common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, the easy handling.
The simple ones that are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) anyone really does it to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the maneuverability once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping into the launch of the mobile internet and consequently of a giant bill for data transmission.
What device to take
Even the cheapest phones (for example Vodafone 527) normally have an interchangeable memory card slot (of the M2 type, microSDG, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which fall within the 2 000 kroner.
But be careful
The basic models support only the cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones are also making with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy yourself an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don’t have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These luminaires have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service approaches the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has made way more in this way, which walkman line phones have the same scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the brands indicated above ensure the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
But there’s something missing – a virtual operator that obliges traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, he also confirmed it, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regularization of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost them less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high towards Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
On the other hand, the operators of the mobile telophons like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council, Pavel Dvo?k, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with their network no longer has many possibilities. (Although it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now.)
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a considerable decrease in prices, to which the traditional operators should then react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices as in us in Britain resounded in Britain.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that they can be really successful.
After all, for example, we don’t have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to buy more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic it belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to work, it takes many fewer customers than to a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them, i.e., relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually come at a low cost, they offer low-priced calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
So for example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-target not least.
This operator is aiming specifically for men.
“True men choose the Mobilking operator they like and can be trusted,” says David Seibertz, CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also say a similar concept like in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav epick doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the service point of view it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say the operators of the mobile network
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," Jana Studni?kov?, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
Rather, on the contrary, they try to do everything because no potential competitor is created.
For some time he has not hidden his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef?nika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner you do it better.
We have negotiated repeatedly on this possibility with all the Czech mobile network operators.
We have already managed to progress in negotiations with some of them," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
From the unofficial information it emerges that the first virtual operator will have to have it perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, around his creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
“Right now we don’t believe that in the Czech market there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now, no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us,” he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr?e of Telefònika O2’s press section.
The specificity of the Czech market is also the case with other operators.
T-Mobil press spokesman Martina Kemrov added in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both of us, on which it is possible to continue to build."
He adds: “In the T-Mobil network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this time we must have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather than at achieving its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav adds: “We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this, especially in the context of spending and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most producing.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
The competent authorities -with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby to the decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the creation U:fon testify that when the operators keep to one thing they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against "T" in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is a testament to public access information from the web pages of T.
But now U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov said: “The environment of competition in the mobile phone market has been little enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place on him and especially on his high-end services.
Of the attitude of mobile operators, however, the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of the “T” that unfortunately in Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OHS).
However, this has taken its typical position towards the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator had been implemented.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers probably wasn’t quite attractive for traditional operators,” said Kristi?n Chalupa, of the OHS External Relations section, in responding to our question.
Such a formulation statement by the representatives of the operators perhaps not surprising.
Instead, on the part of the office that must defend the interest of consumers and moreover take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of his position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristin Chalupa adds: “Abroad where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile services.”
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of OHS.
Truly shocked in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence arises.
Equally as the exact price of gasoline for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding responsibility for its market behaviour.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by T, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the operator of the network.
And the mobile operator has – at all logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we don’t admit this argument, for OHS it should be a minimum alleviating that three mobile operators are going so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Unloading responsibility to T in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which OHS keeps you out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of the rights of ICT on the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts have expected the improvement of the situation from this.
This fact the representatives of OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks
While without us noticing, the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
So for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only predetermined people.
The magic is that the company towards the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives offers of special prices (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar presale.
"If the cases you are talking about, of which we will be interested, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrov? replied to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of the subjects responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a profit not indifferent and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav epick warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the regular customers of mobile operators.”
But this should be a strange minimum at the "T".
In addition, another issue opens up for OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that OHS has strong enough rights to unmask similar activities and if you do not want you will not have to settle for the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not more expensive
As has already been said in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant lowering of prices for services.
At the same time, practically in all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - market too small, to the too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries in these cases, the regulatory bodies have intervened in defense not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then the creation of the first virtual operator was created and others joined.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies launch the case from one to the other as a hot potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator will really appear soon with us, the Czech mobile phone market will get back in motion.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
And maybe we'll stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol?nek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m?j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji?B?lohl?vek.
There are four versions available – solo with the male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The singing is under the direction of Katezhina Kn?nkov? and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem's revisions are Otakar Jeremi? and Jaroslav Kr?ek.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
B?lohl?vek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He has already said earlier on the radio "Eesk-Rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants to solo, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear diction, that the text is very understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m?j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in Josef Kajetn Tyl's original opera Fidlovashka accompanied by the music of Franti?ek ?kroupa.
He bought the popularity and the people spontaneously made it his own.
The first verse of the song after the foundation of the Czechoslavacchia in 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Wednesday MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 it will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will board the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in their pocket.
At this time they can provide it about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day and 90-day and annual one (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged in the Infopoints and in the offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum metro station, Mustek, N?dra? Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?any, Kobylisy, Rajsk? zahrada, Ka?erov and Luka.
The coupons can already be purchased yesterday on the internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers before the afternoon took advantage of the service.
Those who start using the service via the internet can completely forget the counters in the metro stops where so far they had to make long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon is bought via the internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a counter with trained staff that will help those interested in purchasing on the internet and will also record the credit acquired on their card," project spokesman Martin Opatrn said.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to load electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the metro entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket collectors and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly metro stops, Budjovick, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
“There are now five of them all over the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatre said.
The coupon will be checked by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and after payment of the coupon, it will be charged on.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In trains added in the integrated transport of Prague there are controllers with card readers with whom they verify the validity of temporal and zonal," explained the mode of control of Filip tickets from the Ropid organization, which fine-tunes the city's city transport hours.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s cashier’s.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition you have to place the Opencard at the point determined next to the checkout.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
“If the passenger needs to check the validity of the charged coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,” Dr?pal added.
Passengers who take the city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, they can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
This will display information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include ?umava to the United States.
This results from the letter filed in the Southern Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US president in 1945.
This is the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of the South Bohemia.
The Germans of Chesko Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "trua district" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovak.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units reach German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it writes in the letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of ?umava with all their heart."
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudetto Germans hope only to brutality, lack of concern, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to assume the proctate on ?umava now and always.
“We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, at all, at all, to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the perpetrators cannot sign it is the alleged fear of thirst for revenge by the "chian oppressors".
If the president of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Eumava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the mastery of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive to our knowledge of the after-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the then-then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to in no sense that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility altogether.
Some expected the United States and Britain negotiated a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Eeské Budjovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budjovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Hol?t?n, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to visit him for him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that once he got home the Czech would be convenient for him," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia pima of the war, according to him counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Benec would be moved by the Republic.
Don't think - you'll pay!
The Emotional Campaign Will Attach Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so you could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale? ?eb?ek, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And remind him to put on his belt before he leaves.
It wants to touch in the conscience especially the young drivers, motorcycologists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will you appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
This is also witnessed by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalized on the plaque.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you will pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with their life.
The commercials will "scaft" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic scenes of accident victims can be commonly seen.
It is thus promising to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to the drivers
"With the drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or accident.
We must remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Koon of the Na Homolce hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicity, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that alert the hazard drivers are already less effective.
"If you have installed the fixed panel that warns of the danger, it will probably soon get confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Koon.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Provisional Government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has expressed his words for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all of them,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will hold a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the eventual restitution will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the bulldozers to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a hint at the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City. . .
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, that is, according to him, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose the conclusion of the peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get Golan’s heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to give up permanent support, which offer Hamas terrorism, (Shia movement) of Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,” he said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, it would be the case according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then it would be a certain cooling that would occur," he noted after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Ovacha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kusera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence at a time.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself the same during negotiations.
"It recommends the appeal to the Court of the Majorage then it will be possible to obtain a pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter into the matter is to lend the condemned the "perpetent legal support", the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time he said that such support is already lending him to the Indian side.
“We have the most interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
Indians admit it too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We truly consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech scientists a profound mistake,” he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got the promise to deal with it.
“I’ve gotten a lot of promise,” he just noted.
Questions After the Accident: Are Stewards on Buses Illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long-distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency bus, the question came out if stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
“If we want to comply with the laws severely and formally, the steward’s activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic,” says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost his life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the spot less safe than the bus, despite still having two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus has standing places according to the registration booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers must sit.
The buses of Student Agency have no standing places, the director of the company Radim Janaura confirmed it to the website Aktu?ln?.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
He was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the ride if they have the assigned seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law is concerned with the regularization of this role.”
No regulation, however, prohibits the carrier from carrying out services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," spokesman Hanzelka adds less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn, on the other hand, believes that the law takes care of this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has homologated standing seats.
All here," he says.
It captures buses in urban areas where there are standing places and maximum limited speed, intercity with standing places with higher mashamate speed and long journeys without standing seats with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hoon does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
It’s not even safe there when a turbulence comes along and the flight attendant can bang his head.”
“If the bus does abrupt braking, the laws of physics are obviously valid.
Equally as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," she says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Janaura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers steward services.
This takes about two hundred.
The director even after the accident considers their job dangerous.
“As soon as I feel like I have to consider the profession of the steward as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they go up.
It would also reduce expenses,” he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of lines from Student Agency, justified the stewards’ absence of his means as an interest in safety.
“We don’t have hostess, we oppose from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," said less than a year ago, Taden.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess from the Plzec region died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid it with an abrupt maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Janaura refuses the fact that the two places reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"You can't reserve these seats on long-term coaches, they are incedible."
The company plans to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the precise movement of the stewarts on board the buses.
“They have not achieved any concrete results though.
They don’t consider them so much the buses, they take more care of the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving,” says the expert Hoon.
“The Ministry of Transport does not see the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to passenger safety,” concludes spokesman Havelka, which control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
He approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and the adjacent marine areas.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the OSN Division for issues on oceans and maritime rights.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Vaclav Mikulka, is following his exposition and occasionally adds something.
Dominate the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms so far that carry the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest seabed of the mainland
The coastal states began to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention, i.e. they read about the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
That has under the convention an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
In short, by continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country presents before the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical-professional aid.
The commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three nominees have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a global echo.
But New Zealand has also gained us – the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so roughly six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will yield them in the future from the seabed, as they re-propose will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually present their demands.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
There where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, which the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.”
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not Klondike,” director Mikulka says, said, “with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If he shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean stretched between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary schem, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
The hopes of Dusseldorf point to Frankfurt
There are also the words in the letter of the director of the WestLB addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of the savings banks" through the unit meeting of the bank of Dusseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch “a competent blockade” with lasting profits in such a firm.
Moreover, such a whole union could be a decisive push for further links in the sector of the banks of the Lander.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Service Agency, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the customers of the Savings Banks themselves because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB is certainly already talked about for quite a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas when presenting the first half of the year’s revenue that a merger of the house at Mainz Street with a national bank like Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board member of the Deka, which half of which is brought by the regional banks and consortia of the savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
Conversations, however, have, as they say in the square of business, just begun.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those that matter most in the business street in Frankfurt, is not talked about the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003, for a short time it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
Nothing about this three-way association was done.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank in Hesse was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions were also unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank went to the Baden-Wurttemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always often thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end, Gonther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Separately, this seems to be created cognition, that the different houses in the public sector need to be approached.
As the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Wurttemberg could first occur.
For Helaba, this is not entirely good news.
If the pressure increases for other castings, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be a junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of the Assia-Turingia savings banks that participates with 85 percent of Helaba, put the bolt at the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic arguments are just one account.
On the other hand there is also the question how the different business models of the individual houses match.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with what business model the future of the regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the German savings coffers association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of the administration expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the barrel of 5l. of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded massif and demonstrates to the about 200 travelers what are the deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first from Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking lot next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 23.45 with destination Monaco, Beer Festival", arrival scheduled at 6.30 am.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, says Marco, that it’s not for Italians.
Marco carrying a long coat with a false fur liner and a pair of glasses with silver wide splints belong to him the buses.
For 5 years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
The outward journey by night, day at the party, I return at 10.30 pm.
Staying would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for Brennero.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better this way, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian license plates buses on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left it is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Leaving asideviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the beer tent doors open, it means running!", quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Running!" Run and occupy the places at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 euros, Mark screams.
And don't forget to tip.
"Provence at the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as they leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 22.30 punctual we meet again here! Do you understand?"
We're leaving for the party.
On the way one attacks as he follows the yellow caps to the trees, the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to pull the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as the "end of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, we are talking about 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are strengthened with 7 South Tyrolean agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistic about nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care in front of the British (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians, it is the tent of the Hofbruuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck said last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also hinted that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis began on the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtains a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from the turmoil on the markets.
An experienced person of the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
After all, the losses of the Depfa affiliate are.
The state lender according to a newspaper article has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank’s reserves had decreased by 95% of the €2.37 million, the share of equity also sold from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current incomes and net incomes from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared last year, profits from increases of both applications and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in loans fell more than 70% on the 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for entrepreneurial consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had been lost in speculation with commercial real estate, which were spun off in Aareal Bank.
As income in the classic state funding was too low, Depfa has committed more to infrastructure projects and financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to cushion the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends were cancelled.
Already in 2007 they were reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is a major funder of the state and infrastructure.
He is more dependent on refinancing the market among banks compared to other institutions because he does not have client trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of credits among the banks largely dried up, because the banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires the refinancing means for a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – in the short term.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice, the financial needs of the group have been covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of international monetary markets mostly not working.
From other sources you can hear, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the steering committee of HRE Georg Funke said that the HRE group will not need the money markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Board (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still insured.
This is hoped for the bank’s stock and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the unimpodedness of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be used completely.
The opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the bank on Sunday night, according to what was learned, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The share course drops 75% of the 3.30 Euros.
They hold the mortgage courses quite well.
While the previous degree debts are almost immovable, they yield the courses of the posterized credits.
The loans of the subsidiary W?rttemberg-Hypo understandably have been hit, with the beginnings of more than 2009.
First the IDF's mortgages seemed like an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the importance of the Depfa has settled the crisis, will have to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the less damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, you can count on an amortization of annuities by the end.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But it concerns the information overturned due to partial statilizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create especially for long-term investors a few sleepless nights with the decision whether to divide themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains countervail tax.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany’s help for the release of the hostages – the experts arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 kidnapped European hostages, there is more and more detailed information.
On the rescue operation as much as the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior participates in the rescue operation, German special units participated.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the federal avian police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on site.
As the spokesman of the ministries announced on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get there luckily,” an interior ministry spokesman said.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers on September 19 in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or the possible ransom payments.
The liberated ones have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin, when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the tapes of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to gnawn: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
First Day of School in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had the fifa to go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
The road I had to find it alone and luckily I was not lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until at 8.40 a brief interview with the professor begins, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
Meanwhile, I am not the kind who speaks willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren
Since I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed so I settled in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy to have already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, chuggled and signaled and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me gnawed, for her it was an honor to sit next to a student of exchange
The rest of the hour of class had continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was attacked in the true sense of the word.
Everything spoke messy and giggled and annoyed me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the Japanese’s English.
In the pause everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the basket for Lunch – it’s different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, saucenicines, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu ..
To be honest, I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
The fact is, that everything is really good.
Perhaps except the plums put in salt, brrr!
Bento is not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It happens a few times that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of making the acquaintance of the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I said, that I would want to go to school for a year in Japan.
I have always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas fervor for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn the Japanese language a bit.
I was completely convinced that I was there once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and traditions.
They care a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of the latest technology and trends – on the other side: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have never seen in my life.”
U.S. Representation Chamber rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has just bankrupted the $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 entries around 227, the U.S. representative company rejected the government’s rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and prominent politicians of both parties had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been stemmed.
In a dramatic action, supporters desperately attempted to persuade critics from the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited the consensus, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived.
While suffrage was underway, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the investors’ concerns was that the state bailout package could fail.
He recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, he collapsed again.
Experts now expect more serious turmoil on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
1. Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach escapes when they feel the danger. Does that mean that they feel fear too?
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be if, when they behave in the same way, they have the same feeling as us?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years have been published articles by well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers chosen to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having managed to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter into an impractical territory, because the base of reference does not fit.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do as well. That is, he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to transmit our feeling to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is why it is directly involved in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should arise in the way of speaking of man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said that it is linked to consciousness.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but other than that there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
We could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, especially the example of visualization.
Therefore, by this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, passes first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What is outlined for the feelings?
I blame them on the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies working memory.
This is how the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
With respect to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the cephalo paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has nevertheless concentrated more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I think it is undemonstrable.
Pankseep suggests that what for rats and humans looks like fear, is probably so perceived with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach in case of danger flee as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital resemblance.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be of help: rats and humans have paleoencephalos similar, cockroaches not even a brain.
Is paleoencephalic responsible for feelings?
And even if it could prove it to be for human beings: how is it that you would like to prove it on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, as long as the same procedure is given up on rats and men.
How I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do it on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly bumping into a wall.
I am a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a show of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
Both host countries limp in the roadmap for construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually the number of stadiums to be used at the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work with the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigoij Surkis.
"UEFA will constantly keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent director Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It would be "sincere danger that the PZPN is unable to operate under the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer from it."
Numerous representatives of the first division only in the last season were condemned for manipulation, in the end it had to postpone the beginning of the League at the last moment.
Promoters record increasing figures in bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased in a clear way - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak views of the conjuncture, the desire to travel of the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover plus of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Tourism Association DRV said in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are booking quotas increased even already for the autumn months.
Therefore, the surplus of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, DRV said.
The figures of the GfK are prerequisites for these results, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Including would also be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar listing, travel to the United States would be in particular required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Particularly requested travel destinations would also be incumbed to the Germans, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as places inside Germany.
Especially all-inclusive travels have a high price, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the costs rising for energy and groceries, the costs in this case would be "best calculable for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made well in advance or offers with all-inclusive, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent figures of booking, so much so that compared to the year before it would again have recorded a surplus of turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
Dennis Quaid is indignant
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has a grind with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared adulter his former Dennis Quaid.
He foams with rage and retorts.
The Roses War was delayed for former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two actors in Hollywood now face each other a bad quarrel - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with InStyle magazine last week for the first time was about the reasons for the marriage failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me, and that was very painful.”
The extent of the betrayals she would only come to know after the separation.
The occasion for the "battle of the soul" was the work with the press of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: he would be “inaudiated,” the fifty-four-year-old told the New York Daily News, that “Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reworks the story of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again "publicly remembered the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is all for the best."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel nights have become more affordable again – this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year in 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter it observed a sharp decline in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined again on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already at 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 up to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak price of the dollar, which would have led to a "falling desire to travel for American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still marks up:
Due to the increase in kerosene passengers of the Economy Class had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel-intensive flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, Economy Class airline ticket prices fell by an average of 1.25% compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business, however, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have plummeted even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for the internal German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices would on the one hand, downward economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be an increase of competition over the open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure from competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high figure of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the makeshift landing for the national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came into the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was formulated precisely, he passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the cab hall of the Hamburg arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the break of play was over and most sat back in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades at HSV, enjoys an even greater estimate of certain old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the upper echelons.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumbs as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
"Today not everything was good to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero those in Hamburg must thank the header of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak players of Gladbach could not do harm the weak players in Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol summed up.
The SV in Hamburg will turn 121 on Monday.
The spectators celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the ranking flashing on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It's going to be a birthday with no real party.
“We are able to put everything right,” said Marcell Jansen.
It has the presentiment, that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the goal Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – that is, slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol strongly relaunches.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, one-liter mug beer and vip in designer Dirndln.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, already the photographers are throwing themselves at us and taking photos to fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-bit Dirndl seems to achieve its goal.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually resident north of the white sausages equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to date still remains within the limits.
And instead, once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Just the apron of my Dirndl picks up strange glances at the chocolate banana stand.
A monachen points out to me that I would fasten the apron wrong: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind widow."
Spronely I settle the bow from behind left.
It's okay," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wearing felt hats, on which he heads "To to get drunk dressed!" and iron the naked behind against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a trad "oooooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his mug of beer from a liter drunk earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks it is a garbageter.
Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 pm the sanitary workers walk in herds on the square of the feast, which must take care of the poor beoni
Nurses appear each time in packs – always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered with a tent in a tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the tarpaulin in this coffin from the alcohol in the blood, can not be seen.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the sanitary ware yells and disappears in the chasm.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear is circulating on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bailout package temporarily collapsed the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of one-day-space points in its history.
The Down later recovered a little again.
At around 20:30 the world’s leading market barometer quoted/recorded with a good 5% in shortfall on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Tech Exchange was stagnant with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, it put us back just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
Goldman Sachs shares sold by just 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the big investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the feat.
The rescue plan had to be allocated the financial funds for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one fell swoop, but by degrees.
By reference the state had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate trend of the prices, to reduce the charge for the coffers of the State.
The course of action in Europe and the US in the vortex of the downside
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the US do not erase investor doubts.
The course of the shares of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate falls to the peak and tears the index of the German stock exchange down
The U.S. Dow Jones index loses us despite the planned financial market salvation through the state.
Spectacular loss of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank raced the German stock exchange index in deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender lost despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3-quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank sold more than 20%.
The index of the German DAX stock exchange slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% on 5,839 points.
World stock markets are on their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to bring financial markets back to the rise.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3% in the first business time to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout, the vote in the Senate was able to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also could only be a direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark index after initial profits had a shortfall of 1.26% out of 11,742.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1 % to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex bottom index lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
In the MDax they sell the shares of Arcandor after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to new shares in the amount of €23 million.
The business and tourism group has also announced that the stakes on the Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Matter disfects the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexities among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins’ general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that froze quickly, the death of freezing now looms over her.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon has been wreaking havoc – the Swing-by anomaly
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical gimmick as did the Ulysses solar probe.
What amazes scholars for years: rockets do not behave completely as one would expect according to the law on gravitation.
In fact, it comes to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the pull of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely exact.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and attempts to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only been aware for about 10 years.
From her evidently comes an attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is seen.
She herself is instead completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Abducted Tourists in Egypt Are Free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed
We are looking at their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safety, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 components of an expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstory of a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages are still unclear: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed on a ransom," the official said.
One would "still be treated to take over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded from Germany a ransom of 6 million euros; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men should have stayed held until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused a stance on the report.
Victim of an incident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on the Shenfield Road in the city on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
The abuses of the stepfather "brothered to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his stepmineas Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a little girl and she was living in Coventry, Trerise molested her and bandaged her before she had sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was plagued by the abuses they had caused her.
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, was "emotionally dead", and that she had "fold with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I tied her and the bandage."
“I didn’t sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
“This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he didn’t, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up before the court.”
I note the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy young successful."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged with the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
“They must have thought that this was being treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of more than 80,000 pounds after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money of savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general manager of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” that the companies and their members have to pay.
The 14-billion pounds loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest it will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering market of homes are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been far less cautious.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a meaningful account,” added Mr. Cole.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying their bills through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Turkey is Expanding Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole slightly decadent building.
But once inside the vaulted ceiling ticket office, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the transition further west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a laggard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly unraveling, vastly surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, we need - at least symbolically - to highlight the ever-greater diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
There is now a new policy of commitment.
Remarkably the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours after - after a rush to jump along the slopes that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by shopping centers half built and pastry shops of power, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
“The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point, "I ask, 'will Turkey be forced to decide?'
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to make that choice."
Then he emphasizes a point that almost everyone I spoke with here acted by heart: the ties of not only the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines east across Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at the time, there seemed to be no doubt about what continent were to make claims about this fascinating country.
Milk rises to 5 pence per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of her milk for an extra fivepence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers need to decide for themselves if they want to unload the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Denied bail to former Bangladeshi Prime Minister
A Bangladeshi court has refused a bail claim by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million takas ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many allegations of corruption hangs against you.
Sheikh Hasina’s long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the coming weeks but his party, Awami League, has called for the military-backed temporary government of the country to give it their total freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for word medical care, it is unclear according to the terms of her release, if she can stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he'll appeal to the Supreme Court against the Order of the High Court.
"The upper court refused the bail application for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have bail as she is already abroad about the word for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
He expects the return home of Sheikh Hasina after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military force-lined government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination schedule in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this happens despite the Taliban’s promises that would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB Losses Legal Battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to oblige the company to reduce its stake in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed an unjust influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in a 2006 deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB participation in ITV sows doubts about ITV's independence, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulators opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce it its ITV stake was unreasonable and a di di disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its vowing.
New investigation into the case of the US Prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the inspector general of the Department of Critical Justice the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate if the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Indicts on potentially criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or uncovered,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the lawyers dismissed had not been assessed more poorly than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and carry out lawsuits in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other officers in the Department of Justice quit.
(Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying she was primarily responsible for the dismissals, who had abdicated his role as leader and was extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush’s previous senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic inno Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will retire his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honored” to earn recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s awards, being on the nominee list in four categories.
Q magazine editor-in-chief Paul Rees said, “There are a few songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is without a doubt one of them.”
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15.
But the Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell album remained nearly nine years on the charts and went on sale more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, including an operation for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, sharp laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged who had a cyst on a vocal string.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossbars, some famous, others merely in use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and residents have long found it difficult to give Extra Place’s location, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from First Road – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the luxury building real estate company recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner step for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately quarter of the past.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which has street control, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the committee for the use of the land of the municipal commission of the district some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the way.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city’s hands, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
“There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access.”
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seats, including some to use for a café at which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay was buying the way was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that he wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Alloggi, said it was the city’s desire to sell the road and pointed out that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historical imprint.
Some believe it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
CBGB’s back door, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the cover set for the Ramones album “Rocket to Russia.”
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about East Village “gentrification,” opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, citing that the piece of public ownership, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a nearly no-matterd city fragment that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Speech in the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an august-out-and-top alley, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with shutters, with weeks old newspapers fluttering along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran nimbly through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lies near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little beautified.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in his current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in black, dirty and disgusting places. " "
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member of California’s studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school.”
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students, “which is true.
To combat these deficiencies in achieving goals, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students in the school are for the majority Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have arrived recently, are studying English.
But, among fourth-quarter pupils, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the top-level test in the 2008 Math State Exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-quarter pupils took the expert level test on the art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama’s favorite ingredient.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills, and an attitude like “no excuses.”
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach for English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “we had fantastic success with a newly-he had a student who had just come from Mexico and if you entered the class 12 months later you wouldn’t have been able to pinpoint what it was.”
"It works," he noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-time advocate of bilingual education) and her own continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr. Obama.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said people should stop worrying about “only-English.”
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the American bailout for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York merchant stock exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial unrest of Wall Street’s financial unrest, and from some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said it had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking operations, the government said on Monday.
At the same time the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations had led to a bailout deal “they appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a perspective of raw materials, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. " "
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter sets a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets' uniform over the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he watched the unfolding of Sunday’s second quarter, when the Jets turned a point-free game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the menacing clouds that overwhelmed them with a feeble game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tuning made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing tricks, the defense heavily hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a loose throw and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner Fumble.
The latest turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a goal from 20 yards, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When they were told both - the Jets conceded 21 points unanswered in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter more than the third."
There were a lot of dots in a little time.”
Gebrselassie rested exceeds his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again because many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a run of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shatters for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, held last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record of such a staggering career that he produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped Beijing’s Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively – that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-scored rockers like Gebrselassie and Kenya’s Paul Tergat have gone at long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the decades passed, since Ronaldo da Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s win, Gebrselassie told reporters that she had calves two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left it fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's east African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on trailblazers as if it were a half-bottomer race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon runner.
At a pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the trailblazers vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final surge to part with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
The Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she recovered to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a big gap, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extended theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city embedded in the country and Zora's birthplace Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, an abundance of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city he described – and that makes tourists stop by including it in the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project’s Florida tour guide – remains a place apart.
He is as independent, dignified and private as he was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider’s gaze.
“We’re very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historic black take-up model and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of southern blacks - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And concern about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five-paragraphs of Florida’s guide transformed the city, just outside Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama.
As low as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then deviates into more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "it is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora used to say it the way it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls whom Hurston immortalizes by citing men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family to her family who moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston swooped into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that even today boasts of decent clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were grinding.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. said. Franklin.
But, he added, rocking on his chair on the back patio above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely christened, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaque-free grave at Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies, and no major conference.
“I don’t think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 across the city's western edge.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his story.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had given an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people who sat on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a watermesh from a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
“Black children were used to being hugged – I remember this – you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening,” N said. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
“You didn’t hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there’s a cultural divide there,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudiced, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the Hurston’s plaqueless grave and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had again drawn the limelight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from his project on the street.
“The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what you would say the high-speed, a real pride for the city,” Ms. said. to Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the image that the city has of itself.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began reevaluating the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-story bookshop (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repainted and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a back road in the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for Eatonville’s story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission asked in advance is required for most interviews, some things – such as the murals on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields – are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a plump teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fears that their insular community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Humeston festival expanded, a high level of city pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, trouble and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
“A lot of people, if they just walked in here, they’ll think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to everyone else,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all fluently talk about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycomb above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst “bad day in the office” since the collapse of 1929.
The messengers shake metal trolleys for the tea through the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for meetings at breakfast.
Latino-Americans drag their feet between condominiums, bringing, like human mules, 50 and brokenty shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the speech of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned it to coincide with the late afternoon break at my branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions for the department store Macy and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already withdrawn savings from smaller banks from the places they commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They withdrew the money from the so-called thrift (a bit like a construction company), credit unions, and kinds of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and while New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, frightened by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers have become competent in finance in recent weeks.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her emaciate general manager Dick Fuld in all-familiarily, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge, almost fifty-year-old from my apartment building, has changed the subject of our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my shopping.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Remember Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As the musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrop, September 11) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under the age of 21, but at the time when the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years old - we simply refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that the music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself."
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
Everything is there in music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowering.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it rise more and more.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to knight a conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more, I’ve covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been at odds with just one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal grandeur and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his own words, simply "rid around the world one or two well-known workhorses."
He will miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a bachelor's degree in science, one in literature and a PhD".
This follows from the note from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university lecturer on economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950–51 in the U.S. as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don’t know.
Desecrated Muslim tombs while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like road representatives of mosques with a red line that passes in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in national general elections.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged at Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits traced Jewish symbols like the David Star over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by a hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is related in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a spiritual search journey following its right turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, citing that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was predominantly brought by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
A trip abroad banned from Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous star of rock guilty of child sexual abuse, has been forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities that they controlled him that they wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after he provided magistrates with evidence of earlier arrests of Glitter for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's court in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25 at the court in Ashford, Kent police have submitted an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s overseas trip to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of convicts for sexual offences.
He has to report to the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police seven days notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence to five years in prison.
Kent police said it did not want to discuss the individual cases or possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our perspective, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of the Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of convicted persons convicted of registered sex offences in the country to minimise any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he came, he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have passed it to the passport check and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on returning to England.
He eventually arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the court in Uxbridge, west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him in the register of convicted men of sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by travelling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract his character" G?nther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor dresses before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far from the audience, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Gonther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, seizing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day ever greater," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" they could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and to capture the audience.
To grasp the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco.”
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dancing, the singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotamata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about seventy artists portrayed.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, let alone a long or short moment.
I think portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters that sometimes you don’t even know or who allow you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, like a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotamata gallery, at number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gambling"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and deals with unknown subjects: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as per prediction, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an early edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend,” filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience whose time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, has evoked how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined way" to compensate for the "inconstruction"and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that “there is no way” to measure and know if books can change people’s lives, “but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience,” said Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, “it has effects” and that “makes people more nonconformist.” For this reason he invited writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for one's vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The celebration of the bullfights that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for bullfighting had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of bullfighting.
The weather raged against this Festival preventing them from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfighting.
The bill included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who was supposed to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival had regular conduct only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being taken out in triumph, after having toreato with taste and aesthetics.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights, receiving greetings and one ear, granted more by the public than thanks to the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing by the arena of Los Llanos without glory and pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the whistles of much of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint to Alava
Five minus 10 in the morning.
The agents warn the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they flee.
The officers ordered the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they fled.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A. A. A. J., according to the statement of the Department of the Interior of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava roadway were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armian.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, accelerated sharply and passed the checkpoint.
The officers tracked each other until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The agents of the Ertzaintza were then able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they transported and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish loaves, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were later put into police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials ascertained that the freshman had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the documentation of the van, the arrested was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The inmate A. A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of medication.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, according to People magazine by a spokesman for the Californian road.
The witness specified that around 4.30pm Locklear "crashed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth. Reversing, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance, apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services because “he was concerned about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It looked confusing," and for this reason the officers led her to a specialist drug and alcohol center to put it on a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved to be cooperative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was discarded from the beginning, although "according to what officers were observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear had been re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the party Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been councillor in the Sevigliano council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. “The UI has always wanted this kind of investigation to have maximum transparency.”
He likewise stressed that the training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de mayo", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdas’s Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director attempted to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr? at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become a television miniseries of more than four hours in the future on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdas' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 medrilegno. The director had agreed on the condition that the story based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and customs to portray a "a stunned Spain that wrong the choice of the leader for whom to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" noted Garci.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double compared to Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes planned by the scenography that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what's happening in the industry where he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom fall into the cast of Sangre de mayo, prove in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Oscar nominee four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos -, do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
Garci does not expect awards from this film.
“At first you believe you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to simply shooting an extra film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
An Sevillian dancer pays tribute to another dancer in Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three he moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of the female emancipation, the likes of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
“I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character. It seemed incredible to me."
The dancer supports: "we do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect its spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance de la mariposa" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance de la serpiente" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic,” he explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of her shows, as she does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The staging also includes musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Moron; the percussions of El Pjaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Ju?rez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been full-blown divas, and who have always had many spas."
In the work there is also present in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, habitually, resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her or even less considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will start today, at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Reciencasado Poeta" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramon Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award for the Nobel Prize.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramon Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, will arrive in the New York.
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poeta Reciencasado", curated by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and work of one of the highest value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives an idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
It cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And you also knew he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I’ve now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cries, “my life and my country could have been better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died in a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and well remain people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and defeated lawsuits, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his elder son who died of a drug at the creation of the home and organic brand food.
You all give to a country that cost you far to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man did not die, an era ended.
Another Englishman, an Oscar-winning director, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to call Paul Newman his biggest inspiration.
“He left an example of the highest level for all of us,” notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and having a serious and distant private life to the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once, but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful, certainly not lacking the opportunities to not be.
"Why do I go out today to eat burgers out, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles she played, no one was so proud of him as a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were then taken into account at the time of the assessment and I was the one to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the backbone, which assumed that it went earlier.
It didn’t sound like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, that’s to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid the queues during the race).
But no.
You had to go just to take the ridge (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! had only size 'S' t-shirts (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inezies compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to take the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was to be expected, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in order correctly because of the chip that, I suppose did not record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not fit into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented a new image recognition and human interaction system, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move around the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this “receptionist” is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are – including remembering their location in the company – and listening to and understanding the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be available to her shortly.
All without blue screen screens.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week there was a lot of talk about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster — hey! Steve, it's going to be "the least."
A whole discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added functionality and "extra" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one who supported the theory that was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Make the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to tell your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time surfing the network than in a remote window environment.
What is half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to be a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and bring back a small example here.
I took the picture in this post in one of the recreation venues for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soft drink machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future.”
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search the network.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will look for a joint launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forced star with the pointed mustache that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the cotton inside, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, even if, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt wear as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models bear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retrò boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara T-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing meant to be comfortable.
And it’s a shame to use them as underwear.
They are too good.
Second assault for Honda supersales
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
To everything must be added a refined mechanics, which increases the driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over a year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the decline in sales in Spain by good measure.
In fact, the company’s managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do so, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the entirety of 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage stems on the one hand from the inclusion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the luggage capacity – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, or 19 litres plus the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements – in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass – are an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, open in fact at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in the models with 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows it to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time maintains high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model allows you to take advantage of a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first-generation model used 83 horses, 100 are now available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
“I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the fashion industry very seriously.
For Monica, they are more than just beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we created my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
What are your new collection for Mango from in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to lose myself in the city and observe how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you are a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything flows and there are many elements in common.
I, since I was a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rummaging through my aunt's closets and seeing her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid close attention to dressing.
You know that the dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the moment you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not so long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
But no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making less of mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted since I was a child and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me and also I want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with much love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for several films shot to come out in theaters last year.
That's right, and I have a lot of desire to come out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want you to leave "La l'tima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
See if you like them
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Women for a better world" and the clothes we exhibited - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
They say so much about her, that I know her for a long time I can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I am with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it is to help third world women, you cannot back down.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as an example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Centre developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer’s vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle above 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what they called a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects obstacles that are facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“At a time when it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right or larger angles to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which they can turn its wheels and not exploiting infinite directions and ways like bees do.
For this reason, the Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of the pre-trial maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega.”
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for the instant prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan wants will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Repetiated drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in your car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of intoxication or if you do not blow into the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General of State, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
This initiative, in addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, will be attended by the Directorate General of Traffic Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Sicurezza dell’Automobile (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once for drunk driving back to driving the car.
The alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a concentration of alcohol is detected higher than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be charged to the sanction.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow to reduce by up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviour before criminal killings become.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
On British time, at 5.40 p.m., the second programme, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were travelling, landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced the hand to use their hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to charge people at the time... She's from here or...
No, no sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 Navy soldiers who offer the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, a windy hair, very sober, does not use her usual "peeptoes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City he threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the room where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty reporter of Mexican television awaits them.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in banks at dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or problems.
The bleak appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce to think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is in-depth.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, a songo room in the hotel appears.
It's still something, because buying a better house not if it doesn't even talk...
The best reward offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, which not Paris and probably does not exist a more exquisite and bont designer Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot?n-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in Mango's window at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite canvases, Mango’s presidential gala table was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some ELAH complements to take the breath and arm of his son Luis - a big boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the pay-as-pain dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as a knight who is finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had yielded them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – drawn of her hand – turned into dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet sages and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a “grand plie”.
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the building, but had shown us before the photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big boy who moves in motion – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had made sure previously, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the frenetic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer pain of back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the effort to disengage from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calmness will reach bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to win calm in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this "manual" denies this conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline does not already flow in your veins to regain the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in the sleep
Some children speak at night.
I’m not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak while remaining asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you take a fright, but in reality it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep alteration called somniloquy.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have told you that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in the month ...), the day after the baby no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, nighttime fears, night enuresis (peeping in bed), or somnambulism, but it is not necessarily so.
As mentioned above may be associated with very high fever stages, stressful or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (scream, cries, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any question that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situation).
What can be done, however, is to consider a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child excessively before he goes to sleep.
Propose peaceful games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepers appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
- Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and would interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is best to consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to get information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not see what it is dreaming about to say it, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions at night to know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
Such a thing causes a lot of anguish.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found the way to win at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-neri created the most chances from a goal, turning one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers spoke with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to get the better and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn alto, Romain at the top and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a blockade in the center of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in the tip of attack.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and soon after Marais' first goal for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, he resumed a repulsed ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, backed just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a daring action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant their representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "they will be present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the working conditions and pay of sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy at the standstill.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections with Belle-Ele were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula, a roadblock was implemented.
On Monday the sailors have already shown their determination by burning, starting from dawn, tires and vanillas in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took hold in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the pier, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire-Atlantique, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will in fact decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, who have not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "there are "no intention to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with diesel less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
The Embraer maintains the delivery forecast in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the recessionary threats that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest company in the world in the sector, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is largely trusted in the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.

AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The insurance company American International Group, resigned by the U.S. monetary authorities, would divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times’ Sunday edition.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper specifies on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to review any supplies, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to divest include the air lease International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on such transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the U.S. authorities take possession of 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting history
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives voted against the Paulson plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a decline never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst of losses in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological stocks, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the enlarged index Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it could already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were actually moribund ... then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – and to the other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And highlighting again the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia banking activities by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent action in favor of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis", added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bonds has regressed to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday evening, while the one with a maturity of 30 years is 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share of 21% stake in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its shares on the stock exchange.
A week after a provisional agreement was drafted, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at an individual cost of $2.25, or a sum of three billion dollars.
The set price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars in stock, or a percentage lower than its current course of 28%.
At about 17.00, Morgan Stanley stock fell 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley into bank holding company,” said John Mack, the group’s general manager.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its actions by making them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than previously assumed.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: “We thought our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will get Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about $ 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of approximately 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has been soaring.
Cost that equated on Monday, however, remaining at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" between the big investment banks on Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had collected $15 billion, partly at the Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa à Quito, ceundi.
To base the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, of the Bolivian Evo Morales and of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a voting basis of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white ballots.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of polling stations and an estimate by a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chavez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially of the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, will have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to exploit this amendment and to re-propose its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the president began to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama ahead of the first televised duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two candidates for the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though deserving, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to curb the drop in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives an advantage of five points to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat got the better of it.
An instant poll conducted by CBS News on a sample of undecisive voters found that 39 percent of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% bet on McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama’s advantage on Thursday.
“To underestimate it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing the opponent’s “naivety” about the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that... he has often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and expertise to become president,” he said.
What has been a continuing target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would be a new future.
Without going long, he proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” a Democratic commercial retorted this weekend, rebuked the Republican for failing to take the necessary steps to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an election meeting.
He didn’t even say the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial crisis goes to Obama’s favor, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” he said yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama’s economic intuition to that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming its intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street gasps, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of the country’s possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for its part, would build a fleet of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dodged the applications focused on the $700 billion financial bailout (€470 billion) adopted Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they didn’t even vote: “What for? They will do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression in front of foreign observers with the aim of resuming in dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic turning point.
The sanctions, including a visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of votes," complained Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of facade, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case it is the executive.
If opposition deputies enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "we must start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the ‘organization for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the ballot.
He points out that the participation shares seem too high, and that the generalization of voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to any kind of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, the most convenient in power."
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The 19 Hostages Released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight accompanying persons abducted ten days ago.
- I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, safe and sound, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were freed in Chad from an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, at about 3.30 pm, aboard a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interview to the press, at the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom was paid "to the kidnappers", Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed by one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organizing agency.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, just before dawn.
"There were gunfire, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the perpetrator who requested to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos would support them.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any other details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army said it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were and killed six, including the chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the movement for the Liberation of Sudan, (SLAU), an affirmation immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will pronounce to denounce the mellow sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that monuments and heritage buildings are neglecting?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we have no real laws that actually preserve our assets?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon, in the Loire valley?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, at least 40 000 volunteers, grouped into 211 companies for the protection of the historical, genealogical heritage, archives and assets of assets preserve, with four dollars, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The meeting - Blood is safe again
The Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as the Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public’s trust, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a drama and the population protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, this mandate was implemented by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the next few years, we regained public confidence,” he explains before saying that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Québec’s population had confidence in the Heéma-Québec.
Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, the Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the story of her who has been chaired since 1998, the year of its foundation.
“And we didn’t know at all whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for a few years, it has been proven that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the same, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to a duration of less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them has thus significantly decreased.
These improvements have made it possible to considerably reduce the risk of getting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people run the risk of receiving infected blood from HIV.
“In other words, this means that you will need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since the Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is found.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the management of the Hema-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known what pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to having safe resources, the Heéma-Québec must also provide enough.
“Necess increase as the population ages.
As the cures against cancer are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average makes up only 3% of Quebec-friendly inhabitants as donors."
However, all healthy people who are over 18 years of age and meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that can meet the needs of hospitals.
Cases of scarcity are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and to incite them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood,” says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, the Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eye-globi heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the inclusion in the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand of them every year.
We should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to have access to them", as the Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals of Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A's eliminatory, winning 3-1 against the Sounders in Seattle, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without goals from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Recall that at the first match of the first round, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the second leg by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for the victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory the only goal signed by Kovalev.
“I’m not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to overdo it in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation.”
Charest points to the North
The prime minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the end of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected at today’s partial elections.
"Expanding the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Quebec Liberal Party.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mulino a immagini".
On three maxi screens, they confused spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, Quebec images seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Big means as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister says has for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timelines or investment quotas, as well as he did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At most, he limited himself to pointing out what he believes deserves a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure has experienced several improvements.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
That "large territory twice as big as France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
Quebec's foundations are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at a press conference.
“It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement in a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
Moreover, "considering climate change, we must re-evaluate the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about it and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the FP of UNgava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) takes on an important position, has started work.
The prime minister does not rule out a great meeting," not necessarily a summit, but a time when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would subsequently stick to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who have gone before us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that nationalized hydropower, in Bourassa, creator of the Bay James, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference, conservative this time, was used by the program "Streats to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Facing the project related to the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest has specified that its commissioning would be previewed for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it," he confessed to his militants, arousing applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not discard the possibility of starting a ballot in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, especially on a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly as oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the sketch of the North Plan was received skeptically.
The leader of the FP, Pauline Marois, dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, "we would have progressed today", commented Marois alongside the candidate of the Jean-Talon (scrutinium that took place today), Francoise Mercure.
The AQ said it supported the government’s adoption of the North Plan.
“What we hope for is not just being perceived as a show,” said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont’s replacement, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (Ironically) of Harper's Cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoling in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the prime minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated one of its imprisoned citizens in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the facts were imputed to him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and let a child-soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadra in order to be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes the eyes in front of torture: it matters little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We don’t realize it yet, but we’re seeing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom, and “democracy,” a word that Harper doesn’t stop flaunting and that sounds so senseless on her lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any morality: one can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now a minority head of government (to see what will become after October 14...).
Numerous electors believe that a party that preaches Virtuous, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here is the shame, mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. by Patrick J. Garver, vice-president, director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend a substantial amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these effortless gunfights, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that muzzles the opposition as well as frightening anyone or pronouncing themselves again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates usually take place with the exchange of opinions and not with batons.
It would have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and calmly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a “public” debate when his contempt for that same public is evident?
In the world of vice-president, it seems that this word only refers to the lawyers handsomely paid and not the set of Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of gagging (seeing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum ordering them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the lawsuit filed by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies en bloc the right to citation of authentic sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work itself.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss issues uncomfortable with the richest companies in the world, under pain multiple lawsuits, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific norms as the authors of Canada Nero do.
He has a right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, is able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that can limit unfair lawsuits.
Operation - bailout for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democrat side, yesterday finally came to an agreement on the largest bailout plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion US plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been weighing on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses foreclosed for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on wages paid to managers of the protected companies.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision was made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“It’s the crux: if we didn’t act this way, invaluable disheartened and upset would have spilled over the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit granted was the opening of markets this morning.
Later in the negotiations, the two presidential candidates in the US presidential elections were rather in favour of the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama goes well for adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to keep their domicile and that inherent in the salaries intended for state-covered business managers.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the screen of the American TV.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, “I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so.”
“According to what I’ve read, it’s something we all have to digest and that will allow us to move on.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to repurchase with taxpayers’ money doubtful loans, risk assets and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led first of all to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (mortgage), and then extends to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leads to the freezing of liquidity and the ens running of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who were in charge of blowing up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some companies in need be only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, Congress, a provision has been added to which, if the government were to cope with losses over the next five years due to that program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which it will still be added 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of $350 billion is expected to be ratified by a further congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the foreclosure procedures related to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, he is still not sure that the green light is given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Evidently, Washington doesn’t hear you,” he said, addressing his constituents, Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way to go,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again witnessing the world nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas said it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
“It’s not the money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In return, they collect influence and right to vote in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are announced uncertainly.”
During this time, at the other end of the English Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalizing another bank poised for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently underway at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that she will buy the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time its ace up its sleeve, for others its weak spot.
Had he got rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, at his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last American film icons of the glories years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also spokesman for the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples, magic children are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, last mark of quality.
As he was recognized as a whole country in love with the safe made man, the Pacific War fighter, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
That same civil rights activist was also the racing driver who finished second in the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbols, although part of a model couple from 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star go away with him, allergic to the scandals of show-business, which will never be able to completely reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend the passing of Paul Newman was a dive to the heart for cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is repeated through its interpretations.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to wish his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof Hencated by Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused in the memory.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in There someone loves me, of Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute thwarves in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in The Spaccone, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him the only Oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face through the years was his.
And again he.
The ages are happening through its path.
The young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot-Hand Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle ended with a last role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Era my father, in 2003.
Unlike the most popular movie legends that soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its pomp, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French cinemate, called him, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like a godsend.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young act: neurotic characters, carcastred or desperate characters, of which he expressed in disgrace and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time, 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, he drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated the film Harry and Son to the film in 1984, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes that rained down yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade-dweller Robert Redford (they had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood drift is extinguished.
We will have distorted his face to stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the revenue from that sales was earmarked for his Foundation for Children in Difficult.
Newman, instead of lying on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And equally privilege it was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag invoice factory & partners?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against Junos Zuschlag and partners will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from tenders, was used by them for private purposes, and have often certified the performance of activities through false invoices.
State and municipal money, a total of 65 million florins, ended up in part in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from notices of competition on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the accusatory act, most of the bills were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were bought at the market in J?zsefv?ros, but the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established by the way during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where J?nos Zuschlag had sent Istvan Lados.
According to the latter's confession, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, on the model of these then the invoices to be forwarded to the calls for tenders, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest were prepared.
Most of these are the work of Istvan Lados and Andr?s?ri, who, according to our information, has drawn up above all the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of the "journey studies" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the place of catering provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyes?let Association.
So many people, however, according to what the restaurateur says, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Foundation J?v?ért, later named Egy?tt in Harmadik ?vezredrt, is teeming with formal errors and content.
A pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fancy bills exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., also deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents in the name of the companies Jobb Jav?ért and Hopp?.
Gyuzo Farkas, director of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him his invoices, he immediately understood that these were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT number of our enterprise were in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact did not come back that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the invoice was of catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for some time.
The assiduous compilers of invoices did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment travels to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's invoices.
In addition, as shown during the survey, the VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempted VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf?l?p Kft. in favor of the Jobb foundation J?v?ért, in fact, on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices indicated on the invoices, in addition, the employees of the hotel issued only invoices printed, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, the "emitters" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company have indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known by the Prosecutor's procedure, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Moreover, for formal defects - non-compliant invoice format, fake stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Egytta in Harmadik ?vezrert Alap?tv?ny, of XXI. Sz?zadi Kultur?lis Egyes?let and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért? Sports Field, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices in question.
The forgers did not pay any attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny?regyhaza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Varosért Egyes?let, for this reason the liquidator of the company, according to our information, denied having issued that invoice.
They made invoices consciously
Another group of issuers of invoices is those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap?tv?ny Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj? Szocialist?k in favour of the Egy?tt foundation in Harmadik ?vezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Gyorfi, one of the defendants, according to the prosecutor, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious bills.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and partners the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million guilders to the Jobb foundation J?v?ér?t Alap?t?ny, the Atlasz Egyes?let association and the association V?r?sfeny? Egyes?let, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the invoices prepared were then reversed, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who can be connected with the defendants.
Ad exetings. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to deliverance by the director general of the Delta Tri? Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer vehicles, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 bought these invoices.
The director-general of this firm was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
According to Kubatov, during the investigation, he acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hopp? and Egy?tt in Harmadik ?vezredért Alap?tv?ny, and the equivalent was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons, the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kt.
Indeed, however, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies have returned useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued to the associations linked to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Gener?ci?.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri?, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office considers that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition notice.
Y-Gener?ci? and Sz?vetség at Modern Magyarorsz?gért in January 2006 presented a call for the Socialist Party's public benefit agency, Toncsics Mih?ly Alap?tv?ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the call.
In order for this not to come to light, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received by the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Erpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, Junos Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have also offended for now since his requests to ease his conditions of imprisonment, that is, the granting of house arrest, have not found a hearing so far.
While the perpetrators of non-recommended commercial crimes and much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which he is not granted.
The psychology of excess liking: Why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are inclined to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists, researchers at the University of New York have managed to uncover the neuro-economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study in the journal Science, men don’t want to be left behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they’re willing to pay a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental rods.
One group of volunteers played the lotto, the other group of players participated in an auction while with the functional magnetic resonance imaging method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brains of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the game of the rod, in which the substantial element is to licit more than the other, the striped body under the cerebral cortex enters intensively function when it is lost in the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in the price is explained by the vehement reaction of the striatum body.
To support their theory, the research group’s economists carried out a financial pursuit survey.
In this survey, three groups set up against a partner under different conditions.
They reported to the control group how much was the real value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group, in addition to this, they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group, on the other hand, would have received $15 before the auction, but the group members would have lost the money in the event of an auction loss.
The difference between the two groups was that one of them was underlined the win, while the loss was underlined.
Proven the neurologists hypothesis, the members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to make higher bets of the control group or "winning".
“These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These in fact so far explained the phenomena found at the auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but chronic liver disease is mentioned in Hungary among the leading causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis virus spreads in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the alimentary canal (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to get vaccinated against the virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after consuming infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and white of the eyes, the feces become light and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease is worth turning to the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize a part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, who ended up in difficulty first in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, also involving the president of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of difficulties in which the international financial market has been struggling for more than a year has been debating, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then presented themselves in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares on Friday fell nearly 12 percent, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices, the group’s entire capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s executives this value is not real.
The top management blames the collapse of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the $700 billion US plan.
On Monday, the title slowly resumed rising.
Filip Dierckx was named the bank’s new CEO on Friday.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid to lose their money.
Among the bank’s customers, the panic did not spread, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns its own autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of the Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in the god affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph said.
As part of the bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which in addition to academics also include scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University.
The test took place exactly like this: a tool that emits discharges and passes the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci’s ermine painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo’s painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time arus they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the painting on the form of religious or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of" them and "reassured and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religiously-themed image, they gave an account of 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work ahead of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but it is necessary to find the right image.
“We need to look for an image that has very positive feelings, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality.” – Wright added.
After the excellent results, does only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a virgin Mary of quality bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On their tenth birthday, Google can claim to be as much in people’s pockets as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which clinic they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is not enough yet.
What concerns skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “we insert all the information in the world into a system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt replied: he would like if Google knew how to answer questions like “what do I do tomorrow?” or “what would be the right job for me?”, but the software can’t answer seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their searches on the internet exactly the words searched are recorded, from which IP address they are searched for and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, they can concern what they have searched and clicked, these in the long run will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our preferences declared and recorded previously recorded.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - people are asked about the monopoly of Google's data.
In most cases the counter-reactions of internet users are caused by the fear of the potential power represented by the company, and not because of guilt, fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion against power.
However, a fact is confirmed and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases it does not defend the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against the pedophiles of Brazil, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users worried about personal rights instead sucked in relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later we cannot force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully snatched almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years earlier, but still failed to get the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data lash Google because they believe that so its intimate sphere and private life is affected by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appeared in numerous countries see in them the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft dismissed as the world's conqueror because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code always kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the key words repeated most often in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 talks about nothing but about collaboration, to intentionally leave traces behind us and exploit the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, he can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can insert them into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa appear automatically.
Meanwhile, we read about numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, easily learns with those who spent the night her perfidious boy or a company can fire an employee of her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the top of the company: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live a life online make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google’s monopoly can do so (starting for example with Scroogle using Google’s search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not comment on community pages not to be found, Google’s online applications, from word processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion awaits even so much in secret the moment when Google pulls out its claws.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth of value is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agency revenues, record-breaking services cause big malaises not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development firms.
However, critical observers alongside all this find alarming points: the top management, for example, has completely rejected the protest of employees after doubling the tuition of the company's asylum, has deemed too expensive the repeated catering at the pleasure of the employees, all this, however, belittles in the face that in 2006 Google has bowed the head of the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter out all the results that offend the good taste of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, however, one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world in one place: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon be in front of the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this way we can create a health care.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the short film tale of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped the double murderer of Ozd to make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Police Police Headquarters of the Borsod region.
The young people have recognized the crime against them, currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, defend themselves on the loose.
Abetting is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was put in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of multiple premeditated murders committed for profit.
The investigation showed that the young 23-year-old had a big debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he deceived his creditor at a construction site in Ozd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information of the MTI, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the share list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that they intend to sell within a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the offer of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have submitted an offer the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank ?esk? Spo?itelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has taken place thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact its party behind a hastily a hastily amp, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire super-financer Warren Buffett has said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees in Washington the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more and from this will suffer from it later the whole world.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the major transformation of capitalism’s history is unfolding.
It is no longer possible to neglect the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today may still offer a rescue doughnut to staggering financial institutions and taxpayers’ money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, EU member states must outweigh their national egoism and focus control over dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday, the weakened financial institutions obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties seem increasingly real that even European taxpayers, similar to those of the American ones, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "savers" must not immediately wave the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they established in what case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent bigger damage.
Intelligent machine imitates the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies if not imitating the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
For example, those of bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, hornets gave the initial strategic inspiration to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini car with bee properties, with the final aim of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks very much like our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR and R&D technologies sector.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a view of 300 degrees in every direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's sight.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaged and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of stezenability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to avoid the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and higher energy density, which means that their lifespan is longer than lithium-ion ones.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvering data, so it uses only a memory of a few dozen Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, foreseen at Nissan, within 10 years it can be installed on standard vehicles.
Further application possibilities may be unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which, avoiding obstacles on the road, leads to its destination.

The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law has been drafted for the purchase of disproportionate claims, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to the East Coast timetable, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout after a debate that had lasted for days.
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, said Nancy Pelosi, who said she only remained to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not the Wall Street bailout but the inversion of the economic tank.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m., Washington (at 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), but did not bring large stock exchange growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft defined economic stabilization law of 2008 regarding the program, after it will be the Senate.
by President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House on Saturday night.
We are pleased with the progress we have achieved tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after Monday’s vote of Congress, with these the Ministry of the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind it, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will control the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can apply a combined tactic: it can buy credits, mortgages and mortgage securities and other types of "poisoned" credits at the same time:
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - they have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal standard makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the probable damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their exit, defined by the overseas slang simply as a gold parachute.
Payment limitations will only take place in some cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys in the context of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate receivables, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not exaggerated.
To this it must be added that the already existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of the general administrators - the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the commission responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives, commented on the measure.
In addition to this, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn if the economy, and along with it the bank saved, will get back on its feet.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal that has to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us, not to defend taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Rep Heitor Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same ones that are responsible for the Wall Street crash.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Goncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement could come into force around January 12 - the Foreign Minister spoke of this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion "it now all depends on the fact of the fact of the overseas, the electronic system of entry and control is built in time".
However, it has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be a permit to enter, but before departure tourists will have to register.
The Hungarian diplomacy manager will continue negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Medal of the Order of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will engage with talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates for the two big American parties, on Sunday guaranteed their support for the $700 billion government plan for bank bailing out, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury minister.
Representatives of Congress and administration after the marathon negotiations that lasted for days, announced on Sunday night that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bank bailout.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market financial package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suited than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the foreground of economic issues, Obama has again recovered some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment as vice president of Sarah Palin, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill on the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that were also supported by him.
“Now we must act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He didn’t let himself escape to define McCain’s economic ideas outweighed.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that "all of us will send this situation down with difficulty ... but doing nothing is not a viable path".
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a control committee of the minister of finance and the limitation of the good exits of the top managers, things on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a role of merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on Monday for a bill.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters became more self-aware - analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider’s party is ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have modernized Bavaria for decades, and just now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a trial ended that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had plummeted to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 again in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the modernization carried out in a consequent way in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted it already 40 years ago, but they were very time wrong. But the secularization, the results of education, the establishment of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, artisans, graduates and graduates.
Here the support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese Conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" he deals with the confused internal political situation of Austria created following the elections.
The SP intends to deal with the VP.
The VP prohibits the intervention of the SP in its internal affairs.
The BZA is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by public television the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP, has confirmed that he wants to deal with the VP.
The SP wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the VP, as vice chancellor.
As he stated, the Schoessel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
Repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted prudently to red offerings.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the VP.
If his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still open to the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the VP.
J?rg Haider leader of the BZ? has repeated that it is open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for governing,” Haider said.
Juraka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris began the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
The Fidesz deputy of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the congress called attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and moreover the most serious obstacle for their statement.
French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner Vladim?r ?pidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the parliamentary group, J?r?ka, recalled, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that Roma are being ousted from the labor market in the first place because of their low schooling.
“Most young Roma have no average level of education and as a result of poor quality elementary teaching only a negligible number of them can achieve a higher degree of education.”
He also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in Roma children’s education can mean strengthening the economy of EU member states.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to make these links aware in the wider scope of the Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma begins, the more the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow; through taxes paid for income and consumption, they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right of European Roma citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said L?via J?r?ka.
According to the congresswoman, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason the right respect for existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, the opportunities given by the democratic space must be given to the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of Europe's future," he said.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit organized every year, since last year's meeting in Berlin is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, insurers on life and health, based on people’s medicinal purchasing data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program that the use of drug prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the data subject.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
The insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims to the health status of the possible customer and if they consider too high the risk do not take out insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was stipulated only after the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper process: according to the customer identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program shows what diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is in.
If you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice incurably high and is classified in the higher risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, to the insurer so in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons there are that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance-commercial point of view, is worth as a risk factor, the first two not.
For the request and data processing, apart from companies were formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities oblige them to do so even if so far they have not imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies recently also process the result of laboratory tests and connect them to the treatment data in order to provide a more precise image of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and in parallel the control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the supervisory competence authorities to companies specialized in service data.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the transmission of data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not stipulate the contract.
So then at the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October the fate of the angry couple Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the ugly electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the moment.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Gunther Beckstein still remain in his place, the question is as long as pity lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians said in any case that they were not attached with all their might to the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union won 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they dropped to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy are always counting, in the future they will be forced to unite in any way.
As a first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice president and federal minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, obtains a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exponents of right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange twist of fate in the list of Free Voters enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treating without regard to the woman of great ambitions.
The CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also get an active role, which until now was plotting in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called the 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some clary statements to the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is not set up with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not adversely affect the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats, on the other hand, still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even an opposition representative entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers it is a sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it explains with the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) really hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections held in discussed circumstances, "given" a few seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up a previously evaluated boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, who asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in the possession of the Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
It referred to a détente that the OSCE evaluating the election campaign has placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE’s fast report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition presidential candidate of the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remains despite the fact that "the power was afraid of letting even a single opponent in a parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions for the results but rather tries to send voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the most officially helped class, that of pensioners, considers the regime of Lukashenko adequate that considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the economic deficit it is only a matter of time to the disintegration of social security "remembering the sepulchral silence" - considers Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marsery Menu
EU and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners who trade above all mutually, the agenda of the ninth meeting at the summit was also dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union acknowledges the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more people should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member in the UN Security Council.
So there was no insistence on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, that is, to increase trade to 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have legally unified, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU’s partners.
The summit paid attention to global matters.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the commercial Doha Round, even though both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be made at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today will travel to the French capital where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris it is hoped that to build Indian nuclear reactors the French companies will receive a order worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries for this edition, occupying the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author’s books on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children, progressively decreases.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure starts against the cunning, against those who stamp and then go for a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-phannulloni novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services", specifies the minister.
“Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta points out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistance from the employees, assures the Secretary General: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months the sick leave of civil servants has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people at work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile thousands of public employees have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Function today flaunted numbers about the least absenteeism at work for causes of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of 'inpersistent squintsans' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are the correct and productive employees of the public administration who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree.
In particular, the TAR will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for infirmity dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Accidents work, Napolitano: "Crocial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains a major cause of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, a mutilated and disabled national association of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "living appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"There has risen, of course, an indignant 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, for their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality re-proposes us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people who approach the world of work.
It is right to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to give up in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment aimed at urgently putting an end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not like, in fact, that this "downward trend" translates into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention loosens that the tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at a general level too little is still done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, greater controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this starting from the world of school.
"We need a further effort - he added - regarding communication and the awareness of public opinion.
But we need, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection provided for the victims of work" and the "caspray assistance to which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who get injured should not depend on spontaneism or donation from time to time ordered from the legislator".
Mp3 readers under indictment, put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music over an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recent-identified Health Risks (CSRRS) of the EU, published today.
"This scientific opinion shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day, keeping the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity".
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - continues the EU leader - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public knowledge.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they have given.
“Scientists confirm that there is concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music equipment and related equipment.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
You can greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the currently current limits on the maximum missed noise at work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the works of the "Commission for the future of Roma Capitale", which took office this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalize the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the Council and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so as to be able to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are represented all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno stresses - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, can then be availed.
There is no overlapping of roles but only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time term.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of the newspaper and on the emergencies that from time to time are tried.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously at the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a bandwagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap in level, which it needs absolute need, thinking with a unified spirit of its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. This is why
A well-known American politician wrote in an independent statement: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks against Obama are increasing just as the date of the elections approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big tough face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!”
In fact they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know well who will give his vote the American patriot.
A side of the American mentality kept covered to the last comes out.
“Say what you want, then we’ll take care of where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his term? Eighty percent responded: Iraq.
It's changing America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak point.
George W’s place will have a huge task to do.
USA, the economic collapse is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mind control in the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly declare that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they used to be.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a broken economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten seniors newspapermen and executives are convinced that the nationwide gymnasm is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a way to the internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of the printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it “does something good” for their journalism.
The biggest split today in American journalism is between those who direct the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “job security.”
Executives who think they lose their jobs in 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
Managers almost always receive big wages, while the editor can earn even $100,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to get to 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are “humbled” often during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNALE ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESSTA A GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-cock on the Unipol-Bnl climb.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained his release from the domiciles transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the journey from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the prosecutor gave the contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday informs us that the ongoing crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "Wash" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, in fact, who became overbearing alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is just an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the economic earthquake in progress perhaps heralds or already allows us to see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena in incubation that in the new climate are solidified and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary relaunch, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, full links with foreign countries, but which, above all, see the budgets of people and families who live in a single country, in a single state, involved in a very large measure.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the game or not having much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which is divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all disbursement of funds: since when you get to the corners are only the States that own the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back on track.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization can ever dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the national-state-national element is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to deal increasingly with those very unintangible things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the earth but are still absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that portends a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take matters into his own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, proved so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of countries in the West.
That is, it seems to make more and more course, in large sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly extraneous to the opinions of majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, underground feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "electoral revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of the latter and very last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep strata of Western societies today and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, is potentially unsuniing agitation.
Faced with all this, talking about a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is not at all.
The superglue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It’s the goal of several American research centers and now a team from four institutes has come very close to us.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall glued.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of gechi, covered with microscopic hairs that are able to ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily detaches itself from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING ON MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient sticker," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be about aerospace engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
ALTRA RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to finding a new sticker.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed by microfibers like hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the effectiveness with even serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, eliminating the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already come under fire because it was held responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, antihisymoitis, antihistamines and neurological effects to be considered toxic.
The Italian Agency of the drug had reported it in an information bulletin two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what is drunk in the event that you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually improve the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not be impressed but ask for clarification from the doctor or pharmacist", stressed the expert to the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s choices in economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was reproached to the economist, but which has now proved to be correct.
“I am surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the attention of the public,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a popularizer with a "very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most popular Microsoft Office.
After almost a year work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised and rendered less spartan interface, more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files in the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "Hybric PDF" documents, which connect the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some features of OpenOffice to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English one that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a driving force for the diffusion in homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also the realities that offer a training, consulting and assistance service ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding wording of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulo presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber jersey.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity to Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian finished on the final podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey of best climber.
IMMIGRATI:NEW YORK TIMES IS THEY IS IT RACIS?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asked in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Fabre who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the NYT calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "the most integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support to the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Even the new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendency underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Steve Fossett's plane found the billionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 3000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that still remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is precisely what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he told a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found in the plane or the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was killed dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transportation Security (Ntsb) said that a few hours after the bulletin was sent a team of investigators, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, lost since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some Fossett’s belongings had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents under the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett’s research was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour of a balloon: two weeks off-staired flight.
Three years later he had traveled around the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, advertising that you don't expect
An SUV out of the box with an original design and well defined by strong lines, large surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the latest born among the "compact" off-roads of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of fresh air in this sector.
Precisely for its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D billboard campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A maxi-signal project, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central Via dello shopping in Milan, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in an almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it be able to tantalize the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
This is who are the Italian hooligans
Del Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of which the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years and that so far, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The group extraction is right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added groups (a few units, in reality) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact checked them all: among those parties for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented the trip.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but of the whole of Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully. Thank you.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those just over a hundred and fifty, others may be added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes well open especially in view of the national team match on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, of the secret services, which deals precisely with the stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime.”
This is the thought (expressed in a very unsatisfied way) by Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that first was by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been a quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened well and we will evaluate for the future.
But we also talk about the whistles of Mameli’s anthem: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me I am not education.
Students victims of the dear-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rents market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenant's union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of the Sunia Studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market that it triggered a process of generalized increase even for residents".
In most cases, rent offers then contain a series of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without fee limit, related sub-rents.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the review of taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room ranging from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are asked for for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples for a bed it takes 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
Bari for a bed it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee requested from foreign students than that applied to Italians is more frequent.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great multiplexes and the consequent death by consummation of the monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear inevitable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and full of memory "it is as if a friend comes to pass away, an acquaintance with whom we have shared a piece of the street and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar winner and the Grand Jury Prize of Cannes, and which told the poetry of a provincial room and nostalgia for a way of living the cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and to pay the greatest price are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna excels with 82 single-room cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures are built but it should be guaranteed the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failure to allocate the fund in favor of the merchants: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about closures, has decided to run for cover with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules provided for there are tax relief measures in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counteract the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by the dust I turn on the other side.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli cosca".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria are heavy for the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of association for mafia-style delinquency, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized crime there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'Ndrangheta, heroes who keep clean.
This morning's arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cosca.
Since the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected to head a center-right coalition, after the runoff in May 2006.
He cried out to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having concocted everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli cosca had even come to ask for the change of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the prosecutors wrote, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When energy comes from the waves now the big ones take to the field
It is an endless field, which occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now discovering it the world’s big energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have set their eyes, and now they try to get their hands on, giants like the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist instances and the new increase in oil boosts the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore seas operating facilities.
This amount would be twice as much as the nuclear power plant currently produced.
And in addition there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossi to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years later, betting on marine energy is increasingly and among these companies always devoted to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the U.S. oil giant told the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us,” the statement said.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit from the US Energy Commission, necessary to launch a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a significant signal, especially considering that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate according to observers an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, facilities such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
However, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used to produce large-scale energy.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down is converted to hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type being designed, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power already produces power for a shopping mall and parking using six underwater turbines in the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are tides makes the turbine blades spin, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of the tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that border the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and planned investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
