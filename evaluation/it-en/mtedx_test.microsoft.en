[Roberto Battiston] Daring, having the courage to go into space.
Space is an object of fascination, dream, danger.
What you see is a small solar phenomenon that happened a few years ago: a small spot emitted a large burst of particles, plasma, and sun-spot 1,692, exactly as big as Earth.
What happened in the hours, in the following days: a huge mass of particles, plasma, energy, two days later arrived on Earth and what happened illuminated the skies of Northern Europe with formidable aurora borealis, never seen.
But only this has happened, because the Earth is protected from phenomena around space, a hostile space, by at least three elements: the magnetic field that deflects particles, our planet that partially shields us and the atmosphere, which is like having two and a half meters of aluminum in front of us that protect us from particles.
But if we were on a journey to Mars, if we did what we wanted to do for so many years since von Brown, conquer the Red Planet with astronauts, what would protect us?
How could we manage to withstand this and all the other challenges that space offers us?
The space we conquered: this is the International Space Station, the size of a football field, it can accommodate up to nine astronauts.
It is the technological jewel of modern times.
It's something absolutely fantastic.
Samantha Cristoforetti, Luca Parmitano: our astronauts have been hosted for months in this great space hotel where they managed to resist the hostility of space.
But during the mission, something unpredictable happened to Luca Parmitano: a small pump that managed the cooling of the spacesuit with which Parmitano was walking in space, working outside the Space Station, broke.
He began to lose liquid: half a glass of water but he began to float in the helmet, sucked in from the nose and mouth.
He was about to drown in a glass of water in space.
Who would have imagined that?
Nobody.
It was going to happen.
He was saved because the other companions quickly brought him inside the inhabited space and he was able to get rid of this half glass of water in which he was drowning.
What is it that we are missing?
We lack materials that can repair themselves, systems that can protect themselves automatically.
Where can we look for this kind of new technology?
[Nicholas Pugno] Nature is, of course, capable of self-repair.
We see it every day: when we scratch ourselves thank goodness, we can therefore repair ourselves.
Even recently, since the 2,000s, from an engineering point of view, we can mimic this feature a little.
The concept is very simple: you can also imagine it by referring to this projection.
Imagine putting capsules inside a traditional material.
These capsules, in turn, contain a sort of glue, so to speak, on microcapsules, there are many widespread almost everywhere.
When the crack propagates and tends to split my structure also splits the capsules that release this liquid that goes to mend the crack and therefore, in essence, we have a material that has repaired itself.
It is something that already exists.
There are even paints that can self-repair, so if they are scratched they stitch up on their own.
[Robert] A very useful technology!
This is part of a more general framework in which we imitate nature.
[Nicholas] Well, of course!
Imitating nature has always been done.
Think also of Leonardo's studies, also with regard to flight.
Observing the flight of birds we tried to build the first machines to go flying.
Inspiration is certainly important, rather than mimicking nature tout-court.
Airplanes do not, for example, flap their wings, but we have achieved remarkable results that we use, alas, every day.
[Robert] Very well, then, at this point, it will mean that the next time we have to repair a piece of the Space Station, let's look, in this case, at a panel that was unfolded, almost 80 meters long, at a certain point showed a crack and the astronaut had to sew and stitch, repair with enormous effort and risk.
We would need more resistant materials that do not break, that can withstand the hostility of space, folding, opening.
[Nicholas] Well, certainly one possibility is to self-repair, another is that they do not split.
So, to take inspiration, the most tenacious material, which has the greatest ability to dissipate energy before going to break, is spider silk.
Spiders are exceptional: think that even any spider you find around is able to make up to seven different types of silks.
Here you see the silk spinning apparatus.
It can therefore produce materials that are either extremely resistant or extremely tenacious, or able to dissipate even more energy with structural solutions that we will then see and are also sticky to block prey.
They can do some really amazing things.
To give you an idea, this material is ten times more tenacious than Kevlar.
Here you see a junction at the web itself, you have an additional length of silk inside a droplet and this further increases the ability to dissipate energy of the web, of the structure.
In this way an insect is blocked and so the spider has been able to evolve and survive to this day.
[Robert] The spider's web is something extraordinary.
There are very special materials in space.
For example, a helicopter on Mars would need, due to the very reduced atmosphere compared to the Earth's atmosphere, blades that spin much faster, that are much larger and lighter.
Today we do not know how to make them: even the most resistant materials such as carbon fiber struggle to withstand these very special stresses.
[Nicholas] Yes, carbon is actually the fiber we know today, from an engineering point of view, macroscopic at least, the most resistant ever.
Six GigaPascals: six times the strength of steel.
Theoretically there is a material that is even more resistant, at least from an ideal point of view, and it is a single layer of carbon atoms: the famous, so to speak, graphene.
Several layers of this graphene then make the graphite that we have in our pencils, not resistant because the planes flow between them, but the single sheet of graphite is extremely resistant.
A strength of 100 times steel, at least theoretically.
In this way we can certainly make the blades of a helicopter to go to Mars and it could also have application on Earth.
Many people could not be rescued in Nepal, because we did not have helicopters to go below a certain altitude.
But we can also do even more extravagant things such as, for example, a space elevator cable to be able to bring mass from Mars to space at a very low cost with advantages that we know well because we use elevators.
[Robert] But if we want, beyond a single very resistant layer, to have complex structural materials that we need for a whole series of applications, what has nature done in this sector?
[Nicholas] So this is very important.
We use carbon fibers in materials from other matrices to build composite materials.
When we mix things, unfortunately, for defects and many other things, resistance breaks down.
Indeed, carbon-based composites today are not so durable.
But there are natural composites.
Recently we observed the composite, the biological material with the greatest strength and found it in the nails of the limpets.
Going to take these elements, trying the tractions, we saw a mechanical resistance of six GigaPascals, that is much greater than the composites that man is able to make today.
[Robert] Exceptional, we are truly gathering a truly extraordinary amount of input and suggestions from nature.
Well, one of the problems that we have in space, both in low orbits and traveling deep, are what are called space debris, micrometeorites.
They move so fast at 7, 8, 10 kilometers per second that even a very small object - here we have the example of a centimeter of a metal ball - slamming against 18 centimeters thick of aluminum has practically pierced it, has deformed it for the enormous energy that has dissipated with a way that material as such could not absorb.
We would need screens, much more resistant protections.
What can we look towards nature in this sense?
[Nicholas] Think of insects.
Nature has evolved absolutely in this context.
Insect armor is an example.
Here we see in particular a very interesting beetle, the so-called bomber beetle, which manages to emit this fluid at high temperature and high pressure to get rid of its enemies.
That's why, you may have noticed, I was scared before when the drummer emitted these streams, they reminded a bit of this thing that we observe here.
The beetle has this remarkable peculiarity, because imagine the material that makes up the internal combustion chamber.
You see, it has this very light structure but it also has this wavy surface and this wavy surface seems to be the key to further resisting explosions, as in this case, but also impacts.
In fact, doing simulations, - you see a diagram of a numerical simulation at the bottom right - we observed that, at par of mass, at par of average thickness of this plate, if wavy with a certain ripple, the protective capacity becomes much greater.
One might think, one day, to make screens for spaceships to Mars inspired by the bomber beetle.
[Robert] Exceptional, but another problem we have in space is that we need very large structures and when we leave with our missiles by definition they can only be folded.
A difficulty for space engineering is to be able to open them, possibly to close them, reliably, taking advantage of lightness, when we are in space, and flexibility and folding when we are still leaving for Earth.
It's one of the hardest things to make sure the mechanics develop and work back in place as much as we want.
From this point of view, what can nature tell us?
[Nicholas] Nature can tell us, as always, a lot.
You see a very simple ladybug.
'Very simple' so to speak, 'very common', I would say.
The ladybug can spread the wings without any problem, manages to fold them.
Imagine the complexity It bends them thanks to a system of ribs on the wings, which are also structural for the wings, but which, with a sort of elastic stability, so to speak, manages to open and close these wings in a somewhat discontinuous way, therefore in a very controlled way.
So we could imagine doing something similar to control very well the opening and closing of these panels.
[Robert] This is precisely the technology of the third millennium: we need to make an absolutely extraordinary leap to go and do something that nature has already learned and is able to do for billions of years.
We went to Mars, we landed: we need resources.
The first resource that the astronaut needs is water.
We know that on Mars there is water, frozen, under the various layers of the ground, but that there is also an atmosphere.
So there must be some amount of water in the Martian atmosphere.
If we could recover water from the atmosphere as we do on Earth it would be extremely useful.
What could we do, taking inspiration from nature?
[Nicholas] There are organisms that can do this.
Think for example of the cactus.
Here I would like to give a different example: it is another beetle, the Namibian beetle, a desert beetle, which has a surface that is composed of two hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.
That is, materials that, on the one hand, are able to attract water and, on the other, absolutely manage to make it flow very well.
This combination of two types of surfaces within the same macroscopic surface means that it is able to recover a lot of water and therefore manages to survive in desert environments.
[Robert] Fabulous: beetles that take water from the air.
But, speaking of surfaces, we would need self-cleaning surfaces.
For example, this is one of the rovers on the Martian surface.
After a few months, it became covered with dust: the solar panels, which we see on the left, are completely unusable.
Fortunately, every now and then, beyond the storms there are lighter winds, small whirlwinds that clean up and, fortunately, put it back in place as on the right.
But if we had surfaces that are intrinsically self-cleaning, that can eliminate any form of deposit, we would certainly be even better prepared to face an interplanetary journey.
[Nicholas] Self-cleaning surfaces in nature certainly exist; The most famous is the lotus leaf, so much so that we talk about the lotus effect.
Here you see some droplets of water flowing on this surface.
It gives you a very clear idea of how this is water repellent, super hydrophobic, in this sense, and it is a particular surface, so much so that it is considered sacred by some populations, because, despite living in swamps, in dirty places, it can always be very clean.
This is basically thanks to a surface topology invisible to the naked eye, but which is very well highlighted under the microscope.
A particular topology thanks to which, basically, the material becomes recently hydrophobic to super hydrophobic, from a chemical point of view.
It is therefore clear that, by mimicking this topology, which today can be done with nanotechnology, we can substantially change the properties of 'wetability' - that is, interaction with water - of surfaces.
Here you see for example a plastic surface inspired by the lotus leaf that we made, simply with this topology visible to the naked eye, the interaction with the fluid changes dramatically.
[Robert] Exceptional!
One of the things we have seen, an imitation of nature is the famous Velcro.
You remember, it was patented and studied because someone started wondering why socks, going to the fields, attach a certain type of seeds of some plants.
Velcro in space is used everywhere to attach and close.
Even the suits that go to the moon have pieces of Velcro to be able to quickly make closures.
But nature has done much more on this, hasn't it?
[Nicholas] Velcro is extremely interesting.
The main problem with Velcro is that you can stick one element on the other, that is, I can hook the hooks to the microrings that are there.
In nature, clearly, there was a need for something much more sophisticated.
The most sophisticated animal ever, from this point of view, because the largest, has necessarily had to evolve with the best adhesive mechanisms ever: it is the gecko, which actually has, inside its paw, a number, we have also counted them, billions of elements in grip, of two-dimensional structures, each of which exercises a small chest that added together make a remarkable adhesive resistance of the gecko.
Just to give you an idea, it resists five times an ideal suction cup.
He also manages to control this adhesion; This is perhaps the most intriguing aspect.
He manages to detach himself very easily, using a little bit the concept that we use when we regulate when we want not to hurt ourselves by removing a plaster, that is, changing the angle in which he removes the hair from the surface.
You could think of gecko-inspired surfaces to move a little where we want.
[Robert] We must also explain this to the spider-man who perhaps has to become man-gecko to go into space.
Well, there is still a problem of duration and exposure to radiation and the difficulties of deep vacuum in heat and cold and also on this nature has given us extraordinary indications.
Both brewer's yeast, lichens, streptococci, and some complex structures such as plankton, and tardigrades, very small, but still complex animals, were put into space, exposed to radiation, vacuum, temperature change, went into a form of hibernation and then were awakened after 10, 15,  20 months, finding that some of these individuals are still alive.
It's amazing what nature has done, because it has never been exposed to these conditions, but nevertheless, some of these animals on Earth have had the chance to develop these characteristics.
But there is an absolutely impossible challenge to overcome: the duration of a space trip!
Mars 6.8 months, but the first star 100,000 years with current launch and travel techniques.
How can we think of facing such a long journey?
[Nicholas] Well, here we can also hope to take inspiration but the challenge is very strong.
But it is to be mentioned that it is the only organism that is known to be immortal.
A jellyfish that is so called, immortal jellyfish, which even has the ability to rejuvenate, that is, return to the state of polyp in particularly adverse conditions.
So basically it is as if a man in extreme conditions decided to return as a child and then replay his life when the extreme conditions, too adverse, had appeared.
It is certainly a very interesting peculiarity and also difficult to mimic.
[Robert] Now I understand why some science fiction movies show octopones arriving with spaceships evidently they are already aware of this possibility.
In any case, it is clear that interplanetary travel, possibly tomorrow when we will have more effective ways to move, the interstellar one, requires very different technologies to which we are not accustomed and that nature, as you have seen, could give us very interesting stimuli and challenges.
We will probably need new technologies tomorrow.
That is why the challenge of going to Mars is so interesting to improve the set of man's technical capabilities.
[Nicholas] We can't end like this: when will we go to Mars?
[Robert] Ah, I don't know, but I'm sure that the man and woman who will go there have already been born.
Thank you.
[Applause]
I work in the digital economy in Europe and Italy, and I was lucky enough to spend part of my career in companies that were headquartered in California.
I have been active for several years as an angel investor.
For me, 2017 was a year with some satisfaction for my work: I received two awards for my business angel activity, one in Italy and one in Europe; In the past two years I have been among the "inspiring 50", the 50 most inspiring women in the world of technology in Europe.
I should be over the moon.
But they are not.
For me, 2017 has been, so far, a year of defeat for women in the tech world.
Defeats that hurt us, because they come from the same place from which innovation and the future come; A place that is taken as a model and a place where everything that happens has an echo that spreads all over the world.
I'm talking about Silicon Valley.
In 2017, episodes and behaviors began to come to light that are disconcerting both in themselves and for the silence with which they were previously hidden.
In February 2017 Susan Fowler, recounting her experience as a developer object of unwanted sexual attention and rejected in a team of Uber engineers, sets in motion a chain of events that on June 20 leads to the resignation of the CEO, Travis Kalanick.
On June 13, at an internal meeting at Uber, entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, who serves on the company's board, talks about her desire to co-opt more women to the board.
David Bonderman, her colleague, interrupts her with a sexist joke: "More women, more talk," she says.
The reaction leads Bonderman to have to resign from his position on the board of Uber.
On June 30, the New York Times published a report in which more than two dozen aspiring female entrepreneurs, including Rachel Renock, reported sexism during their interactions with venture capital funds they proposed to invest in their companies.
In July, Dave McClure, founder of the incubator "500 startups", resigned after admitting improper behavior towards female entrepreneurs seeking funding, collaborators and candidates.
Including Sara Kunst, who had told her story to the New York Times.
In August, an internal memo written by a Google employee, James Damore, appeared in public, criticizing the company's diversity initiatives by claiming that women are biologically unfit to do the job of programmer.
On August 7, Google terminated its employment relationship with him; quickly, he became the spokesman for a misogynistic and alt-right current of thought in Silicon Valley.
In past years, wonderful things have come from California: cultural exports such as James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, the Beach Boys, the beat generation, hippie culture, the Black Panthers, California punk music, Ronald Reagan, Blade Runner, the Mac, Indiana Jones, the iPhone.
This year we only got the poison between men and women.
So much poison.
I will now take a step back to the early 90s.
At that time, as a recent graduate, I started my career in a multinational strategic consulting company in Milan.
I didn't have many female role models, indeed we can say that I had only one: this is Marisa Bellisario, graduated in economics in the early 90s.
She worked as a programmer on the first Olivetti mainframes, then made a commercial career in Olivetti, in General Electric.
In 1981 she became CEO of Italtel: a huge company in deep crisis of which, in a few years, she completed the turn around.
He conquers the covers of world magazines, stands out for hairstyles, clothing, it is known that he would have achieved further career goals if it had not been for the veto placed by some men of power.
In 1988 he died at the age of 53 from bone cancer.
So I started my career with only one role model of female manager.
And she wasn't even alive anymore, she was already dead.
Some time ago I was curious to go and see what the people who started their career with me in that same place, in that same year, are doing today.
Men are CEOs, more than half; general manager; managing director; senior partner; managing partner; Chief Strategy Officer.
Women, no.
Women do, with some important and luminous exceptions, other things.
They took other paths.
I have taken my road: I work as an independent director and as a business angel, as I told you.
I have held, in my career, roles of responsibility, I have had many satisfactions.
Today I am an independent, a freelancer: I am invited to speak in public on the issues of digital economy, startups, innovation; and even to testify about the success of professional women managers, and to talk about my work, in particular, in Italy and abroad.
But I don't have a top chair.
I have, yes, important responsibilities: but I do not exercise any power, if not shared and collegial within the councils of which I am a member.
I am an independent, a freelancer.
And so did most of my colleagues along the way.
So what happened to my generation of women?
What has prevented them from achieving the career goals they set themselves in the early 90s, and what can we do so that what happened to us, whatever it is, does not happen to those who come after us?
So that other women can achieve their goals without crashing into a wall?
And what are the costs of this state of affairs?
It is well known that the world economy, the well-being of all of us, pays a cost in terms of lack of growth for the absence of women from decision-making processes from the world of work; According to the OECD, we are losing two and a half points of growth over the next eight years due to the participation gap.
If we halved it, the world would grow more.
In companies, the lack of diversity in management, correlated with a lower degree of innovation than that found in companies where at least 20% of top managers are women.
But these economic arguments are known and strange, and do not push for change.
Instead, I would like to give you some data on the human costs of the situation in which we find ourselves, and these costs concern not only women but also men, these men to whom, in the vast majority of cases, we entrust the roles of power in companies, while we entrust other tasks to women.
We have concrete evidence, for example, of how decoupling masculinity from the role of breadwinner, or income procurer, could have important benefits for women and men.
An American study shows us that if the incomes in the couple diverge, over time, in favor of the man, the physical and psychological health of the man is more likely to deteriorate: anxiety and depression increase.
And the effect is even stronger if the man remains the only one of the two to bring income.
A longitudinal study of 72,000 Swedish men showed that decades after the birth of a child, men who took parental leave for a period of one or two months survived more than their colleagues who did not, at the same age, education, employment level.
The mortality rate of men who cared for their young children was 24 percent lower than that of those who did not.
The experience of caring for newborns seems to have, in fathers, an effect of prevention of risky behaviors, in particular alcoholism; And it's an effect that will last for decades to come.
So what promotes equality at work and at home?
Equal economic opportunities and care tasks?
Unfortunately there is no silver bullet, we can only make some considerations.
A study of 6,000 Danish companies with a male CEO showed that when the boss has a firstborn daughter, the pay gap in the company decreases because women's wages rise faster than men's.
This does not occur if the firstborn is a son.
A US study suggests that venture capital funds whose partners have daughters hire more women.
[And] not only do they hire more women, they also perform better.
It is clear that requiring those who exercise power in companies to have daughters is unfortunately not a lever of policy that can unfortunately be implemented; We cannot force top managers to reproduce or spawn these strange beings of a different sex than their own.
Perhaps as a suggestion to girls at their first job, before sending that resume it is worth taking a look at the family composition of those who sit in the room of buttons.
What does all this mean?
That gender stereotypes, which exist and are there for all to see, do not only hurt women.
The stereotypes are cages: a slightly wider and more comfortable and comfortable cage for men, a narrower and more limiting cage for women and an even narrower one for transgender, intersex and binary people.
So stereotypes really hurt everyone.
It hurts us women who accept to be seen as the queens of multitasking and to leave much of the power, too, to men.
As a result, we still suffer a wage gap, we have less career, we accumulate less wealth and less savings, we are less autonomous.
And the prejudice against us seems to be as alive in the millennial generation as it is in that of their parents.
But stereotypes also hurt men, because masculinity can become a trap.
From childhood we socialize males as incomplete children who can express a limited range of emotions.
If a little girl wants to play football, or loves cars, by now we understand that it's fine, let's let her be a bit of a tomboy.
But if a child loves ballet, we still treat him like Billy Elliot in the 80s.
So let's raise these male children in their cage of masculinity stereotypes.
We send them to school, then they go to work and we expect them to be the economic engine of the family.
With their baggage of stereotypes, and with ours.
When a woman leaves her job outside the home to devote herself to her children, which tragically happens much more than she should, she has all our solidarity.
We say: look at what a good mother, look at what heroine, what sacrifices she made to raise her children.
In the few cases in which, instead, it is a man who makes this decision, staying at home with the children, perhaps because the woman earns better than him, we punish him by perceiving him as weak and inadequate.
This double standard is very dangerous.
The stereotype hurts everyone: women, men and society as a whole.
My feeling is that elsewhere women are moving a little faster than here in the West.
For example, in China, leaving the stereotype, 55 percent of digital startups are founded by women.
How many are there here?
And women in China are partners in 80% of venture capital funds.
They decide in which initiative to invest.
They are marching, moving, moving forward: we here, in the West, have the feeling of standing still, or almost millimetrically advancing and, occasionally, going back.
Because even in very innovative environments, where the future is produced, it is as if women and men in the world of work were separated by a large canyon.
And from this canyon came the summer of poisons, of which I told you a moment ago.
There is an air of defeat, there is a lot of bitterness for having tried to win without having taken into account that the dice were rigged.
It is enough to make me want to renounce dialogue, to return among likes, to close ourselves up among those who understand us, to cut bridges.
But I am convinced that, more than ever, it is time to build bridges: to build bridges between women and men to be able to meet halfway and shake hands.
Make an effort together: now is the time to challenge the canyon that divides women and men.
What does this mean in practice?
I would not like to repeat to you the recipes already known, such as the need for companies to activate a different organization of work; Or like the voluntary effort of Let's Go Forward, of the lean-in, which is largely always borne by women.
Today I have three new recipes for you that all have to do with building bridges: a personal, a media and a political.
The first is personal: hygiene, in the workplace, is your responsibility.
I speak of behavioral hygiene: if you are a man, you must know that at work, every day, a thousand things happen: interruptions, jokes, comments, words said in a half-voice, ideas generated by one person and attributed to another, which to a woman make the effect of a thousand cuts in the skin made with the edge of a sheet of paper.
And of which you men, often, do not even notice.
Sit down with a woman and ask her, if and when it happens, to let you know, discreetly but effectively, as it happens.
With a gesture, with a glance, with a signal agreed in advance.
Then take aside the men who interrupted, teased, excluded or belittled a woman and explain to them that this is no longer acceptable in 2017.
If you are a woman, however, do not unnecessarily exhaust your energy by keeping your frustration inside, or trying to explain these things yourself.
Find a man ally, build a bridge with him, and make him work on it.
The second recipe is the media one: look with a critical eye at the role messages that surround us.
Your children's school textbooks are full of stereotypes, even today, in 2017.
Dad and mom, look at these texts.
Not just moms.
Talk to teachers about it and have texts adopted that are more appropriate to the times in which we live.
Television, advertising, are always part of the media environment that surrounds us.
And we are not just talking about the classic object woman, who must disappear from our screens without ifs and buts.
We are talking about those cages made of stereotypes that in 2018 will have to stop existing in the United Kingdom because the Authority for Standards in the world of Advertising has decided to put into force new anti-stereotype guidelines.
For example, advertisements in which the whole family makes a mess and only the mother puts it back in order can be sanctioned; those in which a typical activity of girls is presented as not suitable for boys, or vice versa; those in which a man is teased because he tries unnecessarily, and without success, to perform tasks of care of the house or family.
Do we also want advertising without these stereotypes?
Well, let's make our voices heard, women and men.
This includes creators in agencies, ad campaign clients, decision makers within companies, and all of us consumers.
The third recipe is the political one: there is a great taboo that we must eradicate in Italy and that is that parental leave should be reserved for women.
True, every time you try to give men an extra day of 100% paid paternity leave, the public coffers cry; But habits do not change by giving days with the dropper.
Habits are changing all over the world: in companies like Facebook, which offers all its employees, when they become fathers, up to 4 months of paternity leave; or Spotify, which offers 6.
But outside of the large, successful companies that can afford to have these equal policies, what can we do?
We have a great resource in Italy: after compulsory leave, optional parental leave: today it is six months, only partially paid and available only to the mother.
It is politically possible, if we make an alliance between men and women, to institute optional bipartisan leave: three months for one parent, three months for the other, without being able to be exchanged or transferred.
In this way, women would return to work sooner, which is a great benefit; Fathers would find themselves learning care work and perhaps, like the Swedes, living longer; And third, the whole of society would function better.
In an ideal world, men and women with a new baby would be home for the same time.
No one in the company would ever be denied an assignment, a project, a promotion, a salary increase because they could have a child.
We can no longer afford, men and women, not to be feminists.
Building bridges is the only way to unravel the world we live in.
With the three recipes I told you about today, we could go a long way.
That is why I leave you with the words of a man who speaks as a feminist.
Thank you.
(Applause) [English: It is crucial that everyone understands] [that men not only can,] [But they should be feminists.]
[And I'm proud of it] [Being a feminist, for me, means acknowledging] [that men and women should, can, must have equal rights.]
[And second, that there is still an enormity of work to be done.]
[He for She is a movement promoted by the United Nations,] [to which I hope you all join,] [of men in defense of women.]
[Of men who nip those offensive conversations in the bud] [born in locker rooms, and in a culture of camaraderie].
[We need to know we can be better than this!]
[The way we treat our sisters, girlfriends,] [cousins, mothers, and the world around us,] [counts!]
[We must rediscover the true meaning of manhood] [which is openness, respect, compassion] [and the courage to defend all this!]
(Applause)
Holy Father, I started writing to you two years ago.
An advanced spring morning, in a village in the Langhe, with cobblestone streets spiraling up to the square.
On the square a castle and an ancient church as there are many, in Piedmont.
From that square, the valley opens at breakneck speed, at the bottom, the hills covered with woods: chestnut and hazelnut trees, below, the vineyards and cornfields.
The beauty of the Langhe, there the extraordinary beauty of the landscape coexists with the horror of certain families, mine: bourgeois, in the indifference of many.
Holy Father, my name is Ginevra, I am 40 years old, I am originally from Turin, I grew up there and I attended high school.
After I met the man who would become my husband, it was autumn.
He came from the Langhe, Cuneo, a slender young man, with beautiful manners.
He had just enrolled in Medicine in Turin, Corso Massimo d'Azeglio.
That day the mists of the Po rose in the park, the air got us drunk, we looked at each other and we were happy.
A dream remained in the blood.
He graduated, specialized, married, a lavish marriage.
I moved to his country.
First son: Matthew, gift of God.
Then Peter and Luke, the twins.
Peter is the stone on which Jesus founds his Church, Luke is the light, Our Lady's favorite, St. Luke is the patron saint of doctors.
Franscesca: green eyes and blond curls, elusive gardo ... It looks like me.
My children are beautiful.
They have that healthy complexion of those who live in the countryside.
At the foot of the Langhe, at the confluence of two rivers, 300 meters above sea level.
Once upon a time, a stop for travelers and pilgrims on the ancient salt road that connected Albenga to Alba.
We live in a large farmhouse, during the day, the children play barefoot in the grass and jump for joy, at night the crickets sing.
Andrea is the heir of a rich family, owners of a palace in the city and a beautiful villa by the sea in San Remo.
His family is known in our village, he makes many donations to the church, and on Sundays he always shows up at Mass in the wooden bench in the front row with the family name written on it.
As a young man he took the time to travel, but instead of marrying a village girl, a girl accustomed to country life, he chose me.
Torinese, a foreigner in Cuneo, slender and blonde like some others she had met in the world.
Unfortunately, our beautiful story ends here.
My husband does not have the moral virtues of King Arthur, when he returned to live in the country he changed.
It will be the peasant culture, sexist, they will be the friends at the bar, for them women do not count, they are made to serve them.
The fact is that Andrea has become violent and has been beating me for twelve years, now he also uses violence on children.
In the surroundings there is no Lancelot able to save us, ours is not a degraded situation, like certain suburbs: far from it.
Andrea is primary, he earns well.
Of course, he is not generous with me: he gives me a few euros at a time, in the evening he claims the grocer's receipts, he passes by the butcher at the end of the month, but, after all, the money is there.
The other night Andrea kicked me, I was too tired, I couldn't resist the pain, I screamed.
The little girl woke up startled and crept up the stairs and saw me on the ground while her father hit me.
The next morning, at school, she burst into tears, the teacher hugged her, she was told everything, she was surprised: she has always known Andrea.
She never expected it to be violent.
But children don't tell lies.
The teacher summoned me, she said she would talk to him.
I begged her not to, we risk being killed, me and the child.
For now, I don't feel like rebelling, I can't leave this beautiful house, to move with my four children to a small apartment.
And then my husband is Catholic, he doesn't want to separate.
My parents are also Catholic, practicing.
They live in the city, I don't see them often.
My mother sensed something, but I don't want to sadden her with my problems, I already know that she wouldn't like a divorced daughter.
Actually I don't want to leave Andrea, I don't want to go to the Carabinieri, as a friend recommends, a high school friend, the only one I hear from time to time.
It would be like betraying him.
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, it all seems so strange to me.
When I met him, Andrea was kind, he is even now: he beats me, then hugs me, says he loves me.
It happens often.
If I bleed, obviously he does the dressing, he doesn't want to go to the emergency room, everyone knows him there.
Often the family, instead of being the image of love, becomes a place of quiet cruelty.
The other day I came home, I found myself in front of Andrea's mother as a young man was manesque, beating her husband, children, at home she does not speak Italian, she uses dialect.
In that rough language, a few nights ago he incited Andrea to beat me.
Then it was she, my mother-in-law, who sent me away, away from home, the children watched, astonished.
Maybe it's because here oxen and people are all a race, I'm from Turin, I'm from a good, bourgeois family.
She would have preferred a girl here, one of those who stay at home and say nothing.
On Sunday I went to confession, Don Paolo says that I must have patience, endure.
People tried by the greatest suffering are God's favorite, Jesus said.
I don't have to complain, the family is sacred, it cannot be dismembered.
Of course it is difficult to remain united, if we are not all respectful of each other, but here at stake there is not only respect, there is violence, violence severs love.
After beating me, Andrea goes to confession, repents and the priest grants him forgiveness.
Then he falls back on it, goes back to beating me and Don Paolo forgives him again.
He is a country priest, my mother-in-law brings him chickens and rabbits, stories of other times.
Andrea means "man".
Holy Father, in the Mass at the beginning of your Pontificate you said that every person must be the guardian of himself and of others.
Andrea was watching Mass, on TV, then a pretext was enough for him to beat me again, in front of the children: it became normal, even for me.
I remain silent, staring at my man distraughtly.
I had four children, but here women are like then: they make children, and they count for nothing.
I am full of bruises, I hide the wound on my cheekbone with a little makeup I have to do something for them, for my children, the eldest has started to raise his hands.
Holy Father, I heard you on the radio, while you were talking about the first believers, I would like to ask you for help.
Perhaps one of his words would be enough to put an end to so much violence, violence disguised as love, I have heard.
But perhaps it would not help.
What can be said that has not already been said?
Unless you, Holy Father, decide to speak to priests, to those like Don Paolo, so that they do not so easily grant forgiveness to men like my husband.
May the Church forgive, where she feels sincere repentance because a merely formal repentance serves to return to the sacraments but also to the usual violence.
You have to show repentance, try to correct yourself.
In the face of fiction the priest cannot, and must not absolve.
Holy Father, I already wrote to you a couple of years ago but you had just ascended to the papal throne, it was the wrong time.
You already know, my name is Ginevra, I am Piedmontese like your grandfather Giovanni and your great-grandfather Francesco.
I live in Turin, beautiful, ancient, when in the evening it becomes a star in front of a large choir of people.
Turin means Naples that goes to the mountains, Turin: straight roads, it is the other side of Rome itself, Turin, a city sick of melancholy, so Venditti sings it.
We live in a condominium in Corso Francia, a straight road: it starts from Piazza Statuto, Porta Susa and leads to France, to Chambéry.
Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy had wanted it in 1711, it connected the Royal Palace with the residence of Rivoli.
During the Second World War, when Italy entered the war against France, the city authorities changed the name, in Corso Gabriele D'Annunzio.
After the war it returns to be Corso Francia Today the subway passes underneath: nine stops.
At the beginning of Corso Francia there are many beautiful villas, Liberty style, early twentieth century.
We live a little further, towards Rivoli, a suburb of Turin.
In my apartment building live the employees.
Early in the morning they run to work.
The one where I live is not my home.
It's the house where I grew up, my parents'.
They are elderly, they left me their furnished apartment and moved to the countryside.
Now, let us tell you how I found the courage to go to the Carabinieri and denounce Andrea.
There and then I didn't want to.
Francesca was in fourth grade when her father kicked me on the carpet.
The next morning, she told the teacher everything.
Worried, the teacher wanted to go to Andrea, to talk to him.
It was not good for the child to tell those things around.
I begged her not to say anything, she would beat us to death, me and the child.
I had made my decision.
For Francesca.
Today he is in sixth grade.
After talking to the teacher I went to the Carabinieri and the Emergency Room.
They ascertained the bruises, it had not been the worst time, I had been beaten much worse.
But it was enough to file a complaint.
A few weeks later I went to a law firm, in Turin I entrusted myself to a lawyer for the criminal case, to another for the civil case.
I did not ask for state patronage, I wanted a trusted person.
I spent everything I had on lawyers.
A huge sacrifice.
Now Andrea gives me 500 euros a month for each of our children.
He should have given me more, he is rich, but the properties are registered to his mother.
He doesn't care if his children don't have the same opportunities as before.
He doesn't care about the sacrifices I make to pay for the English course, violin.
The boys have changed their lives, they give up many things, they attend public school, yet they do not complain.
They never said they wanted to go back to the country, to their father.
They do not regret that old farmhouse, with vaulted ceilings, frescoes, the terrace, those beautiful arches.
I work part-time, secretary, in a museum, 900 euros a month.
In short, the expenses are many, even if I pay only 500 euros of rent, a symbolic figure, they are retired teachers, some health problems, they get by, but I can not expect more.
They already do a lot, and in any case they do not have great availability.
They are Catholics, practicing, and after many reservations they finally accepted that I left my husband and asked for separation.
And to think that two years ago they told me to be patient, turn the other cheek.
My brothers, on the other hand, just can't accept my choice.
They live outside Turin, I rarely see them.
I know that the time available to me is about to end, Holy Father, Let me tell you the reactions of Andrea and his family: when I left there was very bad.
Now she plays the part of the betrayed gentleman in honor, and I pass for crazy.
The week is in a white coat at the Emergency Room, on Saturdays volunteers at the Green Cross and occasionally with the elderly.
Sunday in church.
I am the one who invented everything.
He sued me.
Five open cases in court.
To have taken it worse is my mother-in-law: a proud, wounded in pride, thought that silence would protect everyone.
For her I am a witch, to be sent to an asylum: she does not understand how she could raise her head, give up my life as a lady to live in an unrenovated suburban apartment.
I just gave the white, everything was kept.
Few clothes, I didn't have any jewels, he never gave me any.
The turn of pearls?
Gift of my mother for eighteen years, in Piedmont uses so.
I never came back to the village, it's Andrea's territory.
I can't even go into that house to get my things I left in a hurry, two years ago, it was June, school was about to end, I did just in time to collect the report cards.
One evening Andrea was on call in the hospital.
I took the children and we left, in Turin, 80km on the old car that Andrea had returned, a few months later through lawyers.
We left no friends in the village, neither me nor the boys: they were isolated, the father never wanted anyone at home.
It wasn't easy but I did it, we did it.
Holy Father, I'm not asking you anything, I just wanted to tell you how it went, that's all.
In church?
I go there, every Sunday, I bring my children They were used to that beautiful ancient church: after Mass, while the bells rang in celebration, we went out on the square, looking out over the Langhe.
Now let's go to the neighborhood parish, in Corso Francia.
It's not the same thing, but that's okay.
I spoke about these events of mine with a priest, I met him by chance, on the train he left a mark.
His name was Father Carlo Caroglio, he said that we must not suffer violence he was a city priest, modern, originally from Alessandria, he had lived for a long time in Novara, before becoming a priest he had studied as a chemical expert, as you did.
Don Carlo was different from the priest of the village, the one who still says to Andrea: "You should not feel guilty if your wife has left you, a wife who abandons you does not love you, it is she who should be ashamed, she is not worthy of you."
Andrea beat me, then went to the priest, said he was repentant, and the priest absolved him.
For this reason, Andrea feels on the right side.
Your Holiness I have nothing more to tell you, there is no more time.
I trust in your goodness and understanding.
I ask you only one thing: make sure that priests do not always absolve violent men.
Best regards, Ginevra
(Applause)
I'm going to tell you a story.
A few weeks ago, I accompanied my daughter, 10 years old, named Ilaria, to school.
But I wasn't dressed like that, so I didn't have a shirt and jacket.
My daughter, with the curiosity typical of 10-year-old girls, tells me: popes, you don't go to work today.
I ask her: no, today I actually work from home.
She looks at me and says, well, you probably won't have anything important to do.
(Laughter) And this thing made me think a little.
It made me think how much we ourselves actually contribute to creating prejudices in our children.
Because I will tell you that, in reality, according to my way of seeing, work is not a place where you go.
Work is changing, it is changing profoundly.
I'm going to tell you some things that support my thesis.
It is changing because there are increasingly rare skills, but increasingly required by the market and companies.
A BCG study has certified that about 30 percent of high-tech positions will be vacant in the next 18 to 24 months due to lack of skills.
You imagine: 30 percent of the positions will remain unfilled due to lack of skills, especially in the world of data science and machine learning, so the most modern, most advanced skills.
So, from this point of view, we are a bit of a struggle to build the skills that we want to see in our organizations of the future.
We chase them.
Another interesting fact is that about 66 percent of CIOs, the managers of companies' IT infrastructures, say that the scarcity of talent is approaching crisis dimensions, so it is becoming a very strong theme.
Another very important element: artificial intelligence and automation and robotization are changing the world of work.
The same BCG study, which I invite you to read, is called: "12 forces that are changing the way organizations work" has certified that, within the next 10 years, 70 percent of the professions we do today will have changed drastically or even disappear.
And, if we look at what the World Economic Forum says, two-thirds of children studying in primary school today are preparing for jobs that do not yet exist.
Impressive, if I think of my children who now attend elementary school.
Another theme: the average life of some skills, of some engineering skills, has dropped drastically and today it is between two and a half and five years.
What does that mean?
That if a person does not put himself in mind to invest in himself and to play the game of continuous learning will be, in a short time, not very "employable", not very employable.
But there are also some softer forces that are changing the world of work.
For example, having a strong culture within the organization.
The fact that about 90 percent of companies consider culture a distinctive and competitive factor for the success of the organization is certainly something very significant, very important.
And, from this point of view, there is correspondence.
Because even the people who live in organizations are putting culture and a sense of purpose at the center of their journey.
62 percent of millennials don't want a job, they don't want a salary, they don't want an office job.
He wants to have a career that has a strong social impact.
And, this is my opinion, it is probably not only millennials who want a job, a career that helps them to have a strong social impact.
Another soft force that is changing the world of work is the increasing attention to the world, the theme of diversity and inclusion.
In the United States, 80 percent of people employed in organizations say that it is a factor in choosing their position and the company that organizations put diversity at the center.
And 72 percent of the same people say they are willing to leave the organization they work for for an organization that is more inclusive and more focused on diversity.
Hence, it is becoming an element of talent attraction.
It's becoming such a strong theme that McKinsey did a study that showed that companies that invest seriously in diversity and inclusion are 15 percent more likely to achieve financial success.
So, it's not just something nice, nice to work on.
It is a differential factor for the economic results of the organization.
Finally, work, and this is probably the center of reasoning, is increasingly fluid and flexible.
There are - there is the explosion of co-working spaces.
In Italy we have some wonderful success stories on this issue.
Smart working has become a theme at the heart of corporate strategies.
The observatory on smart working of the Politecnico di Milano claims that most companies in Milan have now adopted smart working strategies.
And then there is another theme, equally important: skills are being formed in places where, until a few years ago, it was unthinkable to see them.
Think about how many graduates there are who are coming out of computer engineering in India or China.
And this is forcing organizations to rethink their strategies.
If, until yesterday, organizations put an office where it made sense to put it and then attracted talent, today the same organizations are questioning themselves, they are wondering if this strategy is really the right one.
And they're putting the venues where the talent is.
The explosion of jobs, especially with technological content, in India has been very strong in recent years.
Work is increasingly fluid and flexible: it is increasingly normal, more and more common to see a work team where the boss is based in Washington and the five members of his staff are based in Caracas, Madrid, Greece, Shanghai or Sydney, maybe on 5-6 different timezones.
So, from this point of view, do you still need the office?
I have my doubts.
I have my doubts because, as I told you, in a world of work that is changing very strongly, where skills are increasingly scarce, the war for talent is increasingly strong, the world in which artificial intelligence, automation are changing the way organizations work, in a world where the issues of the sense of purpose and diversity of inclusion are returning to the center,  In an overbearing way, business strategies, in a world where, evidently, organizations are increasingly fluid and flexible, I think no, it does not make much sense.
And so, here, my idea, very simple, very clear: to help our children overcome prejudices, to question them.
And to remove them, if they have any.
Because the world of work is changing, the world of work will be characterized by an activity that is done with more and more passion, more and more with more sense, always with more desire to focus on that theme of continuous learning that I have tried to represent.
And so our purpose is this: to talk to our children about this topic, to talk about how, from a practical point of view, work cannot be a physical space, it cannot be the office.
We don't "go to work," although we often say so.
We do, a job.
And so, my point is exactly this: work must necessarily be our story to our children.
Something you do, certainly not a place you go.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon, good afternoon everyone.
Today I bring you into my world.
I'll tell you about diversity in the blockchain world.
But let's take a step back: what is blockchain?
The blockchain is a new layer, layer, of the Internet that has fundamental characteristics: it is open, incorruptible, immutable, transparent and decentralized.
And it is commonly called web 3.0.
If web 1.0 was the era in which companies communicated directly with users, and there was a two-way communication, let's call it: companies promoted, perhaps, their products on the Internet; and users were buying directly on e-commerce; And the era of Web 2.0, instead, was the era in which users began to interact with each other, to exchange information and data on blogs, social media, etc., the blockchain allows the introduction of the exchange of value without intermediation.
We know that this technology will have an impact in many industries, not only in the world of finance; And we know that we have to get there prepared.
We do not know when this will happen, but we know that not only must we arrive prepared in terms of products but also of the workforce, precisely, that constitutes, builds this new world, this new technology.
For example, in my company we believe in this vision of 'tokenization' of everything, in the so-called 'tokenization of everything.'
That is, we think that any asset, any form of value, tomorrow - whether it is a house, a car, a precious metal, a luxury object, a work of art - can be transformed, digitized into a token that can then be exchanged on this blockchain, on this new technology.
To give you some examples, imagine the companies that work in the textile sector or in the food industry, which can thus control all the processes of the supply chain in key, for example, of anti-counterfeiting; or think of art lovers, who cannot afford to buy a painting, for example by Andy Warhol, but can invest in a fraction of that work of art and can exchange this fraction, this token, with other fractions of works of art, always in key, precisely, of investment.
But if we know that blockchain is a technology that will impact everyone's daily life, through many products, the workforce that composes it must reflect this technology, it must be able to speak to everyone.
Today I'm going to talk about diversity, so what I represent a bit in my world.
And to tell you about it I looked for the definition: I wanted to arrive with a nice definition of diversity, in reality I found many, one different from the other, because we constantly hear about it in many keys.
It is related to sexual orientation, ethnicity, socio-economic background.
In my opinion, the best definition of diversity in a corporate perspective is the ability to create a workforce where everyone, whoever they are, feels first and foremost and feels that they are contributing to the construction of the future of this company.
Intuitively, we know that diversity is a positive factor: now there are also researches that show us, with data, effectively, that companies that implement, precisely, this characteristic, this factor, at all levels of their management, from top management down, also have greater financial return.
And this suggests to us that it does not only concern gender diversity, man or woman, but all the diversities that we have mentioned before.
But why does this happen?
Why are companies with more diversity more successful in the market?
Because they know how to listen more to what's going on out there, they develop a different sensitivity to understand what, actually, consumers want.
But where are we now, in this historical moment, of diversity in the world of technology, of technical companies, which then concern my world, but not only?
We at Circle, my company, wanted to understand, indeed, the interest of women in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, more specifically, which are our field.
So we did a survey, in the United States, which is one of our markets, on more than 3,000 people, in an age range from 24 to 74 years.
Guess what?
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are of interest to males, millennials, whites.
That is the state of affairs.
And the results we got, cross-referenced with other research, other surveys, are always the same: there's about five percent, roughly -- just five percent of women who make up the workforce in this field, who are founders of blockchain companies, investors, enthusiasts, engineers.
What I want to tell you today is that to work in the blockchain world you don't need to be a 20-year-old nerd, who are all day in front of a computer and have a degree in engineering, are passionate about finance, investments.
For example, think of me: today I will tell you briefly about my journey, because I think it is no coincidence that I have sought this type of innovation and technology.
I come from a completely different field.
I come from the world of the sharing economy, I didn't study engineering or science: I studied economics, and then I did marketing.
For study, and for work, I have lived a bit around the world, in the sense that I have always been, since I was a child, an "early adopter", I define myself as such.
I was always the first who wanted to try something new, who wanted to find out what was the innovation that would be successful, shortly thereafter.
And I was lucky, because my first example - I grew up alone with my mom.
So my family consisted of me, my mom and my little dog.
And she always pushed me -- instead of tying me, holding me, she always encouraged me to try, to do, to go.
And so I did, in the sense that first, from the province - I grew up in the middle of the Piedmontese fog, I spent my first 19 years there - then from the province I went to Milan to study.
After three years in Milan - which was my dream, it seemed to me an unattainable thing - Milan was already mine, and it was time to continue for the next adventure.
And so I lived, precisely, for different reasons, study, work, in New York, London and Paris.
Just think that when I was entering the world of work, the tech wave of startups was just arriving in Europe.
And I immediately realized that I wanted to be part of that field there.
And although it was much riskier than working in the big multinationals already started, I wanted to do that thing there.
I wanted to find economic models that would impact the lives of millions of people, when people did not yet realize it.
And so I discovered there was a small, then, Californian company that was looking for the first people to open the European market: at the time there were 100 people in all, in the company.
So I sent my CV, and you think, after two hours they replied.
After a week I was hired.
And together with two other guys, we opened up the Italian Uber market.
I worked in Uber for four years, it was an experience, for me, decisive and beautiful, honestly.
After four years in the Italian market, I said: now I want to try another challenge.
Send me to India, I want to work in an emerging market that has a whole other scale than Italy, I want to see what happens there, how this technology moves there.
I arrive in India, I live in Mumbai for a few months and there I hear, for the first time, about blockchain, which I honestly did not know before.
And I start to get passionate.
So I understand, I feel it, I say: here, here we go again.
Now that the sharing economy is an established, successful model, which is impacting all areas of the world, I want to stand out, I want to try again this new technology, this new innovation, in which no one yet believes.
And so I start looking for companies that operate mainly in this sector, and I come across my current one.
I tell you honestly that I was a bit hesitant, because I said: sure that I find myself a team of males passionate about technology who fiddle all day in front of the computer.
And I don't have a sledgehammer in there.
They make me the selection process, and in the selection process I fall madly in love with my company and my colleagues.
First of all, I meet my head, who is my myth; and then I meet many women who have key roles in the company, from the Europe communication manager to the Europe manager of the legal world.
And so these two factors: the selection process, in which I feel absolutely welcomed and I understand that there is the right space for me; And in addition the innovation factor, I wanted to be among the first to try, to find that thing, certainly pushes me to become part of this world.
But let's take a step back: the world is made up of 50% women and 50% men.
And we know that technology -- what's the ultimate goal of technology?
Solve everyone's daily problems.
As a result, it goes without saying that companies, even the workforce that creates these products, must also reflect this gender mix.
I believe that companies, but not only, including institutions, have a key role in this.
Let's start from institutions, from education: as there are courses for children related to the world of computer science, but not only: MBAs, masters with classes, competitions dedicated to computer science, there should also be for the world of blockchain and technology.
I want to tell you about this episode, which is nice and, fate wants, it happened to me the other night while I was writing this speech, and then I said: I have to tell it.
There was a television program in the background, "La TV delle ragazze," and there was Amalia Ercoli Finzi, who I discovered to be the first Italian woman graduated in space engineering, who told something, for me, very simple and very interesting.
He said: girls must be given the Meccano and a doll.
But not because all girls have to become engineers: this will not happen.
But if one of them wants to be an engineer, she must know that she can do it.
To tell you about this episode, I looked for gender, the feminine declension of the word engineer.
And I discovered that there are words that do not include feminine gender: for example, the word surgeon, the word engineer, the word mayor, think about it.
This is, let's say, the role that institutions have, for example with regard to education: insert dedicated courses, and give girls the opportunity to discover this world, to approach it immediately.
And what is the role of companies?
Well, definitely, to expose their female leadership: let's show them, these women.
Let's have them do interviews, let's expose them in the media.
We show that behind the success of these companies there are women, young people, who have traveled all over the world, who have impressive resumes.
And on the other hand, certainly, the selection processes are transformed.
This, in my opinion, is a very interesting research that HP has done.
Think that a woman applies for a role if she feels 100 percent in line with that role; A man applies to a position if he feels 60 percent in line with that role.
Imagine, in my fintech sector, how difficult it is: we combine finance and technology, which are par excellence two sectors, two male areas.
How difficult it is to attract good women candidates, who can potentially make careers, can be instrumental in writing the blank canvas of this technology.
And the approach to CVs also changes.
The CV no longer becomes the backbone of the selection process, but it is up to the human resource to identify what is the appetite, the talent of that person, looking at finding more, perhaps, in the "soft skills" than in the "hard skills."
Maybe on the curriculum it has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, or blockchain - as in my case, I had nothing to do with it.
Or maybe in her free time she is an investor, she is an investor in the world of cryptocurrencies, maybe she has already informed herself for her passion, for her interest.
So, this is what we, as companies, must propose to do.
And we individuals?
What is our role?
Well, today I have brought you a little into my world, I have told you this reality that is composed of men, women.
Just think that I had five leaders in all: three women and two men, one of whom was black and homosexual.
And for me they are - I aspire to be like them: that is, they are not a source of inspiration, more.
What you can do, however, from tomorrow each of you must begin to inform yourself: you do not necessarily have to apply, but start chewing the matter, begin to understand what it is.
Maybe you find yourself passionate, maybe you start to take an active role and not to simply receive, passively, this revolution when it happens in the lives of all of us.
Because it will happen, and it will have an even bigger impact, even deeper than what the Internet has had for 20 years.
What I encourage everyone to do - if I had to say to a student who has just come out of university, but also to you, I would say: take a backpack, throw a shirt in it and go to Asia, where this world is already very much underway.
Start going to events, aperitifs, meetups.
Start to understand what it is.
And do a bit like this little girl behind me, who throws herself, in total unconsciousness but also amused, on this new medium that she does not know, following her predisposition, in fact.
And enjoy this adventure.
And this is precisely what I encourage you to do, and in short, everyone.
To do it now, at this time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
He is Juan, he is an indigenous Kaqchikel who lives in Guatemala.
An indigenous Maya, Kaqchikel.
And like the vast majority of indigenous Kaqchikels, they grow corn.
The Mayans believe they are made of corn.
Their god, Huracán, of the Popol Vuh, which is their holy book, creates them from corn dough.
So Juan, every year, before the dry season, sows corn.
Every year, he needs $500 to buy the seeds, $600 to buy the pesticides associated with those seeds, and $900 to buy the fertilizers associated with those seeds.
They call it a "complete technology package", they sell it to you like this.
A technology package that includes seeds, pesticides and fertilizers priced at $2,000.
Obviously, Juan doesn't have $2,000 and has to go to the bank to get them, these $2,000.
When he finally delivers, he sells the corn and has to return the money to the bank, it will have already become 2,400.
The problem is that when it goes to sell corn, in Guatemala, between Guatemala and the United States there is a free trade agreement, so that goods produced in Guatemala and the United States circulate freely between these two countries.
So when Juan goes to sell corn, he has to compete with corn produced in the United States, where it is produced that way.
Thanks to hyper-mechanized, industrialized agriculture, and large-scale cultivation, in the United States they are able to produce corn at an infinitely lower price than what Juan produces.
The price per quintal of corn has dropped so much that now Juan sells it at 10 dollars per quintal: they are 10 cents per kilo.
But the year went well, Juan managed to produce 50 quintals of corn.
So he will earn $5,000, which when we take away the $2,400 he will have to return to the bank means $2,600 for the entire harvest.
That's $220 a month.
But Juan still keeps some of that corn for himself, and then he also has a small vegetable garden and a few chickens.
Thanks to all this, he manages to guarantee himself, his wife and his three children 1,700 kcal a day.
These 1,700 kcal per day, which for us could be a perfect low-calorie diet, to knock down the bacon in view of summer, for Juan means losing 1 kg per month, every month.
12 kg per year, every year.
It's called malnutrition.
In Guatemala, 22 families own 76% of the land.
9.5 million farmers share what remains.
The appreciations are so small that they cannot produce who knows how much, and this makes Guatemala the tenth worst nourished country in the world.
2,244 kcal is the average in Guatemala.
The average.
These include the people in the cities, they include waste, they include the rich fats that live in the cities and they include millions of farmers who don't get to those fateful 2,000 calories, and they never will.
According to the World Bank, 49.8% of Guatemalan children under five are malnourished.
According to this World Bank study, 72% of Guatemalan households had to sell assets last year in order to buy food.
Asset, this word used by the World Bank that may seem to us an instrument of high finance, for a farmer, an asset means a hoe, a shovel, a plow.
It means selling work items in order to buy food.
So what does Juan do?
He sees a future, he sees something different.
He sees signs advertising a crop that could guarantee him much more income, and that is sugar cane.
A US company produces biodiesel in Guatemala.
They would lend him $3,000 directly, so the debt is greater.
But that same company guarantees him that it will buy him corn at the end of the year, for $ 6,000.
The earnings, for Juan, increase from 220 to 250 dollars a month.
It looks like the business of the year.
He tries, Juan.
He throws himself on sugar cane.
The problem is that at the end of the year he no longer has corn, and what seemed like a perfect business turns out to be a fiasco.
And so, from 1,700 its calories drop to 1,600.
No longer 12 kg per year, but 15.
He can't do it, he can't do it.
So what does it do?
He decides to sell his piece of land to the same company that will produce sugar cane on a large scale, and then sell biodiesel.
He sells his piece of land for about $7,000.
It is a good piece of land, for Guatemala, in a fertile area, in the plains.
He also sells his house, [is] about $6,000 what he gets out of the house.
And then he goes into debt again for $10,000.
With this 23,000 dollars, he will pay a coyote, a human trafficker, who will take him and make him cross Mexico, on this train that throughout Latin America is known as "The Beast": the train on which thousands of migrants cling every day.
Who leave, who flee their countries to reach the United States.
Juan will travel in inhumane conditions for a month.
Cling, sometimes tied up, for fear that if he falls asleep he falls downstairs.
Then tied to this silo that carries exactly that biodiesel that has been produced on its field.
Juan paid $23,000 to be smuggled from Guatemala to the United States.
That 500,000 liters of biodiesel are transported for the price of $350.
Why am I telling you all this?
And why me?
Well, because I lived in Latin America, in Guatemala, for a long time.
And I've heard hundreds of stories like Juan's.
So one day I said to myself that someone had to tell it, that someone had to come here and tell those stories.
But, to do that, first I had to deprive myself of something, I had to take something away from myself, I had to take away this shield that we all have, this protection that we have at birth, which is the most precious thing we have.
You will think, when one is born, a newborn child is told: "The important thing is health, the important thing is that he is well, the important thing is that he has money, that there is sun, that he is in a beautiful place, that he has the love of the family".
There is something much more important, something that is assigned to you randomly, the moment you are born.
One thing that cannot be touched, that is intangible, that we do not see, but that we all have.
And that is one of the most violent things ever invented: citizenship.
Citizenship represented by this stupid little brown booklet, which we all have.
When you are born, they give you one, it's a bit like winning the lottery.
I won it, because on mine it says "Italian Republic".
With this I have access to the best education systems and the best health systems.
With this, I can go to 173 countries without needing to apply for a visa.
There are people like me but they have written "Republic of Syria" on this passport and they don't go anywhere.
In 1853, the United States had to build the Transpacific Railroad, the one that runs, say, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
They had a problem, though: in the center of the United States, the Arizona area, they were all mountains.
And so they couldn't build the railway, I mean, it was complicated, it was a mess.
So what did they do?
They went to Mexico, which was on the bill, like today, and bought him a piece of land.
The sale of Mesilla.
Gentlemen in Washington drew a straight line, like this, in the middle of the desert, because they needed the plain to make the railroad.
Today, through that straight line passes the border.
There's a city, in that straight line, there in the middle of that straight line, which is called Nogales.
Nogales is divided into two: if you are born there, you have a U.S. passport.
You have access to the best schools.
to the best hospitals.
You have a passport that allows you to go to 167 countries around the world.
If you are born here, you are Mexican, and you don't do anything with your passport.
Did you think health was important?
The passport is important.
And the passport is assigned to you, perhaps, for a straight line drawn in Washington 160 years ago.
But I wanted to tell it, I wanted to live it like them.
And to do that, I had to get rid of this passport.
So I put it in an envelope, and sent it to a friend's house.
I disguised myself, I turned into a Peruvian migrant from the Amazon named Aymar Blanco.
I crossed the Suchiate River, which divides Mexico from Guatemala, and then crossed all of Mexico.
Since 1994, Mexico has been collaborating with the United States in blocking illegal immigration.
Every year, the United States pours between $4 billion and $6 billion into Mexico to let Mexico do the dirty work, which is to block Central and South American migrants.
So the border, now, is no longer just the passage between Mexico and the United States.
The border is the whole of Mexico!
And Mexico doesn't end anymore, it's very long, it's huge.
Depending on where you pass, it can be more than 4,000 km.
Much of the journey is covered clinging, stuck, sometimes tied like Juan to these freight trains.
Train that throughout America is known as "The Beast", or the train of death.
Father Solalinde called the train lines "the largest open-air cemetery in the world."
Every year thousands of people, perhaps falling asleep, or getting distracted, fall off the train and end up sucked under the rails.
This train is the emblem of the modern world: a train that travels, a huge train, freight, which does not carry out passenger service, which travels non-stop from south to north carrying cheap materials, but without transporting people.
Coal, iron, zinc, copper, machine parts, pieces of clothes, finished clothes, mangoes, papayas, bananas.
Everything travels freely without duties, without borders, without anything.
The only things traveling on that train illegally are human beings.
They kidnapped me three times during this trip.
A gang of hooded men, in the middle of the desert, after stealing everything from us, emptied our water.
They no longer knew what to do with it, now, and they emptied it before our eyes, only to make us suffer thirst.
I had to run, run away, jump off the running train over and over again, run faster than pregnant women and elderly gentlemen, in order to escape.
I had to plug my ears and eyes, not to listen to the screams of those who had not made it.
According to Amnesty International, 60% of women are raped during this journey before reaching the United States.
60%.
The federal police took us, arrested us, locked us in a cell of 4 meters by 4, in 40 people.
Two days, with 40 degrees during the day, without water, without food, without a bath.
40 people: we had to take shifts, to sit down.
Do not lie down, sitting.
There was no possibility of everyone sitting, we took turns: a little sitting, a little standing.
For two days in a row.
Forced to eat, drink, shit, piss, vomit, faint, all inside this space.
In one stretch the train was not there, it had been carried away by rains, and then there was a replacement service made with trucks.
And we walked 26 hours hidden in the double bottom of a truck.
When we finished, our joints were so ankylosed that when we got out of the truck we fell with our faces in the mud.
Our transporters laughed and drank tequila.
Nevertheless, driven by desperation, thousands of people make this journey every year and arrive at the border with the United States, and I with them.
We could basically divide the border with the United States into three.
You arrive, you have crossed all of Mexico but you still have to cross the border, you still have to get there in the coveted United States.
The easternmost part is the only part where there is really a natural border, which is the Río Bravo, which by the way is a river with a funny name because in the United States it is called the Río Grande del Sur, the great river of the south.
In Mexico it is called the Río Bravo, the bad river.
Hundreds, maybe thousands of people every year drown trying to cross it.
The current carries them into the sea and then there the currents of the Gulf of Mexico make fun of them, and take them to Texas, but dead.
The seven counties on the south coast of Texas have been in health emergency since 2008 due to the amount of deaths that are washed every day on their shores.
To the west, then, there is the wall: 1,223 km, the second largest separation barrier ever built by the human being.
In the 20 years of that wall there have already died, according to official estimates of the United States, 3,040 people.
To give you a comparison, in the 28 years of existence of the Berlin Wall the dead were 98.
Here we are talking about 3,040, officials.
In Mexico, estimates speak of 15,000.
Then, in the middle, there is nothing, there is a gap.
What else do you have to add, in addition to the Sonoran desert, a desert a third the size of Italy with temperatures that during the day exceed 40 degrees and at night go to -10.
Pima County, just across the border, declared bankruptcy in 2013.
He could no longer pay his electricity bill, to maintain refrigerators that kept 871 unidentified bodies of migrants who died trying to cross the desert.
That's where I came from.
You walk at night, in the cold, you hide during the day, under an atrocious heat.
Groups of "American patriots", Americans, poison the wells: one night we found a poisoned well, I was sick.
I owe my life to a Nicaraguan migrant whose name I don't even know.
As I was behind a cactus that I was vomiting, he grabbed me by the shoulder and said, "Oh, look, they're leaving you here.
You have to move."
Not everyone has a Nicaraguan guardian angel.
We left in 24 and in Tucson we arrived in 19.
Today, through that desert we want to expand, build yet another wall: a further barrier of separation between two countries, a further barrier that wants to prevent the human being from doing the most natural thing he can do: move, move.
We were apes 3.5 million years ago.
We came down from the trees to move.
We have assumed the upright position, bipedal to be able to walk long distances, to be able to move.
The history of the human being is made up of countless movements, countless migrations and movements from one place to another, in search of food, in search of partners.
Then you come back, you flee from catastrophes.
The human being moves.
Children learn to walk before they learn to actually use their hands.
Children walk before they speak.
They learn to walk before eating solid foods.
The human being is made to walk.
And no wall, no barrier in the world, no matter how big they can build it, no barrier in the world will ever prevent the human being from moving and moving.
Thank you.
(Applause) [Roots are important in a man's life, but we men have legs, not roots, and legs are made to go elsewhere - Pino Cacucci]
Today we talk about the future, young people, technology, but also tradition, know-how, art, beauty.
Today I take you to the factory, and I tell you about that extraordinary opportunity that lies on the border between mechanics and digital.
It was the early '80s, and I remember going to the workshop with Dad on Saturday mornings.
It was a mechanical workshop, or rather metalworking.
And they built very complicated parts for the textile and aeronautical industries.
As we walked through the workshop, I remember a dark environment, a strong smell of oil, my father running left and right to give instructions to anyone he met.
I remember men with big, strong hands, busy, with their heads inside the cars, inside their dark overalls.
I also remember a great order and cleanliness – my father always cared a lot about order.
I remember very precise mechanical details: they looked like jewels, works of art: know-how.
Let's jump forward, we are in 2017, we are in what is now called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0.
It is a phase of history that is characterized by less defined and wider boundaries than the previous ones.
Let's retrace them together.
The first: 18th century, the introduction of steam power for the operation of production machines.
The second, beginning of the 20th century, electricity, chemistry, oil, mass production and assembly lines - Ford.
The third, early 70s: electronics, computers, the first robots, factory automation.
This fourth is instead substantially characterized by a connection between the physical system and the digital system.
And it is very different from the previous ones for at least five reasons.
The first, speed: while the first took about 80 years to reach full impact, the second 50, the third 30, the fourth is hitting us like a tsunami.
Multidimensionality, amplitude: it does not only concern individual technological dimensions, but many in acceleration and in combination with each other.
It's not just about processes inside factories, it's increasingly about products, supply chains, business models – everything is interconnected.
Democratization: the cost of access to these technologies drops dramatically, so it is no longer reserved only for large companies but for an ever-wider public.
Human capital is at the heart of this fourth revolution, much more than it was in the first three.
It is a cultural revolution, even before it is technological.
The mechanical sector, like all the others, is not exempt from this great challenge and this great transformation.
Despite the great crisis that has hit the whole world, mechanics remains the pillar of Italian industry, an Italy that remains the second manufacturing country in Europe, and the fifth for added value in the world.
Mechanics alone makes 48% of Italian exports and realizes 82% of high and medium-high technology production.
We mechanics feel at the center of this fourth transformation observing a growing convergence between mechanics, digital and electronics.
Not only in processes, but increasingly in products.
The product of this convergence is what we call mechatronics.
This convergence will lead to 26 billion connected objects in 2020.
Increasingly intelligent products, designed to make our lives easier, to make it safer, that once on the market learn, collect a huge amount of data, feel, react.
How to do it, how does the way of doing business change in this context?
We in the company make products to move and dose fluids with great precision and accuracy, and given this increasing complexity we started asking ourselves this question several years ago.
In 2013 we created a completely separate place, a separate company, a knowledge enterprise where designers and engineers work together on the future.
It is a group of people that is at the center of a network of excellence made up of universities, research centers, experts, technological partners.
Working openly, acting and working as architects of innovation, combining technologies, people, knowledge.
This product is an example of the result of the work.
And it is a valve, a device to divert a flow, for use in the medical field – the extraordinary nature of this object lies in the fact that it has been, entirely, not only designed but also tested on the computer, through hundreds and hundreds of repeated simulations, which has been delegated the task of identifying and screening the highest possible number of configurations,  of geometries, to identify the best possible according to an objective-function.
The result was then realized by 3D printing, it was combined with a shape memory actuator, an intelligent material that serves as a sensor and also as an actuator, then as a motor.
All this is a connected product, part of those 26 billion objects able to feel, learn, react according to predefined rules.
These objects are then made in increasingly modern, connected factories, where the staff is hyper-qualified, without gender barriers – no longer, they design and govern complex machines that make the same very precise mechanical parts of which I have a memory as a boy – today, mechatronics.
But while all this is happening, while with great dedication and passion we ride this wave, let me go back for a moment: it was 2015, it was a Sunday morning, at home, with my three children, then 11, 9 and 6 years old and I was talking, as had happened on other occasions, about dad's work, the factory, the mechanics, all this great transformation.
It was not the first time, but this time it weighed particularly not to see in their eyes my own enthusiasm, and I began to wonder why.
This fascinating transformation that we live every day, this digital convergence, for our children, but [also] for families, for public opinion, are distant, unknown.
There is a dramatic gap between reality and perceived.
Well, we in the industry have never been famous for our storytelling skills: we prefer historically to do, than to tell.
I realized, in front of the eyes of my boys, that we were missing an important opportunity by watching as this gap grows.
Industry is the place where the most extraordinary transformations of our time are taking place.
And we must be able to tell this to our children.
In a new way, with new words.
A sense of social responsibility sparked in me, towards my boys in the first place but towards young people, towards industry, towards the country, because I realized that we were playing a lot.
So, as a good engineer, I decided to verify my feeling with data.
Involved the association of industrialists, we carried out an analysis of the perception from which it emerged, clearly, that the word metalworking, which still distinguishes our sector, were still associated with words such as: iron; blue jumpsuits; mass production; assembly line; dirty; fatigue; oil.
It looked like an image from the movie "Modern Times", by Charlie Chaplin.
We are talking about the Thirties.
Companies, people who point to the future, the protagonists of this transformation, are absolutely not associated with these words, but rather with: technology; precision; electronics; digital; mechanics; future.
All these words are associated with the term "mechatronics".
And so from here we started with a project to reposition the sector, to make it the first choice for our young people.
Promoting a cultural change, completely rethinking our way of telling ourselves.
And so we started by simply changing the name, from metalworkers to mechatronics, metalworkers for whom we were always known.
And then we created an image, a new identity that had to tell us in a simple way, to speak to everyone.
Then we went to schools, where we involved young people with the "director of companies" competition to tell through their eyes, through cinema, this new world of factories.
We have involved the foundation "Pubblicità Progresso" to go and tell this new change, also social, of work and the factory.
And then we went to the theater, to the Teatro Strehler in Milan where we told this change with the show "The importance of being called mechatronics", we told it talking about young people, the future, but also art and beauty.
Yes, because the products we make are beautiful, because they are generated by a way of designing that has beauty as the indispensable quality of doing.
And then we brought this project, and we are bringing this project, on a national scale, because obviously this is not just a Milanese problem, or a Lombard problem.
But let's go back to our young people, because it has been said that 65% of our children who enter elementary school today will do jobs that do not exist today.
And if we want the future that I have told you today to be sustainable, we will have to be able to involve them, inspire them, bring these guys inside.
Today, however, we start from a situation in which in Italy, [there is] 65% of difficulties in finding young people with training in technical-scientific disciplines.
On the other hand, however, we are told that we have 35% youth unemployment.
It is paradoxical, we are talking about two worlds that do not speak to each other.
But why do our children, and our families, make choices, choose paths without perspective?
Are they aware of this?
Or they choose, they deliberately make mistakes because they see this world so distant, difficult, complex and for which they choose, they make choices only apparently simpler.
Robots do not steal our jobs, but inadequate education.
On the one hand, the school model has not adapted to our times at all.
In this context, multidisciplinarity and ability to move in complex scenarios are fundamental; Creativity and problem-solving are crucial.
And at school you see very little of this.
The school should make known and experiment with those most relevant technologies of our time: I speak of blockchain, programming, Internet Of Things, Big Data, robotics, intelligent materials, Artificial Intelligence.
And I could go on.
And all this together, of course, with art, literature, mathematics.
The school should be the laboratory of the future.
It should be a springboard, to the future.
And then, formation must be felt and lived more and more also as an individual responsibility, of the young and the not so young, because today there are the tools and we cannot always wait for someone else to solve the problem for us.
And we, entrepreneurs, must take responsibility for our role, we must have the ability to convey the vision, the opportunity and the soul of this work.
We have to get out of business and we have to go to schools.
I do it as soon as I have the opportunity, and I assure you: I go out with the aim of inspiring young people and I come back inspired, because they are open, they are ready; It's up to us.
And we must also do this as informed, curious, aware parents.
And if you still haven't been convinced, come and visit our factories.
Come with your boys.
And come not only to the factories, but to all those places where the future is being planned: I am talking about incubators, business accelerators.
I am talking about university laboratories, I am talking about research centres.
Today Italy seems to have lost sight: our young people do not risk, they seem to have given up.
But I don't want to believe it.
Italy is a country with very deep industrial roots.
A fertile soil made of extraordinary brains, passion, tradition, creativity.
Of a capacity for combinatorial innovation that the whole world envies us.
Let's not throw all this away, letting our kids get lost chasing paths without a future.
Nelson Mandela said: "A winner is simply a dreamer who has never given up."
And if we want to make our boys win again, we must first return to inspire them and make them dream.
(Applause)
Some of the most attentive viewers might guess that they are in this area.
Let's keep a low profile!
So, I am a healthy bearer of optimism and I like challenges, in fact when they told me to choose where I wanted to talk about optimism, if in Silicon Valley or in Rovigo, Polesine, Italy, I had no doubts, because it can also be provocative to talk about optimism in this period.
It's actually very important what we believe this time to be and it's very important the vision we have of the future.
Why does the future have a lot to do with it?
The future has something to do with it because it depends on how you see your future, because from that vision arise the actions you do in the present, think for example when we choose a course of study: the first thing we think is: "Will it be useful when I finish it?
Will it help me find a job?
Will it help me have a better life?" So it is very important that we are aware of what we are experiencing, if the phrase that "we live in the best era in the history of humanity", not of the last 50-100 years, of humanity is true.
I am passionate about coaching, I know many coaches, but it was all invented by this here: Socrates was the only real coach, after us what do we do?
We make slides by changing the things he said, but the reasoning is his and the claim is simply to make people think.
Make you think to maybe have a different vision.
First of all, let's clear the field of a possible misunderstanding: I do not have it with the pessimists.
Pessimists and optimists make their contribution to the world.
If for the optimists we had the plane for someone who dreamed of flying, the pessimists invented the parachute, it is essential that they entered it.
Then it is true that if you jump with a parachute you have to be optimistic, because after ... Oh well, we do not enter a tour that no longer ends.
What is our view of the world?
If we look at the world as we have always seen it, perhaps on a map, what is the idea we have of this world?
With what eyes are we looking at it?
Maybe someone here in the room, expert in cartography, geography, will know that this map is not really correct, it reflects a bit the area where the first maps were built, in fact some continents do not have a size consistent with what they actually have in reality.
There is a map, it is called Peters' map, which represents more faithfully what is the greatness of the individual continents.
In this map you see behind me, can you see Italy?
Even those of the lodge who paid little?
Can you see it, even above?
Oh well, those who do not see zoom ... What now?
Well, we need a few more seconds.
Did you find it?
Well there's Italy, it's just shot.
This map is reversed, but in reality this map is the map that Australia's primary pupils have in their school books.
So who's on their feet?
Kangaroos or us?
Neither they nor us, but it is the different vision.
If we break away a little from our usual way of seeing things, perhaps we are able to grasp some aspects that we might miss.
We are experiencing a revolution.
If it is true that there have been many revolutions, many revolutions, in the world, the industrial revolution, think of the first industrial revolution: the end of the seventeenth century, the steam engine, the loom, which completely changed not only the production processes but also the interpersonal relationships, the very structure of society.
Two centuries later another revolution, called the second industrial revolution with the advent of the assembly line, with an extensive use of electricity, which changed further, creating trauma, creating fractures and then subsequent well-being.
Think of the third industrial revolution that we have experienced I think practically all, with the advent of the Internet, and then the last one we are experiencing now, which many define as the fourth industrial revolution, where we talk about genEtica and that capital E is not a typographical error, it is the sense of new problems that we will have to face.
Think that Google right now is not only hiring software engineers, it is hiring philosophers, to understand where the world that awaits us will go.
We talk about 3D printing, different connection speeds.
When we have a revolution, always the first reaction is fear: I remember my grandmother with the first cordless phone, it was a phone that no longer had wire, she was worried: "If the words are not in there, where do they go?" Changes are worrying, even the smallest ones.
One economist wrote, I would like to read with you, "We suffer from an attack of pessimism.
We have made faster progress in the last ten years than in all previous history.
The speed of technical change produces problems that are difficult to solve, the countries that suffer most are those that are not at the forefront of technical progress.
We are struck by a new malaise: technological unemployment.
A form of unemployment caused by the fact that we discover new ways to save labor at a faster rate than we discover new ways to employ labor."
This may be an article from today, but it was written in 1930.
And I don't need to tell you what happened in the decades leading up to the 1930s.
It is only to make you understand how much a change can, if not correctly interpreted, if not framed in a right vision, create fears, create fears, often unfounded.
One, the classic, is that sooner or later progress will end.
This is the thesis that obviously support the pessimists, those of the parachute, sooner or later progress will end.
In reality, however, we must think of progress as something that accumulates, does not run out, is added to things discovered, inventions, abilities that we had before, it is something that adds up, not that ends.
Obviously, progress can then be divided into the various areas of life and therefore we see that there are different rhythms.
If technological progress is there for all to see, as if it had a very steep curve, progress at the social level, not to mention the progress of the last line at the political level, is slower, because this is precisely the characteristic of this era.
The characteristic of this era is speed.
The changes are so rapid that our brain struggles to interpret them, it struggles to realize, and because of this we think that sometimes things can not change quickly for the better.
In reality, technological progress is offering us incredible solutions for everyone's well-being.
There are thousands of examples, look for example at the graph of the cost of mapping the human genome: 100 million dollars to do a mapping of the human genome in the 2000s.
100 million dollars, only the 2-3 richest people in the world could afford it.
A few years later it goes down, and it goes down with a very optimistic forecast that followed Moore's law, which is the one that tells us that every year the capabilities of microprocessors double.
So it was a very positive projection, "We will soon get from 100 million to 10 million", it means that instead of the two richest in the world will be able to afford it many millionaires.
And then an incredible thing happens, not even foreseen by the most optimistic scientists: that this price drops very quickly and today mapping, which cost 100 million dollars a few years ago, today costs less than a tablet, is within the reach of many people.
What happened?
It so happened that the studies of Frederick Sanger, one of the pioneers in this field, fourth person in the world to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry, were put online.
So we went from a series of concentrated intelligences, 5, 10, 15 researchers closed in a laboratory to 5, 10, 15, 50,000 researchers around the world, and this accelerated the ability to reason on this problem, bringing much cheaper solutions and within everyone's reach.
For example, one of the extraordinary characteristics that this future that we will soon live will have will be an absolutely transparent world.
I know it is provocative to talk about transparency here, but that will be the case.
This is a bus stop in Singapore.
With cigarette butts taken from the ground, the profiles of the people who had thrown them were reconstructed with traces of DNA.
From this profile, people take the picture, put it on the bus stop, "If you see I'm lame, tell them that they don't throw butts on the ground".
This is the transparency that we are seeing in many things, even in politics, in communication, as we said before, you cannot delete the thing from the internet and it becomes transparent, a world where we have control and we are increasingly protagonists.
Of course it is difficult to perceive this, because if we see that there are taxi strikes in Rome or Milan, maybe we have not seen that in July the first drone taxi was inaugurated in Dubai, which travels alone and is maneuvered with a joystick.
And I say: "But I would never go up there", it's the same thing we said the first time we went by plane.
We will go there, because it will work.
There are paradoxical aspects, maybe we can think that today's feature, the great progress is that we have generations of people glued to a smartphone screen, and it is true that in China and now also in Belgium they have made lanes on the sidewalks for people who are chatting.
One might even say, "But this intelligent progress doesn't seem to me."
In fact, there are things behind these advances that should make us think, for example when we talk about 5G.
We are thinking, those who have 4G, "Oh well, what will 5G be?
It will be a little faster connection, I can download for example a movie -- legally I mean -- so when I have paid for it, 1 gig I can download it in 7-8 seconds.
A real wonder!"
Actually it is not only this, because this changes you an evening in which you do not know what to do at home.
In reality, 5G networks will have a wider and more powerful capacity than fiber optics, they will finally allow automatic driving in cars, they will allow remote operation with even greater ease and with even greater precision, they will enter our lives, the internet of things will be a reality because these objects will be able to interact with each other at speeds unthinkable today.
And so I say that if you're not optimistic, with everything we have, it's because you probably lack data.
Today the irrational person, who looks to the future, is the pessimist.
And what do we teach our children?
What can we teach our children if statistics and research tell us that 65% of primary school pupils will do a job that does not exist today?
What can we teach him?
I believe that we can teach them, and we can also learn, to be better people, people who call themselves optimists, or those people who transmit positive energy, have common characteristics and I would like to analyze them with you briefly.
They are first and foremost honest people, and it is a revolutionary word in this era, they are normal people, it is not that an optimist has paresis.
Loc
It has its positive moments and its negative moments, it is the different vision.
It is true that they smile often, optimistic people smile often, then they have the ability to share their good mood with other people, they never stop making plans.
Whether they are 20 years old, 30 years old, 70 years old, they don't stop making plans.
They have a unique and extraordinary feature - they emphasize positive things.
We all have negative things in our lives and probably if we make a list they come out right away.
And the positive things, how long would it take us to make a list of positive things in our lives?
But if you have a parent, a child, a friend who loves you, a hospital within a radius of 50 km, electric light, drinking water, these are things that should not be taken for granted.
I understand that one does not have to come home, open the tap and say: "Long live the aqueduct society!".
That would be excessive, but you have to realize that this makes you a lucky person.
People who transmit positive energy are generous people, who help others, this we can teach and this we can practice.
They are not prejudiced nor are they afraid to transmit, to show their affection.
So, being optimistic maybe today is simply one thing: it is going back to believing in people, but not because man is capable of creating a 5G network or because he is able to transport passengers with a drone, because man is capable of doing the most wonderful thing that has ever appeared on this Earth: another human being.
And a person who has this ability cannot help but make you think positively about the future.
So how do I change the world?
There are many who want to change the world, few think about how to change themselves.
I believe that if you really want to change the world, it's simply a matter of being the best version of yourself.
Thank you
