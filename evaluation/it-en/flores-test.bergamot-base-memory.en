This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely circulated theory, but it provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to the scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also allows to obtain detailed information about the evolution of the feathers of the birds.
Since dinosaur plumage is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and stumbs, the researchers concluded that the spine is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers speculate that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick duvet.
According to the researchers, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

The effect sought by the team was to be provoked by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force over the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a species of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to serve as Minister for Business who was left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and the driver, 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo face reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon didn't explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from one eye, misses a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified by videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 out of 116 competitors in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race she competed in, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's group of the "sitting" category, with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes than the first runner-up, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female group skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cellphone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found his cell phone and his laptop.”
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the crash of the car was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened was closed temporarily, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on suspicion of murdering his own son.
She is detained pending indictment and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who post photos or other of suspicious subjects, walk on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for prosecutions, has told reporters that no new comments will be released until at least the formal indictment.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in partnership with the association Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first firing operation received exhaustive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a nine-member, new, Provisional Election Council (CEP).
This is the fifth provisional Martelly Election Council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called "absolutely despicable" the postponement of the report by Apple.
The earthquake in the Marians was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signs in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed immediately along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced themselves with an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
After following the training in obstetrics, in 1959 he entered to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recordings.
Even his wrestling companions wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, exactly like you. A strong woman."
"Moon was weird as I was... Maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the poll conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to the passage of Australia to republic increased 8% compared to 2008.
In the course of the campaign for the 2010 federal election, the interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, said he believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 per cent of the poll participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II is expected to be Australia's last monarch.
On opposites of the poll, 29 percent of respondents say Australia must become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent are of the opinion that they should never become one.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he blamed several ailments that caused him to doubt his fitness.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to this day.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that led water and organic matter to the earth, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth was formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since earlier this year as governor; last month he placed his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "political talk and idiocy."
A presidential candidacy is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology instead of outdated ground-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport is not being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while no car parking or interchange parking is available on site.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have brought out the possibility of having the game played on closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time it took for this process was much greater; this was due to the mating between an endemic Darwin finche, Geospiza fortus, and the immigrated cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed in all forms. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled in foils.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "minimated codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can construct a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) is the chemical element.
The pH level of the animal known is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remains of sewage networks.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in the public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To phone someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite's launch into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere partly distorts light and visual.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, which vary from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in freedom) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The niche concept is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called packs.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The herd of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, the behavior of which is in fact surprisingly similar to that of the lions (but not to that of other large cats), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it more resembles a phrase of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) thanks to smell, sniffing to the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelotti blend in with their surroundings and then swoop in on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment other than the one in which it was previously found.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to place itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide ejected from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his era and for this reason he feared nothing, except the other mosasaurs.
From his long jaws more than 70 sharp teeth sprang up like razors, plus a further row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their foods would look familiar to us, the Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on their chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the abode of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurat, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the home was not of paramount importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family was held outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it his name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Despite being all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars," you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, this is fake. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measurement 29.75 inches for 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the clashes that followed had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American forces and those of the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in some way also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, not being so recognized as actual civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on the often uncooperative state authorities for the application of their own acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
To modify the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required. These for their part had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
Almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu) are part of the Japanese, making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", given the presence of groups of islands that compose it.
Taiwan was born in the fifteenth century, when the European sailors who transited soon recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwest part of Taiwan, beginning a transformation that concerned the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and taking Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus surrendering the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is the 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, what is more important, its aspect ratio is inherited from the formats of the image sensors of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derided rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had been acting as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite the differences in language and custom.
His ubiquitous power has influenced anyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent the access of any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
Because this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of much of the citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and heinousness of World War I, the nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, fierce wars were ignited among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the Army rankings, instead of being based on the class, are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to begin their revolution.
Muhammad had deep interest in the issues that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the "noor" (light) mountain to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a great deal of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has come to the present day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" to a staple or square without the underside.
Upwards it means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downwards it means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it is a louder and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the signs of the arching you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Teresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds swung in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits underlying US imperialism.
To understand the Templars we must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when events took place is commonly called the Early Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that the destiny of man is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a greater percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, and culture related to such geography have arisen, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been found to be more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued to approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its prestige diminished, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can delay by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing sufficient to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most of the farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who feel unrestants of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, as a result of misfortune, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the refusal of serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before neglect or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When the feral child is totally bred by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, how much more help for those undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the small handscraff-shaped assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on his own.
Children are given in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nutrition, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care is supposed to make up for all the unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use theory and gratification.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet, "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995) are suggested.
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships."
The use of video recording has made it possible to arrive at significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of variability expressed.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense as savanna chimps do today.
Discontinuation of sleep is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If you decide to reset the watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve the consumption of a lot of fluids before sleep (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force exists. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach the lighting. This goal is only hampered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayan rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has foundation in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the centerpiece of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts resulted in the break between the two countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken down; the only option was to beat in retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans proved immediately obsolete, at the time when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the protection of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had a chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to easily have milk, fleece, flesh and skin available.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move in the hills or other grazing areas, often looked after by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of pastoralism are still used nowadays.
In the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were formed simply by parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared with the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear and tear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails completely made of iron appeared.
The first means of transport that the man knew was the legs. Humans began walking in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the australopithecus, did not routinely walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, on the other hand, we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "The Posters of Dunlap".
The document was first read for July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had her read to her troops stationed in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They're the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all the computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a container of drugs or harmful chemicals open.
Check if there are first aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to becoming human parasites.
Both killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nests, i.e. adapted to live in their guest's nest or home.
In the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) recorded about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in that of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific survey.
But it is not just about the experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations allows you to orient scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and depending on whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on the spot include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to drive to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic comings and goings, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stability conditions that has enabled human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that fall into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers designing them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex since the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Thankfully, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably steady range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To achieve a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly has allowed them to escape the enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most of the insects are benefited by the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small ravines to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist nowadays, the only ones that are not able to fold the wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man called the Aristarch claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and the other stars) itself, moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. In it pour the waters of thousands of minor tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The language of Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people who work within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact look more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys made up of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After her invention, the pencil turned out to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something newer comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. Then, further subdividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
Marias may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most common content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Needs hierarchy and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put disciplinary actions into practice, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire work of the team and do it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This attitude often generates dissent between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is defined as the "invisible team" and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have a willingness to deal with the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When you can use all the resources available effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s needs.
In order for an organization to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. The search area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously observed brain structures and processes.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong sci-fi connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computing that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some application examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, speech and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into several applications software for home computers and video games.
Trips are a key part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that you can't reach by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual outings. Students can see the artifacts of the museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a poorly cared for grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively answering Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outlining their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, among them some are almost uninhabited wild land.
If you make a comparison of the population, the result can be surprising to many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of the actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one looking too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be a harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose it (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to reconstruct it under the name of Casa Branca, who abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan re-edified the city called Daru l-Badya, then named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping cities.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of chincaglieria, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document yourself well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to well assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorbike) to move around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In PBS's special by Henry Louis Gates "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its most arabic touch than African, the city stands out clearly from the others of the country.
Kruger National Park (KRP) is located northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which gives sustenance to a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are made for storage and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront in front.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development has focused on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point from which to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal swath of mangroves in the world. It stretches for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove marshes: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated that there are 400 royal tigers in Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since often the service buses between different districts are full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and rugged small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast means to the nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-staired bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, in Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trells have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the space in free vertical is 15 meters. Construction ended in August 2011, but traffic opening only took place in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge is expected to be totally functioning.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the sixteenth century from the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are typically accepted anywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can often pay with US credit cards and dollars.
Credit cards are likely not to be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months the temperatures over 30 ° C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: rarely temperatures reach below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the sight of humans, wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining a proper distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space since they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the sadly known naval stall of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to abandon the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 U.S. and German lives have been lost.
In the course of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay to north to Devonport to the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are family-friendly beaches sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can take a bath safely.
The best known local beer is an uncomplex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
You can have many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones could better face the journey.
The water of the local tap is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, the bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions to the reef and injuries to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow the instructions and pay special attention to the security alerts.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period you can only find occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
Booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space near the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the crossing of the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include the time to devote to exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much as possible the time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are neither windows, no clocks, and the outputs can be hard to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of guests up so that they stay.
In some rooms alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of intoxication alters the capacity for judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy carriageways, the friction is reduced and you can't drive like when you're on the clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, in no time can fall so much snow that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or ice formation or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the hub of many visitors’ holiday.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most tickets for events is expected to be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, although they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try it with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid narrowing or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these turn out to be more effective against specific risks.
In certain areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, for this reason, in case of doubts it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers can come into contact with animal pests that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise goods in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you are not in the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and tight curves predominate.
The exposed speed limits are much lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich in flavor sweets can be oriented on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can occur both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the inland regions, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally indicates the foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the knight's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems for the possibility of the knight's feet getting stuck in it.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the horse running away. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
For one thing, most knights wear horseback boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Afterwards some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to come off the saddle when, in case of a fall, the knight pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs were drawn.
Peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new routes on its walls, potentially endless.
Free downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are widespread and involve sliding on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (the ski disbursements), who dedicate entire holiday periods to the ski activity in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings with the depiction of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is connected, although it does not usually include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you can cover somewhat greater distances than those traveled, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would have to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass your passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences from the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, though more recent than similar items mass-produced.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of subsistence for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not always all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming; some lived fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer especially as work animals.
Today many Sámis carry out modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveler warning were to be issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in the event of a travel cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but you still keep in mind that such opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression by which any dangerous weather phenomenon is indicated that can cause damage, serious social hardship or loss of life.
In every part of the world, extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, precipitation above normal and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the weather phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are the storms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about the adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they could affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching the Internet for ‘Course on hostile environments’ is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually making use of practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
The books and magazines that deal with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning surgery to change sex abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without guidance regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections at security checks also became much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being dented.
The undertow currents consist of the return flow of the waves crashing on the beach, often near a reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming again will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don’t risk being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and if you’ve been spotted.
The re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the culture shock (being a smaller "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met people patient and understanding, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a short story book.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed from various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that is located south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without coverage for mobile, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone does not typically constitute a replacement for the mobile phone, because to call you must find yourself outdoors with clear views up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including recreational craft, as well as missions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education when you return to your country of origin.
Usually enrollment in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for arches and lakes.
Although coastal archpelakes and larger lakes are definitely vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where you count one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground you will not need a separate visa (starting from 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people to understand a bit how planes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or the fact that they are not in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it the fastest would be to send it as hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: approximately, you can expect to shell out up to four times the normal economic fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first-class ones!
In general, direct flights from A to B are not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business class seats.
Airlines know full well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and consequently apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of an ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Orthodox Christian religion.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and a major transport crossroads.
The ancient city of Izmir is spread over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although in the city you can breathe an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are dotted with the characteristic red roofs, the market of the eighteenth century and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. She became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of her splendours written by Lord Byron.
The bus Scotturb 403 regularly connects to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has an almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen loved ones murdered or made to work to the death, both Jewish and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid disfiguring these places by smearing the structures with marks or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known to virtually everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the subway, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service outages are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to find yourself well in Paris continues to be to behave at its best, relating as a "bien élevé" person (well behaved). This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The rude outward appearance of Parisians will fade quickly if you show off some basic good manners.
The national park of the Plitvice Lakes is rich in woods, mainly of beech, pecci and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the rooster cedron, next to several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries make available to the stoles for the women who come unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to the knees.
These too can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, such as that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "She", always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as you write.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowal.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while cart means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and more often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in comprehension of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Usually nowadays premodern observers are obsolete and act as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not as problematic as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are huge facilities in remote areas where weather conditions are favourable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was native to China, where the flowering of the prunes was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, collecting some specimens of plants will also cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to turn around; you can buy pretty much anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to catch reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie canal.
In addition, they define the routes of hiking trails and well-known bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual related to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional Churches, an Easter vigil is celebrated on the night of Saturday the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the strike of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came to us by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, the mammals could not face the journey. This caused the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats have been introduced to the Galapagos after man's arrival.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost throughout the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution often does not pose a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than the one to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
The office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or suit and you turn to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is crucial, as it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than to commend individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors about every decision, and they are expected to abide by the instructions without asking questions.
