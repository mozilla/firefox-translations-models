Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. president to receive Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque over 1.4 million. Dollar for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The White House chief arrives in the northern Way metropolis tomorrow along with his wife Michelle and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time ever with the five committee members who elected him in October out of 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third to accept the prize directly in office.
The White House has already said that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when it comes to taking over the prize.
The president doesn't want to dodge this issue because he knows he's taking the award as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (approx. 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The programme of events then envisages a banquet with the president and his wife, which will be attended by the prime minister and another 250 invited guests in addition to Norway's king and queen.
Obama was very reluctant from the start to the price.
He cited, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the price.
Several times he also reiterated that it is the price not only for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is "call to action" for him.
Conservationists are accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he filed appeals against some construction proceedings in recent years, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz nature conservation community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in custody and he faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you will find the sorting garbage containers again at every turn.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I don't mean to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors are insufficiently caring about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the jungle league, not only because we as citizens here are only allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Did they try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at some point in the center?
This is art, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moravian Square opposite the Goose Hit.
Mr. Onderka should not be angry with his colleagues, but this seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not a honey lick in other parts.
That's why it's better not to sort the waste from all my friends.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles even after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street I did not see any paint bins in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when driving the tram.
The garbage almost overflowed.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic probably leaves the Brno socialists cold.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey league that will shame us all over the republic rather than buy a few more garbage cans and offer the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was also able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party, despite the view of the government, gave the farmers and civil servants more money, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings business.
But also not for the public debt interest rates or for the international court disputes.
That is causing even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the finance minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they reckoned that the government would borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sick pay in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mine laying," says Janota.
From the loans, especially higher interest rates are paid, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose, where to get from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
Around the pensions or the sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state is in debt even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster and together with this also the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government made in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the money transfer in favor of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of the highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly cheaper.
Most of all, which is not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, the European money creation is also endangered, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it dissolve the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from these then the money is distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never secure and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion went into the budget from CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to the rules of the EU, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent GDP.
But that does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and of offenses, or for expenses for the court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay for that anyway, Janota makes clear.
The minister must then save the money in-house or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the two billion project "Staatskasse", which has already started, which should make it possible to monitor on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
Should the finance minister not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and Windows Mobile will turn Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are to come to the customer within the year 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Snowless slopes are not only of concern to the giant mountain range residents.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve received.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People are going through the offers, setting the prices, but by now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if, in our opinion, this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, cited.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and in which the quality of the stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now mainly only offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will make an effort for a while to sell them, but then they too will have to give in, and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly dwindle, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That's why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, cited.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest for the winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and for Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also go well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also 80 percent occupied for the New Year’s Eve stays at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are currently already occupied to about 60 percent.
February is now a bit weaker, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, said.
The giant mountain hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall, this should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming is to come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is mother of cleverness
It's almost weird with what student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote them off via the copy paper from the bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" in the text himself several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea - to send out fresh troop quotas to Iraq plagued by the civil war - as an "irresponsible and in its conclusions carastrophic decision."
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy, which was made by recommendations of the military, was the only possible and very successful in so far as that today the news about Iraq is no longer spoken at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful initial situation than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military has again asked him to increase the contingent of troops, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House despite the subordination habits.
He called for 40,000 troops to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months but has come up with no better idea and so he has cheated the general at least around 10,000 troops.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
The very problem with the whole Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the brotherly war of recent years, Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honoring the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - you can rely on nobody and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is hard to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only sham buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
Also, building a "capable state" that is the minimalist goal of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only continued to deteriorate and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
Believe that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry over the "early return" create a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul, which is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take that as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush Mountains foreland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America is moving to Obama for the winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy, if it would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which you can only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they are overly risky.
Goldman Sachs puts itself at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance, according to the Reuters agency.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction it has to go in, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made itself the target of criticism after setting aside nearly 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars, according to the agency Reuters, even despite the measure indicated today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a whole range of countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain reported Wednesday that it intends to charge the bonuses of bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds once with a 50 per cent tax.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone sector.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for enlightenment of the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the fiber optic sector and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chamberas, fax machines or astronomical telescopes, have passed this award.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medail and certificate of the acquisition of the cash prize.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
According to tradition, the American president, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and in addition is at the head of the country, which is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In upholding his policies, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight for world peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the finance minister, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he disagrees with the execution of the state budget for next year in the form that this was released by the Assembly of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps also the whereabouts of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the public finance crisis.
The meeting was informed by the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota plans to negotiate with the Premier, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his further remaining in his capacity.
According to the Budget Act, which is now granted to Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In parliament, however, the Left Party proposals on the money circulation were voted on Wednesday and the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of the farmers was increased.
The government has countered the Social Democracy's proposals that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has therefore arisen, because of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer civil service cabinet, on the design of which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the fishing government in the autumn, and that, according to their understanding, is supposed to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can, but does not have to, sign the law on the state budget, declared today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem" that "the untenable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no longer a good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could still build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is atrocious, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS chief executive, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servant cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong sayings."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was atrocious, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the world's new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows much of the country, of whose struggle and victories, despite some criticisms, the lead role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman, in his life story.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela whether he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another meaningful role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby," already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, which has become a slave owner at the end, a fictional USA president, and also God in "Evan All-power," but only rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time that is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true incident in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to make the country a few. New President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes he can agree on his people through the sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team advances to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were to be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I've found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it is important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players outweighed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects of an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good history, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested not far from the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful and the missile, called the type "Bulava," which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also, his repeated presence on the ground at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the trial flights.
Bulava has mostly not started at all or been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "rocket that does not fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly, but glows
This already 13. Try, went normally at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the rocket occur again.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern ways was actually the damaged "Bulava."
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time the generality has defended itself against it and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without a fault, the management of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. Will carry 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defensive back Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps out his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to compete against Petersburg in Friday's duel KHL.
Fetisov, who graduated from his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured himself, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov as saying.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other teammates, fellow player Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe has played an entire season for Hartford at fifty-one years and was able to benefit from 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles and he has also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also accumulated successes in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
Due to frequently ordered overtime, the union announced on Monday the willingness to strike.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so it was on Saturday, the 19th. December, voluntary overtime suggested for reason that two work shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered the employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
The employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28. November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation method of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on 28. December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists, who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime hours for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced until last week to work 2 more hours virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness of the trade unions to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions are to come about on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said Wednesday that if they can agree on meeting the demands and sign a joint document, they would be ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, as approx. 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that employees must work the overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness proclamation that the employees, who had interrupted production the previous Wednesday, will not be subject to any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, unions are calling for overtime work to be kept to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding to pay out the fee of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Automobilfabrik Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production was started at the company in November last year.
Until this September, approx. 80,000 vehicles manufactured, the current manufacturing capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́steaded ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as strong an effect on conventional virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the composition of the medication can prolong the patient’s life and prevent the multiplication of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation has also led to the development sg. Resistent viruses result in which no more medicines are effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarborans act on the protein, which is responsible for propagating the HIV virus.
The metalocarbonatans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than any medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which were prepared for the virus protein based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding.
The metalocarbonatans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by the HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report, which was published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, which was published in the Wissenschaftszeitung Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of the cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the test tube, including its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the case of the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research directed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went after Fischer, he fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrific" and the government of Premier Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the prime minister as "strong sayings."
It is supposed to take time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas said the concept of the civil servant cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is concerned about his remaining in office with the help of the parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, but with Link Party amendments on more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for state civil servant salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the Social Democracy's proposals that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should grow with a backlog of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and Meaninglessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up to the Premier for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the trial of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominators of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government to what is in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit.
The Premier should also clearly state that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, for example those that affect sick pay and pensions, or the service law amendment.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, there are vice-run people who are committed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority, which is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is going to be current, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defense nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, Martin Bartak, told the journalists in parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council meeting in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Premier
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday, should the Premier explicitly ask the MPs of the Citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not act as orphans, we are not young children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back at the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about Bolshevization of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways terminated or restricted from 13. December some less busy fast and local trains, while other connections are being strengthened.
The entire volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the validity day of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and customer fares are not changed.
Several connection options to the capital, for example, are available to residents of the Ostrava area, the railway is using Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The railway is planning the largest reduction in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be lifted and the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
Passengers can use the Pendolino since 13. December no longer going to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railway: Increase by 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway will receive four billion crowns in order to settle the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just like this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they pay eight billion crowns next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, which is why it has not resorted to an increase in prices for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes only occur with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the stretch driven, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitantes today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
That's what the agency cited, the agency originally informed just over 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million people allegedly used the hostages as a live sign while fleeing police.
The local negotiators are now trying to hand over the remaining hostage.
According to the AFP agency, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the gun faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that prompted revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in Maguindanao province, the right of stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23. November, which was related to the election to the governor's office, was 30 journalists.
On suspicion of attending the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who resumed peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
Over the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods is coming to American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten," which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting actor role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the film's theatrical release, reactions from critics as well as the public will also be loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18. July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup are culminating, but at the same time the media is shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the lead roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get to the personality of Mandela and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every human being, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives in the course of the film to bring together two racial and since year and day mutually delimited population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also steps on the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which in South Africa is almost like a sacred act, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be full of bringing people together to a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving, that will only become apparent.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as for example in recent interview for LN the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The championship begins on 11. June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water foam and special extinguishing materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the management system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one, according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years nothing similar has happened with the company Ceps, mistakes of this species are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the line system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to the distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura is filing criminal charges for defamation against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is now filing criminal charges for defamation against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the firm's effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
All regions, however, ultimately signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, but we only made the offer about the scope as it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were completed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am of course ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear on this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail traffic and uses lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous move by the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and wants to continue it after New Year's.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on the initiative of regional railway transport with the Czech Railways and had not tendered for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by an MP of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we don't give up on the fact that we can lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free of charge and voluntary
Implementing pneumococci changes the usual from January.
She is said to be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But already, voices are reporting that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The Medicines Institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which on 2. August last year and were born later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further repetition vaccination themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be between 3 and 5. Life month of the child is given.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the professionals estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year on the vaccine doses.
However, you save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has for all the children's land vaccinations approx. 500,000 spent a year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infection, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children aged up to 10 years die in our hospitals per year after examination.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of the children against pneumococci was in approx. 40 countries introduced.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, this should be paid for by the insurance companies and voluntary.
The head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned, for example, that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association is already promoting the pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The professionals at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I believe that's the path we have to go now, Kalovsky pointed out.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment, we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairwoman of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is paid for as the first area vaccination by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is linked to a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MPs feared that the insurance companies could thus "run out of the money from the health insurance policy."
That's why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in 'museum theft'
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with trailers while inviting 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his depiction of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press news agency reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "that he was to enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The agency said Frank Frazetta Senior denied granting any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax hikes
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending freezes announced in the pre-egatation report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had let an opportunity "pass" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for the fact that he aimed at low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in Social Security and a 1 percent cut-off limit of public wage deals for 2011.
Social security annoyance
Unions have protested against the fact that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession they have not caused and have warned of imminent "problems."
The increase in Social Security - to about 3 billion British pounds a year - has angered the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect roughly 10 million workers.
FOCUS OF THE PRE-REVIEW
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses discarded
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 per year poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their target of deficit halving by 2013 meant "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the burdens of supplementary taxes would be accounted for by the 5% of top earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax hikes and spending freezes would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
“These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the period of the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by year-end.
Labour's predictions of future economic growth -- thereby affecting the scope of new debt and the speed of deficit-removal -- have been called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis," said the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was untenable.
They added that ministers have failed to put forward a credible plan on how they will pay this back and press "cynically" against difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They have said nothing of significance about what they will do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do so and they let them pass."
"The significant announcements will not be made until after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be saved from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit cap coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money, which will be won by the tax hikes and spending freezes, will be used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "built on sand."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that some at the time of the announcements -- like the above inflation adjustment on some disability pensions next April -- would expose the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the accusation of vote-catching, since the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Budget"
Although ministers have not disclosed any budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will not come to fruition until the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor's figures would mean vigorous smears in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It just shifts the pain to later," his leader Robert Chote said.
"The significant announcements will not be made until after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, a business adviser at accounting firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow advance budget report. The markets recognize that.”
FBI investigates 'arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Panjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was briefed on the arrests and was linked to the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, in case it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by one of the students' uncle.
He said local police had already been interested in the house earlier and that no charges have yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it declined Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradizing the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuses' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, it is still just as bad about human rights in Iran as it has in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, resulting in the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and accusers said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
'False confession'
Amnesty International cited the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They slapped me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... They threatened me with death and they humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also named the case of a former detainee who said he had been held in a container at a Kahrizak detention centre at 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election riots and the government's responses to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results won by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
On the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine for the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "It's some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks executed on the slope.
After Thursday night's event, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a construction ban on minarets and concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a sound and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularized societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Love Headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely arguing study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes now offering "Islamic open space" to the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it.
He's a good listener, he's reflecting debates between teachers and students about the questions that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen questioned are mostly at a stands with their Salafi counterparts – champions of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – which today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He hints that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "tightening of the screws of values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most bleak view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice she marks is melting at alarming speed, taking with it life that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Walked in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to sea, who fought only with his musket's rifle butt, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swaming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20's. Century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo facilities still typically own one millionth of the life area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became all green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, succumbing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to track down their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could unfold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20. For the first time, the turbulence of the pack ice gave an idea of the century.
Submarines measured the shifting ridges in the Cold War when entering.
A useful addition is satellite surveying and the large-scale application of measuring probes to icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look into the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater rinnsals that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, everyone is threatened by it when the summer ice cream once passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
The Upper Freed De'Angello Robinson traveled for seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have followed.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back from, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone was doing the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect like that.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered Saturday morning to put wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral rio manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also formed a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of the wreaths for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution on how we can support civilians our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave site.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had elderly graves from the 1st and 2. World War II and the Vietnam War as a destination, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held by the hand while wearing the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to adorn this section, but the bleak mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed and families and friends held on to each other in the icy air.
Some read out loud the names carved in stone, while others leaned down to small black-and-white place cards that had been put in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears outside her son's grave.
She has driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the burial site of Marine infrantry non-commissioned officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been in a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and for the World Bank.
U.S. advocacy officers in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was on 5. December was arrested.
The special charges have not yet been released, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the accusation of "endangerment."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities that include light protests and critical writings carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for a permit to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist administration in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by The New York Times.
The new U.S. policy puts great importance to the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in that direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are being used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press secretary for the U.S. interest group in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
One activity that would be legal in any other free society - the lending of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently produced a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Equal Cuba," a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants would very often be arrested, convicted and detained within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards each other for more willingness to engage in dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had sought an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he located them because one of them on the Internet video page YouTube had made approving comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service who was briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infer the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That's why they were rejected," said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were detained by Pakistani penal authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11. In September 2001, the U.S. Secret Service made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to special testing by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, because of their potential access to U.S. goals and their propaganda value, they are also considered tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest-ranking analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to inject someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate 'action' in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate action from the negotiators at the city's Bella convention center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event went relatively peacefully, though a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some downtown government buildings.
On a day when little happened at the UN-funded climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered the city with banners that read in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "Earth says "enough."
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother's birthplace, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country is struggling with due to the already noticeable impacts of climate change.
That's part of the motivations for why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named since he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing detonated several explosive devices near the main canal of Copenhagen, near which are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as luminous missiles but were then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin, saying: "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Exam data shows stubborn racial gap
The testimonies on mathematics performance were welcome good news for the Washington D public schools last week. C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country's schools, which produce peak performances, the testimonies show that the fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of its African-American peers rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders basically remained the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also non-emphasizing.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was captured in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown in this period, the difference has barely narrowed with 58 points now.
Some education supporters of the district last week expressed their concern that the results, those of school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were celebrated, for the most part by white students who are already high-performing children anyway, were driven forward.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, D.C. board member. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in Washington D. C. enters.
I'm not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points," said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we don't spend nearly the time and energy we would have to devote to our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and that lag significantly behind their classmates of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that brings games to lifelike experiences to the forefront from kindergarten to sixth grade, has been brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I mean we need to continue to work to let the best measures benefit students who are below grade levels, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for the low-performing schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who is examining city exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools that are located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could produce political after-effects that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements to close the performance divide is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to raise the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year on an agreement over 185 days a year, which he regards as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The coach reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered at Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the group's other eighth-graders exploring Gettysburg, where teaching costs 38,690 dollars a year, was more like that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yeah! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7, which the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the USA who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education that is necessary to ascend into the middle class.
In truth, one in five of those "second generation" of Hispano-Americans is closing down college - which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without having graduated from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they are pointing the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine high-performing children say these often have a natural affinity for school and a drive inherent in them to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if those efforts persist over an extended period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time," said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied Hispanic-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program, which had funded Graciela's college tour, is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP -- A gear-up -- and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue running until they've graduated high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Signs Contracts with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by Iraq's oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to account for shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European are leading the way, Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, told an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still underscored by massively coordinated bombardments on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military likely have kept American oil companies from doing so, according to analysts said, more engaging in Iraq, which owns the world's third-largest proven crude reserves.
U.S. companies were at a disadvantage in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could enter into contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have been at the side with technical advice in recent years, have gone blank.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said, that China is on track to become one of the greats of the global economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its co-bidders and fulfill its obligations to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for the bid levy submitted bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile strike along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials reported Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist agency this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs alleged to have been killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official from a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of being among the militants ran to the spot and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities could not confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading Al Qaeda military planner, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, noting a senior official who wished to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate character of the U.S. air strikes on Pakistani soil.
Accepting its central role as a given also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operation planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this by no means reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading U.N. envoy in Kabul will step down
The UN's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term that was tried by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Affidavits occur when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said it supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the build-up of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in Afghanistan's political change.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign from office, but only fulfilled an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN-
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun the search for a replacement, according to UN officials.
The UN representatives say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Oaths' position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had indicted him in September to favor President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive voter fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that the allegations made by Galbraith - which was fired - "undoubtedly caused harm to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the U.N. leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, saying that this would boost their confidence in their money being properly deployed.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan, saying the cumbersome U.N. cessation settlements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The U.N. rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have only been able to hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not continue like this.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for failing to participate in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about about. 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options to choose from in Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability of the war."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the American government joined top European politicians in the warning that Iran must face "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear security agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear program.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1. In October, Iran said it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and would forego a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have left negotiations on the preliminary agreements since that time -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran simply left the international community in terms of some proposals they had already agreed to in early October, has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way they never were in conjunction with key additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has the 31. Dec. set as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "suppressive sanctions."
In a statement delivered in New York, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "baseless and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and because of the division of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to lower American troop levels from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dispel Kurdish concern about the imminent troop withdrawal. U.S. officials quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, suddenly began to change course this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, spoiled single children affectionately called "little emperors," a population crisis in the country is drawing up.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, the UN-
Department of Population Issues, while the number of population groups of 60 years and older is expected to increase explosively from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent in 2020. This is far above the global average of approx. 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and the elderly accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of procreative age must have babies to "help lower the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial injunction introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical strain on natural country's resources could be avoided, whereas human rights advocates have condemned abuses in enforcing policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had gender-selective abortions performed, creating an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policies.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule --- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many tough slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Institute of Population Research, said that government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children who are a partner to be an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city government has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the Shanghai outdoor areas said an upswing is evident in the applications of couples who want a second child after the campaign launches, the city districts, by contrast, report no change.
At the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are received as an example per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births expected in the city expected for 2010 still at about ca. 165,000 will be -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai community's family planning committee Caolu, said that financial considerations were likely the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that they were legally permitted.
But they, like many Chinese, own only a minor government health and life insurance policy.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples state psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she only wanted a child because she was an only child, too. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with a double career, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it is about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of 20- to 39-year-olds grew up struggling their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space issue -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-funded climate conference -- which until now has been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- again set a focus on Friday with the release of a document that sets out an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he has been seen as important progress in a negotiation that is running out of time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a dedicated UN working group, is silent about the money supply rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be, which policymakers would support.
The trial is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate change representative, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture."
It shows the floor plan of a possible agreement in which the industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave the talks on Friday a boost from their assurances to provide US$3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from mastery of floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the conversations last week.
American climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not funded by industrialized nations.
That train announced that the Obama administration is running a tougher line with China than Bush administration officials not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign a deal without larger emerging economies standing up and taking action, according to Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued his statement an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement, which said it was either lacking "the sanity" of the leading American climate negotiator or it was "highly irresponsible" from him that he said earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China master global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake has opened up fault lines both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the salvation of the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive action to hold countries with very high greenhouse gas levy accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game of what a new economic dominance will develop from, according to Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say the talks will lead to a political deal at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states' offensive is "pushing political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and calling for measures from emerging markets, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most open questions need to be settled even before the arrival of government leaders to come to an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice-minister, escaped their planes and raced through the Bella Center's aisles to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The mere scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people enter and go out daily in the convention center, guitar-playing activists host nighttime shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think betray and sell, and contract drafts are passed on by hand instead of by email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the major ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the upper league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13, a pipe will permeate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will take place on its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras reach 225 km/h and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working journey times would be radically reduced and the change from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still pull the brakes on the British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will report on the 30th, according to the Times. Passing December.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which is intended to connect London with the West Midlands, will lead with a five-metre margin past urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also to create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The track would divide in or near Birmingham and a junction would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said one railroad insider.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to something over an hour today.
The designs offer trains the opportunity to run at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400-meter-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can go on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminus would be needed in London, where 20,000 travellers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the general election.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in north Birmingham, which would continue to put the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered a decisive sticking point, so that a change from the aircraft to the railway can be ensured, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pound orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservatives' leading lower house member, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he could build in his apartment building in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that lower house members must live "of lean rations," has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to get an oak-wood half-timbered annex to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Those in charge of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenditure of the lower house members. Last night, Duncan said the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest lower house members, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending control post of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a conservatory, which is referred to in the plans as an "orangerie."
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The committee acquitted him of breaking the regulations last month after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over 271,006 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan was refunded about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as a mortgage rate by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) a month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during that time, suggesting that the entire increase served to finance the cash borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to assert his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) a month this May.
Duncan lost his post as lower house opposition leader in September after an undercover reporter filmed him in the process when he said after the spending scandal that parliament members would live "of lean rations."
"In essence, when you work for the state, it means that you have to live on lean rations and be treated like s*****es."
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and would be entitled to a vanishingly small part, measured by what is heard.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this "could be seen as an exaggerated demand."
An activist has dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign as a protest in Duncan's lawn after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and then by Legg to increase value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasion and meandering or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is fully understandable and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of her believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that spurs to spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas carols as the theme.
The event started on 1. December and visitors were allowed to visit the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to the people in a post-Christian society again.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and host thrilling celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to call for an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed when a group of 300 protesters, dressed entirely in black, had smashed showcases with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police officers intervened immediately and without regard.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs," of these extremely violent splinter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in the east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction," and has underlined that about a hundred of them were "still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
Protesters have stopped about 500 yards from the building without trying to get in.
A stage has been installed to allow the designated speakers to be welcomed for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters have arrived with penances and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue raincoats, made a first casserole in the morning in Copenhagen, as you followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand reparation of ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached the environmental organizations.
José Bové, a member of the European Parliament, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the launch of the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets, according to organisers in Australia.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and hoisted bandanas where you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred protesters took place to demand an energetic approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "prank."
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as self-employed, Tbilisi denounced the "prank."
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetic area, another Georgian secessionist area recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Voter turnout was approximately 58% a few hours before the polling station close, according to the Abkhazan election commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia condemning the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his press secretary, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to the polling station, which was in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, to vote, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to supervise the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, in reference to the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will be recognized by the United Nations soon, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, and raised a glass of vodka in the process.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements that were made with Moscow the previous year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of voting must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, ready for action at any time, arrested about 700 people on the sidelines of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, according to the police, a hundred thousand have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by December 18 welcomes delegates from 193 countries, which are looking for an agreement to come into force on 1 January 2013.
From parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
Protesters have stopped about 500 metres from the centre and have not tried to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the designated speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed entirely in black and armed with bricks and hammers began to smash windows, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-riot police officers immediately encircled you and intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin by a paving stone during the incidents in which, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen explained, while the helicopters of the police circled in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," declared activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to ourselves anymore: We still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of opponents of globalization has approached environmental protection organizations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are located, which are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, approx. 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students dressed in red with bandanas, have made advertising for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350," particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge stronger from the school reform of the Lycéen.
The national education minister, Luc Chatel, explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects geography and history emerge stronger from the school reform of the Lycés, even if they in the terminal (12. School year) not compulsory teaching.
"The pupils of the Première (11. School year) now have all four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but by and large a concentration of "the best pupils."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He emphasized: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have expressed outrage at the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal on technical lycea."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) the state project of cancelling compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminale S (12. Criticize school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister, on the other hand, replied that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the Terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe will victimize the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they undergo a subject-specific aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and, at the end of the year, an admissions examination, during which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach even more hours that you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally declared that he would like to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he would like to abolish the school card "until 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change," had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure at Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions to the audience.
You want to do something to reach people and awaken in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of that day, on the sidelines of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty panelists were selected, even after their charisma," he clarifies.
"For global warming, you can talk for hours. However, the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who was about to meet the situation. 50 people only spoke freely with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he said, in the hope that the audience may learn that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be released from 15. December can be found online on the school page.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months after that.
Default of payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of the prison officials called on Friday for a general day of action to achieve that the premiums and overtime, whose pay was postponed for budget reasons until January, will be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2. The FO-Pénitentiaire ("FO-Pénitentiaire") union urged staff, who have no service, to demonstrate in front of the correctional facility on Tuesday morning and block them to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to."
The 3. CGT-Pénitentiaire called for "combining to a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surcharges incurred in October and the Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is being burned as "disgraceful and unacceptable."
The first union of correctional officers, the Autonomous Federal Penal Institution Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime in 2009 has risen sharply and not all were provided for in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent the unions of the prison officials a letter, in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functional and modernize it," the justice minister said in a statement.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime work, will not be repeated in the future," Ms. Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore meager, except for the management staff, which benefits from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional union FO in Marseille is outraged, announcing it will boycott "all gatherings and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, when then the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"At a time when we are being given more and more tasks without hiring more staff, trying to enrich themselves on the funds of staff is more than inappropriate," according to the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he's always giving Christmas better gifts than he himself gets.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has lashed out at TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he himself gets.
On a special broadcast that aired on Sunday night via the channel ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," affirms Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also get a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I gave you nice gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he invoked her mischievously, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you these?"
During this hour-long broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I understood that I had that ball from him."
The first lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle Obama recounted.
Johnny Hallyday has surgery again, RTL confirms that he has been put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for significant "injury" following surgery in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer has been put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors "damages as a result of the operation of a herniated disc" he had on 26. November in Paris had suffered, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages had required a renewed operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's final tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris, "no drainage whatsoever" was laid.
The rocker had surgery at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a herniated disc.
The procedure, which had been planned for several days, was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was of the view to RTL on Thursday that his friend was going straight through a "deep valley." However, he assured that you don't have to worry about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter."
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, that's not possible," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was "reacting well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained."
Mr. Camus also declared to have spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he felt no particular concern in the process.
Still, concern for the singer's health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general astonishment, there was talk that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colon cancer surgery," which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer struggled to move on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a new hospital.
Euro-2009/Short track: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while one had expected a real record flood.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at the international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in the present case I've said that if the world record is in my reach, I'll try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which started from 1. January 2010 are prohibited.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which first started in the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second-best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give my all this time.
I knew I couldn't achieve a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA : Grave plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was on Thursday to 1.5 million. US dollars estimated over their value, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It is from III. century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy tells AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she dived piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "heir of Emile Zola," which opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart."
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been foiled
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as incompatible after the latter rejected escort through the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place on the night, everything seems to be suggesting that there is disagreement on the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the aircraft provided by the Mexican government, which on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of the transfer M. Zelayas had arrived, returned to his starting point.
The coup government wanted M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and ask for political asylum abroad under escort.
However, the ousted president rejected this as he wished to return to Mexico as a welcoming, incumbent head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a renewed failure by trying to persuade me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," M said on Thursday. Zelaya told Radio Globo, in which he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has already lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly ten years, here I have my guitar, added the ousted president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, interior minister of the coup government, had told the Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only undertake as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of an exit M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the ousted president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around them, after which the local military had stepped up its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This, he said, revealed the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was on the 28th. June, on the day of the referendum he organized for the preparation of his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress, was overthrown.
He was out of his exile in Costa Rica on the 21st. Surprisingly returned in September and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves these, he will be jailed for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has succeeded, a presidential election on the 29. To organize November to M. Replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the disputed election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the expiration of his mandate on 27. January tuned.
Wall Street on the upswing, the U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance bear witness to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the market close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was written to 1,102.35 points at 0.58% (6.40 points).
There is good news from various economic sectors, judged Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is focused only on "half-full glasses," so she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixated on the figures from the American trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in October compared to September.
Analysts, by contrast, had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in the case of freight exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 inquiries.
However, the average of new job seekers has "fallen to the low point of the year" during the last four weeks, stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
Profitability of government bonds to 10 years has risen to 3,482% from the 3,432% on Tuesday evening, while the profitability of the bonds increased to 30 years to 4,492% from the previous evening's 4,408%.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle out "Ladies in White"
A few hundred partisans standing in Cuban power whistled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day on Thursday and also thwarted another rally, on the basis of which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
Around forty "ladies in white," wives or close political prisoners, were whistled on the open road by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were at the foot march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, confirmed a journalist of the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenary!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Living Fidel and Raul!" the empowered partisans chanted with a raised fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had taken place the night before in Havana, in which there were neither injured nor arrests.
In the Havanow district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also set off for the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily detained by plainclothes police officers, a reporter from the AFP confirmed.
According to this, the police have forced the journalists, the dissidents booed by the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles under the use of force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" have organized an unauthorised march for the purpose of "please for the release of all political prisoners", the number of which, according to the dissident list, has around 200 people, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 are behind bars to date.
Cuban authorities perceive the regime opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
One rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events taking place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane kills eighty-year-old with knife, leaving behind 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five other people on Friday at full-time business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information of the questioning, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a police syndicate in charge of the Alliance Police Department in the hospital, has succumbed to the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman buttoned up.
The man, roughly in the threesomes, has intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalized, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of his life, because according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who according to police appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on the spot Arnaud Pressé, a person in charge of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including teenagers, are said to have tried to tame the madman, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the threesome with a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter of an obvious bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on the boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, have tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stabbings, according to police information.
The action has taken place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by approached me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by lacerations.
Emergency services of the state police have finally arrested the man, who did not carry any identification documents with him.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has commissioned the district department of the Hauts-de Seine criminal police (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The maniac was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out that he is being sent to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it required six police officers to tame him at the police commissioner's office in Clichy, where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the crime."
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of the "Pianist," has denounced gross procedural errors in the second district of California in front of three judges of the Court of Appeal in 1977.
I'm calling for criminal relief on the spot, M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was charged with the case at the time of the trial, "let it run down your back cold."
According to him, the - now deceased - judge Rittenband, before he fell his judge's verdict, had discussed with a prosecutor, who is said to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison - which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the invoking prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will require the conduct of a trial that would allow him to submit the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the US in 1978, even before the proclamation of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't traveled to the U.S. since that time.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney General Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who is an opportunity to escape?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises its authority."
One of the three judges – who now has 90 days to announce their decision – even emphasized “that there are other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the cancellation of the criminal proceedings once again.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resurgence of the Affair Polanski, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was born on 26. September in Switzerland, arrested at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of an eventual extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the dollar's rise and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday, in a market that was torn between better than US-in-described indicators and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "helped improve the market view to the soundness of the economy's recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indexes were slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, thereby pushing ''down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,'" explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground as a result.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, up from 3.482%, and that of the 30-year bond to 4,497% compared with 4,492% of the previous day.
Miss World in South Africa again
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and this in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already got their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true swirl of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!," Miss Sierra Leone said with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (15 p.m. Central European time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't think of a nicer country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "stunning landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywoodstars.
It is, of course, every woman's dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this will be 59. Edition with music and dance underlined.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget, in a swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a leader of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an almost unbelievable warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairwoman of Miss World.
The contestants, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time tasted by bike and the local cuisine.
Quite extraordinary, however, was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a type of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never approach otherwise.
I will certainly come back to the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically promising Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news on Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday upon his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press on the exit from the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "as soon as possible" head to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, into which Johnny Hallyday went to Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection following surgery on a herniated disc on the 26th November was delivered in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to ease his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, into which he went on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after a herniated disc operation on the 26th. November was delivered in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at France's Los Angeles High School on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade is going to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The chief of the department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who gave the singer on 26. November at the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris, heavily burdened.
We were told that he had wreaked the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I've heard of the possibility of taking legal proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I personally spoke to this doctor on the phone, who assured me that he sees this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I myself already have two intervertebral disc surgery behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer would apparently have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist milieu.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant , operated on a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for unsuccessful operations and not to forget about tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples" who "regularly" has to answer to the board of directors and is "anything but recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux on Friday via his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, a statement.
This stated that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal."
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been rumming since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is for a continuation of the tour on 8. January (in Amiens) is a little too scarce, Mr Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou’s party MoDem, reacted violently on Friday to a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, on the part of the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him under threat of a judicial prosecution not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after handing the left.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To refocus his efforts, he had received the support of the deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now with NC), who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this trade mark at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and clearly stated that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and set the minister and the deputy under threat of a judicial prosecution a deadline to stop using this seal and to transfer the property rights of the trademark to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and the centrist alliance's senator Jean Arthuis.
You also probably believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, printed on your political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the UDF office stated, and urges the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette "demanded that the property rights of the trademark be transferred to their legal rights of claims."
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave these in 2007 to start a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
The party Nouveau centre therefore has, according to the undersigned, no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They further recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 passed the three-year accession to the party MoDem as well as the establishment of a branch in defense "of material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF" but of the UMP for three years.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF, to carry this out for himself.
Furthermore, you point out that this recklessness is in the best way to turn into a criminal offence, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for ourselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by, in a fraudulent way, to acquire a name, to which one has no legal claims whatsoever".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
The Court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to sneak some of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will turn himself in on 15 and 16. April 2010 have to answer for exploitation of weakness in court, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair, which is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter shred and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
Likewise, however, ranked the 15th Criminal chamber a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not in the conditions submitted during the investigation by the Nanterre prosecutor's office.
Doctors appointed on Friday are due to attend before the 10th. In March 2010, you will provide a report clearly showing whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her, explained Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to steal gifts totaling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to consider the admissibility of the lawsuit launched by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoys led to a major family debacle on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has invoked three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Baniers for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage.”
The Nanterre prosecutor's office is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor's representative, affirmed.
The court has now decided to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of managing large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies opposite the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" to impose the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately impose factors of customer preferences again regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the top of a much larger phenomenon that touches employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative effect on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D, which is even more crucial, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (E intelligence) demands "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a future-oriented view"; it claims a commitment from the employees, to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we call for a corporate revolution that would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company’s concerns on an equal footing alongside customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to his wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I could tell that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the entire structure finally comes to do this... what it always has.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power- proportional to the importance of its own failures increases.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Emerging from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "lever" (sic) on the commitment of employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos encourages the executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambition and their projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that, through their perceived image of the company, allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the executives of the companies can control their "social performance", predict and anticipate and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile ground that is favorable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama the night before in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the allocation of the prize to Obama on 9. October had mocked, this time applauded the president's speech, following the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her just-published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush has inherited, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo sought to justify the use of force; a way of declaring his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, rejoiced the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, this speech was considered entirely historic, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The previous lawmaker, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush, and now editor at The Washington Post, has given Obama "a very American speech."
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he has "spoken like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for whose protection they don't do much," according to Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced right-wingers, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk, described the speech on the National Review Online's website as "boring, lofty and inspirationless."
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is alarmed by how Barack Obama defends the rescuring of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praised by the president's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, referred to the address itself for a speaker like him known for his talent as a "monumental work."
The speech in Oslo "provides a schedule to govern international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily said enthusiastically.
The New York Times is of the view that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "bleak and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for a deal that secures supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the looming heavy supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was not signed until 18:00.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," according to Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we're starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some recalcitrants who are not satisfied with the settlement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the workers," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on this about "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the total trade in road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, in particular, to be addressed 13. To address monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall in taxes on employers in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law of the corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organization and that it will subsequently apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in no time," Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to kill the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens to "shovel a large grave for small and medium-sized companies in the industry in the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, France's largest high-speed rail network for the greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a gathering on Friday, the 2nd. Strike day between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), which makes strikers wait further with their demands for wage surcharges.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and only one of four trains outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travelers to change trains.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making an effort to connect the big stores in terms of traffic."
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated at rush hour, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no crowding on the platforms, as the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), declared that he would have gotten up extra "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the travellers by staff and law enforcement personnel, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "sleek" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
That's not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-due wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself is putting its wage surcharge proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership is "not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday's "comprehensive examination of working conditions."
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership who to date rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming down of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an advance notice from Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that immediately followed angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously more difficult, which is striving to extend the hand of the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Hasim Kiliç Constitutional Court told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity that Türk and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed proceedings initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is seen by Ankara and numerous other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers are of the view that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court sparks the government in between, which seeks to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to let the support of the PKK by the Kurds dry up and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a re-eruption of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the premises of the DTP in the multimillion-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement deployed tear gas grenades and water cannons as the protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision will "deepen the despair even further."
"Turkey can do this (Kurdish, ed. Editorial) Question not to clarify on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
That doesn't solve the problems," according to Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government," according to political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"You can obviously prepare for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks of the past few months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the weekend, it could be for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles stand ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows nationwide in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes with large scattering vehicles are driven off, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main traffic and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire service accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES's service begins at three in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better adhered to.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, it is the turn of the feeder and access roads, which also include the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side streets.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the footy people of the FES set out on the way, danger points and crossings are primarily cleared.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on these quickly, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-tall animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
Yet Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits, report Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea at the equator at the time.
Tawa is opening a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
He shows us much about the kinship relations, the spread and the features of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a dig at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones the researchers quickly identified as a new species.
Over the course of the excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun God of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually you only find individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primal dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long necks" and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischa (bird basin dinosaurs), for example
After analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as supercontinent Pangaea.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot derive from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could emerge, because in South America, a particularly large number of primitive dino fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant land vertebrae of the Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying dinosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic died out.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flower, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then had a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto are on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers of Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation prompted by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers on an educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The property damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The eviction constituted an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers are calling for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi state youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU state parliament member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (left) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been vacated.
The left has tabled a motion calling on the interior minister to give reports on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a tightly guarded site in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality, with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt-based science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed Planning Department Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus for a seminar will travel to Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ are enabled to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to get jobs in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart brake pad
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe."
Right like that. S21 is much more than lowering a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into helpless construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that end up in the middle of the city were considered to be traffic-related fossils of the 19th. Century, which seemed like brake pads of a modern rail traffic, since it once took an enormous amount of time to rescute locomotives from back to front.
Drive in, keep short, keep driving - that's how it should go.
And that's why the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station that is located about halfway on the trans-European rail magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan from the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian city to implement the lowering.
However, head stations no longer have an entry and exit problem since modern reversible trains with trains and control cars are available at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the new ICE line to Ulm is now being tackled.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway participates, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic bear taxpayers and not the state corporation.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be reasonably justified.
New urban space is emerging, which - believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The through station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger traffic, to which - typical 80s - huge growth is attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of sharp gradients.
What is even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
What is certain is that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other hubs and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at slow motion.
It would be urgent to press the tube properly.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley Route is becoming a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government to consider ruling on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally examined, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing on that day that the country had to reorganize the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway in Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the state government envisages, is not to be agreed with the legally required protection of the population from nighttime aircraft noise.
The coalition must go until 4. January decides whether to appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election on a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "break in words".
It's damn hard to keep your word," Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government tries to come with "legal twisting and trickery" to their night flights.
A close legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally compliant decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, his group’s statements on the night flight ban were never.
US banks repay aid
The crisis-ridden U.S. major banks strip their state-run shackles.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid the aid from the bank bailout fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And Citigroup is also planning to refund state aid, according to a report by US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have come with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised a good 19 billion dollars of fresh cash from investors over convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The cash injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had stood out at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Fast choice
Everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the acting editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the panel was about to vote on the staffing.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin, was considered a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, so as not to pre-empt the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage the ZDF director Markus Schächter, should this proposal also not come through with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out in favour of Brender, with seven voting against him. Brender's deselection was a bitter defeat for shatters, but an expectable one.
The majority of the Union on the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized.
With the argument that under Brender, the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost ratings, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Most recently, even 35 state law experts had interfered in the debate, which considered Koch’s actions to be unconstitutional.
It was of no use.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4. Born in Bingen in August 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
Afterwards he worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal."
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the deselection of Brender, who was still voted Journalist of the Year by the industry newspaper Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that the countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that personnel proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a smart move - by heavily criticizing the panel for it immediately after the Brender deselection.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter without loss of face could nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief and choose the Board of Directors without being suspected of taking office with a party-goer.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already attributed to the left-liberals.
Study is decluttered
Partial success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally stepped in on Thursday: At a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Higher Education and Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions in bachelor's and master's.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burdens: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" should be guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor's and master's degree programs more flexible.
There should be no different country regulations beyond that.
Fewer exams
Since the start of student protests in June, culture ministers and university principals have been wearing the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to drastically reduce the number of exams in part: "Each module usually concludes with only one exam," according to a 30-page paper, which is to partially re-regulate the admission of study programs.
With the "significant reduction in the audit burden," declared the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "misdevelopment should be stopped, which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" whether "unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of
Events" would be avoided.
The students had "claim to obtain leeway that enable and promote initiative."
The rules should apply when admitting new, but also in the review of existing study programmes.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – but this means that it will take until 2015 for all study programmes to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
The ministers of culture had urged the countries in October "emphatically" to act on the agencies in such a way that the abundance of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities should primarily set up tutor programs and strengthen study advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The state and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring an amendment to the Higher Education Act into parliament.
After this, only a single exam should be necessary for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies is to become more flexible, in addition, the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities is to be guaranteed and access to the master's degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all study programmes in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
The government and opposition had again argued over study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso Higher Education Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "have a say" as those affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Bonn-based decisions did not go far enough for the trade union Education and Science (GEW): it calls for a legal entitlement that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that sufficient master's degree places with the best possible study conditions will be available for today's generation of bachelor's students tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
To enter into Germany and from is beautiful is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident in disturbing fragments of language, who has won freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused a considerable extra-literary sensation last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distortion mirror of their securitate acts".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement in front of Romanian-German writer colleagues, among others. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have started creepingly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "so someone who has not resisted enough attempts at intimidation of the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and the vileness of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after Söllner’s confession of the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He had "slapped him out" in all the points that was difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Germany was a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may assume, are speculated and in some cases have probably also known which clear name was behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the now very procedurally reliable review of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic enlightenment has been sworn and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Reappraisal of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) of the Birthler authority was only founded in 1999, but the release of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, showed an interview in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar expressed disreputable about the laureate.
She had psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought that it could express itself blatantly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the Söllner case, as is so often the case in connection with concealed guilt, is subject to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The prudent reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a neatly dressed salesman was coming from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed goodies when the new VfB coach Christian Gross climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier. ̈
The man with the distinctive baldness was chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game, after all, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old was neither.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work just goes on.
Or really go.
In the words of the Swiss, who had only been committed three days earlier: "We have reached the round of 16", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against relegation."
The "much more important task" is imminent on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat the king-class performance in everyday league life in Mainz.
And to put off the weaknesses again revealed after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League round of 16 (first leg 16./17. + 23/24 February/ Re-games 9./10. + 16./17. March) turns 18. December in Nyon.
So the joy of the brilliant debut of the Babbel successor remained subdued.
Not only with the supposed bringer of salvation, who had conveyed the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths, and encouraged them to be bolder, Seelenklempner Gross explained the so simple-sounding recipe for success, which under therapist Babbel had no effect.
He has sparked some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury time, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his momentum, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new supervisor: "He is a man who reaches through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it had obviously lacked that.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were wary of overestimating the victory against a substitute-weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the bad awakening, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although a goal for the season was achieved, the other was still in the distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt on his 40. Birthday even after the first home victory in three months was not to celebrate, was due to the events of the weekend, which were fresh in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches under pressure from pubescent fans.
Also, that his free day after games had been cancelled, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "shaped by pure selfishness," Heldt wedged back, announcing consequences for the closing man.
I guess you're not going to be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching staff, the playfully and combatively strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a big share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Cup fight in heavyweight
Heated duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old champion, after version of the WBC association, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on the night of Saturday in Bern.
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout everyone was expecting.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to admit defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to be in the 24. Fight to accept the first defeat.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-meter-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left-hand leadership hand.
The eleven-centimeter-taller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly evaded the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some fuss before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
On Friday, the champion was provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11. October 2008 victorious.
After almost four years of time off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "reclaimed his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to hand over without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the USA in September.
I only got one blow in this fight and I am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The Bine David Haye, however, wears the belt of the WBA, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had earlier cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September in the summer.
His promotion company is now reportedly planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greens parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the airstrike by Kunduz, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of a deliberate deception.
The minister had said to the deadly bombing on two tanker trucks of September "knowingly the untruth," said Greens parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called it: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in defiance of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but also about deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured, according to the Nato investigation report.
Greens, SPD and Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately speak before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and, whether the chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not influence concrete deployments of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also become raised about the ministry's presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank truck stop.
Officially, it had said they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was said that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a fielder report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received a response, they say.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday, pointing out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag's investigative committee, which plans to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in an alert state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug frenzy, the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to indulge in the wildest ideas and fantasy images uninhibited.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in wakefulness, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or addicted to drugs in the modern Western world, at least as a strange.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of the mentally ill or in the drug frenzy.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dream-like changed waking consciousness states can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Even if the trigger and effect may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapturizing states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain's neural messengers - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very frequently during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of being insane with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensory illusions of such".
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats at the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted faces, teeth-scrambling.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables from the stereo, knots them into a sling and attaches them to a hook to the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The sling is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson to you, shouting the voices in drum fur-tight choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, for depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The mirages are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric hospitals it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution delusions.
Especially common is listening to voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The sufferer is unable to separate important things from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
Reality perception in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he becomes, similar to the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the mirages are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, says Fuchs, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis is basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
States of emergency can cause anyone to briefly lose their reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the trigger for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are running hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether mirages are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and illusions for ten years, last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Minds".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychoses, but also of an astonishing number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often also include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They occur when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brains are running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulus deprivation, stress, lovesickness or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a lanky boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other mirages are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are usually scary
Often the mirages are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new classmate, while he explains mathematical equations for everyone else, as he hears and visibly on the board.
At night, the appearances are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees, the faces or the girl with the bleeding lacerations on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she'll yell at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them about it, they would think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the high school diploma last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows full well that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus deprivation, they are likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then underemployed and provides for its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls dad since she can think is not her biological father.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between mirages and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they look so real."
Even nightly dream pictures, Kasten sees as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are no different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their mirages as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our too much-minded world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positives, creative - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of trauma-like changed waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking condition even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in traumatic or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients, who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning-making and meaning in a situation that is unbearable in itself, which enables us people to have their own creative ability not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant, while his body is condemned to lack of movement in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
Is abducted by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined happening, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel are still clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience transcends the horizons of our other life-worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug frenzy show how brittle our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children are to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new head of publishing, Kallen, is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told DER SPIEGEL.
We have set out the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You cannot put 7500 employees in front of your children if they are not sufficiently empowered.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would retire from the board chairmanship from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury department was responsible for the company’s assets and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign countries, pressures and finances.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda expressed that even family businesses are not safe from doom: "This always affected families who were infected by a capital addiction that were completely speculated and thought that they could thus become the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He "never had world power dreams," according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is available to you now.
That, at least, is what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, who recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 at the shopping center in Callao, Madrid, where everything revolves around body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilatory treatment with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxing and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has these types of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session with the input of a personal password on a touchscreen, which is located opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions properly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to stop by the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments for regaining hair splendor, shine and health are offered to your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 in the morning until 22:00 in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that’s why it’s a good opportunity to copy the looks of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has selected an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only advise against this.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the Introduction of the Electric Car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements regarding mobility through the management, coordination, subsidization, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE is currently being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
Electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and has a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of calm' for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm."
At the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled once again the measures that the government has launched in support of the automotive sector over the course of the year of government.
"Without the plan to compete with the auto industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," the president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of carmakers to continue producing in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided 800 million euros for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn accounted for investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in reference to the 2000E plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government , this plan allows the exhaust gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classical Automobile Fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, christened i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All of these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
When looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably by car first.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearshift.
This engine is a real pleasure. He stands out for its subtlety, through its quiet noise, its performances and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in gear shifting and its low consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model, which is selected for the test drive, is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The series equipment primarily features the lane change assistant (RVM), which thus abolishes the blind spot, but also the control elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth tooth and the chromed 17-inch
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not cover many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the test-produced model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, beamed more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a way to see certain attachments or to be able to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it voted Time magazine one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone's flat rate.
After the company saw the success with it, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a coffee shop with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe almost always went unnoticed.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it's always amazing that it's called Fon, even though it doesn't have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariff, means that the phone providers have to slowly but surely rethink and start considering various ways they can deploy their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices the download of books and other requests is included on the Internet.
Without contract and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay once, namely when you buy, and not month after month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a possibility to buy with lifetime Internet access, as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American first lady.
Already at the time Barack Obama took office as president of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to that she wore somewhat large-scale embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at the first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ very much in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo, one of patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-height heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: The hair was put up as a hair ring on this occasion, on the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have experienced problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the job market limited due to their motherhood.
The study discloses that there are vast differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they are practicing.
Those of them who do not do another job outside the house, only work half-day or do not have a fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving in together, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have come together and who have only realized the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of willingness to receive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they have only the secondary school leaving certificate or a higher education, became mother for the first time, on average, with 25.1 or 32.1.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with a main degree marry before their first permanent position and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree make it the other way around and first find a permanent position and marry after it and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envious list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (acting colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they had all appeared.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three-βx X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearsome genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a similarity to the fervent heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
In addition to the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual instinct, just as I have always felt without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the ominous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was so captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions united with the pleasure of remorse because of adultery, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the detour of destruction."
James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 peaks in the world's literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountaineers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird owl.
He sometimes said of himself that he would be the heir of a county's landowner and again other times he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified to a certain size.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry that was shouted out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo deep into the night of the 20. century echoed in his literary way. This he did on a journey in which he fled from himself and begged posterity with a speech full of violence in front of the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, my revered God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after a rich life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depression with her.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
Not a single other case is known where the man has had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do besides destroy the glory of that man, so that he can put himself on this podium?"
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid, which we brought out of the shelter and which weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they gave him two kicks and seriously injured him.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation attack that a woman who walked comfortably when she wanted to rebuke these people due to the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and in order to prevent possible prejudices from the beginning, we would only like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation of what happened prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, to an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "involves far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming safer and safer with each passing day" and further affirmed that, even with other actions of educational and informative character, they are helping to get one step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin emphasized that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, it is always committed to the fact that one of its main goals must be the development of increasingly safe products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the car market for vans is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are thus the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturers association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are of November 2008, which was a particularly poor year of sale with a decrease of 60% in respect of the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, the same thunderclouds in the sky that affect the demand most are still, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which make the purchase with third-party financing in almost 100% of all cases.
Thus, with these restrictions, which are the result of the turned-on money tap of the credit institutions, one must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support in the purchase of a vehicle of the 2000E plan has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission, which may not exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to also pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (lorry and bus).
The car dealers association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the previous year, for which it expects a sales failure (in the case of passenger cars and SUVs) of 19%.
Support in braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the anti-lock braking system ABS and how it is happening now with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period until the end of February 2011 was set.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end collisions because of their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical braking maneuver, which the system recognizes on the basis of the brake strength on the brake pedal carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even get around to pedaling on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, engages the brake system with maximum force and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that one in four accidents with personal injury could be prevented - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it would become necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already unavoidable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to bring the rescue plan for Opel to a close.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected side to give their approval of every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has backing from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more support.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
In order to achieve such a thing, they first dispensed with the automatic fold-out roof, which was replaced by a tent canopy with manual drive, so that 21 kilos was saved alone; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15 disappeared; by removing the air conditioning system again 13; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus another 7 kilosInch rims saved five again.
Then, by eliminating the audio system CDR-30, they had again reached six kilos less and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the dual-clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the grade impeccable.
However, the reduction in his weight has by no means meant that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives you a feeling of great safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he's told. The car does everything we indicate to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering system, which is just as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
One motor sound for all flavors
The sound of its V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it even more with the 'sport' option and with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether from a standstill or as they accelerate again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that's despite the fact that we found ice cream in the morning at some of these curves at dawn and roll split.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable lane, as it is otherwise rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and a casual starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiffness of her neck as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "bag girl."
The Baskonia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outlandish players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who sat down to the top on the scoreboard from the start.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it could already be guessed that they had come on the pitch with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava opted for an internal game from Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to continue to expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage at the break, the game was far from decided and the Makkabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellows" turning the helm (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the scoreboard again calming distance of (54-67) was displayed, which the host at the end of the third quarter with (57-67)
The Alaveses were put on the record in the final quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Even so, and although Splitter was put off the pitch because of fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being foreheaded
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to cede the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that in a game marked by the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially at the inside game, which made the Greeks' victory easier.
The team from Malaga was neither afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their performance in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts by 12-18 in the 9th. Minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the unicaja, even if the local squad managed with an internal match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis that the scoreboard in the 13th. Minute 22-20 in their favor indicated the minute in which there was almost a brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to finally warm up and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the retirement of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez leave clear marks on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inside and Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th. Minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which was superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to make the difference of the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th. Make up for the minute, which in turn swayed the lead within the group.
Unicaja tried to override the many failures and the elimination of the injured during the game Scotsman Robert Archibald.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja came in 31. Minute thanks to the lead and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis again some hope of 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be slowed down.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic made it in the 37th. Minute, to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give in defeat and had to step down the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your profile in Facebook?
Facebook users can now get their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of properties, job offers and cars in Spain, that they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers, which are available at Trovit in Spain. Users have access to a form in Facebook that can enter their profession, work experience, age, and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker feels "paid poorly on average," the person in charge of the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, explains in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through his search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros annually net; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most wanted jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day positions and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The president removed from office must the diplomatic representation no later than 27. January 2010 abandoned when his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the Brazilian Embassy's trade delegate in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he's the message he's been in since 21. September had found asylum, must have left.
"He is aware that he will be on 27. January has to go, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline set: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29. November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged victorious) Zelaya assured that he will remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed because of Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician whom the “de facto” government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you! Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to pay the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to leave liquidity free rein in interest, which is around zero, so that the banks buy assets for billing.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, are beginning to sprinkle some sand into the gears, as the BCE already pretended with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
That's why investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we're just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The fugitiveness of the exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and government debt is rising again.
One is now relying on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone in terms of Germany.
Spain has barely been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened a new revision down with regard to Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those in charge of world economic policy for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects of restricting credit to the loss of jobs, when they were supposed to have agreed a new day to express their thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has been foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government that is pulling together.
Prodi made it to Durão Barroso in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary will rescue Hungary from non-fulfillment of its foreign payments earlier this year and thus grant a euro member country not to meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account in the need for occasional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauches to too high amounts, that would now be within what is expected.
In the case of Spain, one does not have to worry, as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
That from Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the early indicators here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are again coming with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long lifespan despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "beware of driving" is needed.
Connected branches
Iberdrola's chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some bullet points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from this date by 2030, under the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this is not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the question will change and one should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to collect carbon dioxide and, of course, above all renewable energy.
In this case, he expects that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the conditional by other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, by no means wanted to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all the policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, one clearly sits on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Be it as it may, Galán thinks, that the decisions on investment should already be made now, even if they are long-term, since it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle it.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swiss-speaking Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is set to last five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol yesterday to cooperate to create an innovation center for smart infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be the investigation of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for his first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction, which is involved, is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city government would like to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had opted for a public-private collaboration (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll disposal.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortiums, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other in the last phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is shortlisted, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction work and privatizations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that the companies mentioned have followed Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% interest in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry, in which it is already very well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Under further assets, it already has its largest windmill farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies tasked with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, which will be sponsored by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Northern Feeder), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels. This is the biggest measure of congestion reduction on Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll route is already scheduled to open to traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex venting system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia is awarding considerable orders to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The sub-company ACS will use its domestic subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the 27-storey construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for this.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has obtained the construction of a tunnel over a length of 2.1 kilometers for a highway in Slovenia through its subsidiary Alpine, the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract just a few days after it was awarded the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine enhances its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore attributed over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
This contract also offers the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented to this competition advertised by Renfe, 4 of which entered the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the past three years.
From now on, Sra will. Rushmore are tasked with the design and manufacture of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the break-up of the competition.
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a penalty of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landline and mobile phone by means of the signing of exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprise has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The punishment imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that watches over the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase the revenue from transactions that do not originate from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has earned Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
The Champions League has become a source of income for the football clubs since its creation in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, earning them the third and fifth places of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning UEFA's Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since their inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is third in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and, alongside AC Milan, the only one that has won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup finishes fifth.
The list is tops Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also raised the most money through their participation in the past Champions League.
Even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that could take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four in Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated cash allocation procedure that UEFA applies.
In this fiscal year, the organization, whose chairman Michel Platini holds, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA envisages 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the qualifying preliminary round (among them the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation got 3.8 million through their blous presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the eighth final will each receive three million; the four who have reached the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four will each get 4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated places.
Last year's Master receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-placed and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details of the offer to buy shares yesterday, with which it intends to acquire a cap of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which are paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it has not been informed of this offer, although the company reiterated Ruiz Mateos that it had been in contact with the authority.
With a deal, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In the attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the judicial quarrels of his ex-managers, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal audit.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to hold a high post at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly subordinate to the chairman of the group.
This is far from free of polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the course of the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar's loan, the ex-advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their provision.
CNMV approves Paternina's public invitation to issue a public invitation to issue by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on the past 9. October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proven that the conditions adhere to the final laws and thus the content of the presented explanatory supplement, after the amendments of the previous 2. December, can be considered "sufficient."
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 euros in shares authorised on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, it was also informed that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which can not be transferred in any way until the tender is completed and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the final laws.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of severe weather and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage incurred and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the reviewers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to work on them afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are prepared with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for review and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work together, with each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming ever larger, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
Once a new car hits the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because every single of the thousand-thousand-metre vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In view of the vehicle fleet travelling on the road, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and manufacturing databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each and every one of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax through a guide who informs about the value of used cars.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, it’s easy to get an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Except for the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for, depending on the intended use, i.e. for each expert opinion.
The most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of expert opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran off the assembly line solely on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service for the specialist market on the Internet, with which you can offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis, or obtaining information about the deviations by make and model.
One can thus examine, for example, how many models of a certain car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which in 1971 was developed as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and injuries. Maintenance of vehicles was established.
The GT guide for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased annually in the last three years with 20% and in 2008 the turnover was 10.8 million euros.
Early last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
Total revenue in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In Germany, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicle and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value appreciation to its customers, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, junkyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers these days.
Every day, 3,000 advertisements are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be registered again, even if they have been deregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and preparation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and after that he can have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customer.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for appraisal such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not involve estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and and then completely turn the picture around to look at the inside.
