A Republican strategy to oppose Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by affirming that voter fraud in the U.S. is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in 10 years in the U.S., by the way.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding elections in each state.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 that complicate the procedure for registration or ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, the right to register as a voter on election day is declared invalid, and the right to vote for citizens, for which a court file is available, is denied.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state has required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens own, i.e. 21 million persons entitled to vote not a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such ID in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to get the required ID.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who are increasingly casting their votes for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no federal state has required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispane voters who prefer democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers promoted legislation in eight states abolishing the registration of voters on Election Day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These limitations are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004 contributed to this, approx. 10 million register citizens.
This is because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
Also, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, though they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of voters, made up just 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The attorney general of the U.S. has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
The Democratic critics denounce the partisan political nature of the laws passed and see them as a clear goal to influence the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes exhibits erroneous results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for the conduct of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were numerous disturbing factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years if you have a direct relative who has already developed prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made really understandable about the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases one is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, no treatment is taking place in many men who have been diagnosed with cancer, as their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are suggested to active monitoring and are offered treatment as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, one determines the criteria for a decision on who should be treated and who should not.
Therefore, I still recommend carrying out the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In collaboration with the international Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%," emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages people's health.
“Today there are still 1.5 million in Quebec. Smokers," regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of cancer to die decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, grim, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against grim cancer," he adds.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of a wrath or grim. colon cancer to become ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-load.
“Executing an early detection test does not lead to cancer.”
The Higgs boson analysed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a certain stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it's not yet entirely certain that it's really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of any doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but data is still missing to be completely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it is actually the Higgs, because there seems to be a small risk of being mistaken, and let’s look at what it is about.
There is an inevitably inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present simultaneously in the same place.
It's not possible to violate this rule - and don't try too hard as you'll hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Paulian exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state," whereby this "state" consists broadly of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and like to obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, a foul band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing) are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
However, it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic power.
Namely, if a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at exactly that location, roughly like a pebble that has been thrown into a pond.
This “disturbance” creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons “carriers of force”.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to show.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is, in fact, not all the particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the fridge by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not have mass.
What can all this research now be "good," Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely examine all the discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who longingly hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great deficiencies, since it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is approx. 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first continuous wave laser himself in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was viewed rather than a "laboratory gimmick" in the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the LHC's activities will inevitably change our lives, but it means you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its committee on "dying with dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important subject area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a two-year deadline.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating herself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped with the food.
He bravely manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humbling," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"That depends on the person's ability," he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer showered with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation."
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before accepting that you put on a mask that will help her breathe.
She is still expecting one last visit from her son, who is from Italy, in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you offer with a group of volunteer body care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
This is where life continues under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is granted oral care with brandy or pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died over the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, not a day is like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years old, who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while toasting in his honor, a young man of 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45," Dr. Christiane Martel is worried about.
53% of the patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is supposed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the society for home palliative care in the greater Montreal area, are more or less specializing exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that ensures that several physicians specialized in palliative care are looking forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concern.
A manifesto has been circulating since the month of October, which is committed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to express her opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. According to Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting to passing over to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any action to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst prognosises until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she recounted.
She told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not allowing this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in euthanizing the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the road construction office, companies of the construction industry, fundraising political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is disintegrating since you took drastic measures," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a lawmaker in Quebec and a former head of Montreal's police force.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation into the misappropriations related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he insists, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some curbed their instincts to maintain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping it will succeed in "pointing out the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops on auditors, government officials and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau force", which since 2009 has caused the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to proceed more cautiously in the artificial inflation of the contracts.
In recent weeks, she has made rows of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were specifically charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by having more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (ca. 68,000 euros) gave to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organised an illegal raising of funds for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials from the Road Construction Office have admitted they were lubricated by artificially inflating bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
Also, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a community property from 2010 onwards, which was acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation ultimately carried out, she says she is "drawing by a thread that allows to understand the workings of the system subverted by ants to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She says the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but would need an investigative unit intended only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, worry about the role of "mandate holders who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak slap of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which according to him would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about taking a look in their own backyard...
“PSG is not FC Barcelona!”
This season, you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress by her side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play on a daily basis.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's new additions are used to playing very high levels of games.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This causes a player like me to have to stand up and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my accomplishments.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the front-runner from us.
We're lurking in the ambush, though.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the quarter-finals in this way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have a say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the return leg of the quarter-finals as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project take concrete form.
Would it be a huge failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a huge disappointment.
This year it is really important to us to cut off this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to take the win away.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something to be accused of, that's certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what else people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the quarter-finals for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG appear to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances.
All the better that you speak of a "Zlatan dependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he's come and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was important to me to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from knocking out some game time.
I saw things there that I came out of strengthened.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does that put that on 16. October in Spain forced draw (1:1) a kick-off game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payment and selling without a bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system shaped by bank monopolies is leading to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchanges such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to 2 dollars five months later, before recovering to around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success,” “in competition with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to traditional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously the depository of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
In reality, every transaction between two users takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a kind of provisional central banker having the privilege of adding this extra line.
It is a dismemberment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "chopped up."
The goal is to find the number that yields a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without linking, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but are divisible to a hundred millionth, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important players such as Wikipedia refuse to make donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book, showing that almost 80% of Bitcoins are out of circulation.
A "mega-final sale" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are thereby cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat states, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are being reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB’s report envisages reassessing the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of the success of this currency.
We've moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but frequently also made up of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as they did at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with French loans, was duly carried out.
The truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more inflow of the Taliban in Kabul.
Conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the struggles of the various riotous groups.
Their seizure of power at the time was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by seizing land from the government to sell them as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus drawing benefits from the massive American award of subcontracts.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn't make up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who have been able to take advantage of the American grants: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command she will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already striving for the restoration of the militias in the province, which will evade the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization using the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which has existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign checks, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and has long been.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructures would have been required.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Mining is not possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export via the mountains.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's main employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to reestablish normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was made on the 20th. completed November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls' and boys' high schools, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and had it carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of reconciliating aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which numerous local workers were required, has been able to help suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very hard at these valleys, which are often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written inquiries from small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation of less, well-controlled and directly concerned civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A Constitution with the Crowbar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power of attorney, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly would pass its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been relying on a provisional, multi-amplified text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only made for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trespassing the right underfoot."
On the part of its proponents, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to refrain from their intention to explain the text section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to find his public and democratic legitimacy again while the protest is raging across the country.
After reaffirmations in an interview with the American newsree, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolent.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this resort to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away, as they believe that they have not been able to bring out their viewpoints.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles were mostly passed unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, since some members of the panel were of the opinion that the commute clock of the Constituent Assembly did not exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and to their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Shinesity" is reciprocated by the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place via other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, since "the persons who are asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see in this the first signs of a theocracy.”
Liberals' fears are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the present one.
“Currently, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," appeases Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have demanded.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text, which they consider to be threatening to be freedom.
The fact of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The head of state's proponents will march Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the world's navel and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF will give you the top five reasons for visiting Israel.
Bow before the holy sites
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all those who bathe in this river receive God's blessings.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the cessation of the sea tower and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Believers celebrate the path of suffering here or The Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The trail begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian conception, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple, which of the Romans in the year 70 n. Chr. was destroyed.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which then come true.
Take a trip up
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies, the Herod the Great in the year 25 n. Chr. had built for his family.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, where countless tourists are drawn during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea Scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures by the visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum and the Holocaust Museum, respectively Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, told of one of the most harrowing chapters of the story.
The most poignant department is the monument to the children, which was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
Israel’s three main recreation areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathing throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even non-swimmers easily carries on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm strained nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city ran the famous sea route, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The town is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda here, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, which are named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be, according to legend, all the hold that touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo shoots.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed nowadays.
Wishlist for tourists
When you go to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is rather not taken in any euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually make progress by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also an express tram and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper town.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including changing trains for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is dormant.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, marine products, fish without scales and food that contains both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with mettle and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-fed cats that stray comfortably and unmolested through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
Insurance costs an additional $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Entrance tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which is an increase of 51% compared to the comparable period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9. February 2011.
'The big and powerful' leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the upkeep of families remaining in the homeland.
On the 1. December came into force a law, according to which every migrant worker must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
It is necessary to take not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the receipt and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entirety of the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of the Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the rule of having to have language skills bring to both the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, counters spokespersons for the migration authority, it is about reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must already be protected before their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you are promised the one thing, and on arrival you are cheated, get their passports taken and do not receive the promised wages," confirms the head of the head of the head of the labour migration department of the Tajik Migration Agency, Tolib Swaripov.
Don't scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not master the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families, there isn't even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to be in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "Admission prohibited for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly forged and we are not registered, and from this then arises cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
“Just don’t shy away from costs for false papers”
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the migrants' registration documents can be fake.
Some fake certificates, which certify the completion of the language test, have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That's more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this one costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both public officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the moment, authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered positions in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in crime extremely low
Russia's Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the gun law for private gun owners.
Authorities are responding to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings, as well as seven killed in the rampage of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairwoman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that the amendments to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, the author of which - representatives of various arms associations - demanded from the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very small, the criminal lawyer, Vaily Lesnikov, told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with the application of the registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from using on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find every possible weapon for little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons enter the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, recounts a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a web page that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that were stolen from the police’s armory as well as directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons storage facilities.
Many military camps have frequently caused explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military member says.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore squander weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes craft production and a Mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market roughly.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there through the "culpability of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are due to thefts in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant for a gun shop, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations will no longer be buying anyone, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supply in a weapons store.
A weapon, for example a TT-type pistol, is purchased via an ensign.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crime, periodically carry out control purchases at dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales adviser adds.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find most often about acquaintances to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to me to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would be waiting for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only found out about the price of the gun there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," the sales consultant recounts. “I have such an acquaintance, but I don’t trust him.”
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and date with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who has stated that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I even come to some striking rings about an acquaintance I trust.
He also delivers the batting rings to me only because he knows that I don't rat him out.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album depicting "all sorts of things."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There are no papers needed nor are there any personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," reads the advertisement on the website "Buying a combat gun or rifle."
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Will it also be sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Ivan" (literal quote).
“Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless mock websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going to the service in the net.
People come like hungry fish while feeding and then end up in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the gun," reports the press secretary of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that at the end you can also go empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless mock websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going to the service in the net.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Macarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices of $100 to $900 are to be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarov-type pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons storage by middle-range supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
One in four American youths sit behind Mc Donald's cash register at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell even further or whether they will run out of air again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing nonprofits.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of forming unions.
So far, this industry of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the U.S. that attracted millions of customers, which at times led to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their jobs and, along with unions and left-wing activists, set out branches of the chain whose target groups are low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the marginally paid Walmart workers only shop at their own workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the US.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or handheld scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution for the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour could not afford that increase, they said.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's approx. 1.1% more than they now donate to pay.
If Walmart were to completely transfer the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Per year, that would be more spending of just $12.39 compared to today.
Walmart’s proponents are satisfied that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not cause the company any losses.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-leaning Huffington Post's website that in total "less than five" Walmart employees put down the work and the protest action had merely been "another PR trick" of the union organizing the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target, however, was not Walmart stores (which are not desired in this progressive city and therefore so far nonexistent), but McDonald's and other reasonably priced restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company is selling billions of portions, and yet you’re not being given sick days, and you’re not getting paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour under federal and New York legislation.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too much, and on average, their ordinary employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get by with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youth stood behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with McDonald's staff, I constantly encounter people who complain that they get along with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal’s forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began Thursday at 6.30 a.m. outside McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance doesn't make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
There were also loud protests that day in front of many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a gathering at noon outside the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you're not getting paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also backed by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food staff so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of whom are employed by far in the fast-food industry where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
“The brain can only be moderately outsmarted so far”
The popular theme of augmented reality among followers of modern technologies has recently been perceived by the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a through station for the scientists of the company.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck in the phase where pixels are used on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead to 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot of things still take place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all bystanders about their actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we were working on a project in which we experimented with short and scarce gestures instead of expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed control types, for example gestures and language.
- How?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give you this bubble box?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can't do at the time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new sensor types that will make it possible to capture reactions from people more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis must be taken into account.
The speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the present 30 fps are too few, especially for gestures.
In our Redmond laboratory, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Nice would be a flexible, Kinect-like system, where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of applying the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think this is the best option: The most amazing variant would be a "changing" extended reality, where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in it lies their strength (privates can only see), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is one problem that critics of this idea frequently point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She perceives pressure superbly!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently still as weak, as if someone was blowing over the palms.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, even that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outsmarted, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes working in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: on many topics, we are only just beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg Avantgarde" project dedicated to city dwellers who make up the avant-garde of art and culture.
The exquisite list has already included high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded in red, who you can sometimes meet at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and the 80s. early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, puts a smile on the face of his fellow citizens and provides them with a good mood.
He recently grabbed a revolving organ and became a Petersburg revolving organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the trade-off between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that differs from the grey norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Palace of Culture of Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end at that time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I befriended the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from this "Pushkinskaya 10" was created, and then it was over.
I am drawn to theatre, to fashion, to music, to actually to everything, except literature.
- And all of this was united in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creating artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of the Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovations.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wear tight jerseys and they included the composer Igor Vdowin, who is now trendy.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the Art clinic.
That's where our staff and regulars went.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the "Personalities of Our City" award.
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and with that I was at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, this all blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by requiring that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves to the outside and not to the interior of the human being.
But maybe you are not allowed to shake hands with a person, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
- We recently saw you in the role of the urban organ player. - A city of culture should have a hero like that.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- These days, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- To the performances of Stas Mikhailov come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons come 300 people and not 10 thousand, consequently there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what I have achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, which even hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a human being of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's the lack of Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
Yet not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real Tsars it was different, because the Tsars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked from the path, as it requires more high-ranking experts who correctly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not embrace all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's a lot less.
Art must be modern again, just like at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth's inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, is the important question of how we can reproduce in microgravity or on the replacement planet?
There are no many choices, in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus," says the research associate at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the question of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects embryo development.
It's developing a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find support; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid surface, the chicks rolled over wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely blunted off.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then set the whole thing up because it's just impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last incubator with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be located on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already sent fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been established.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved until now.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are ripped from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Still, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts where everything went well after long flights and they had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolab in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water to be pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness to the fact that life on land descended from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid for about 9 months in the mother's belly, and that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenowa.
So while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not get along without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles regress tremendously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze the child out also decreases.
Well, let's get around this through birth-introductory aids.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit like an adult in orbit for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the world that we will give birth to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person,” predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the inhabitants of the Earth in their spaceships set off to a distant planet that will become the home for their offspring born in space.
NKÚ chief: Control of the black system fails through debt of politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but is falling behind in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is stated by the Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is not the case in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called. "Black system" on.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with checks - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, hinder in its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in the context of which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Put simply, the point is that the European legislature determines how to handle public procurement. This is what national legislation is based on. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test is not yet complete, we have noticed extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a bit more "strict and perfect" for us, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to always draw up new and more precise rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What does this make of this project for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of the laws and the lowering and balance of thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even that in this way we burden the system only with excessive "paperwork," and those who seek gaps in the system, have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is structured in a similar way to ours and also has a college that is merely formed somewhat differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these audit offices also exist in the individual federal states - in this respect, the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the state accounting offices.
As for German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a role model in some respects, although it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the examiners are better?
Certainly not, but as I said: I do not like such comparisons very much.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a role model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to cooperate with our authority, would they?
As for Czech legislation, what significance did the amendment of the Procurement Act have for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our trials.
Since our checks take place retrospectively, a certain delay must be expected here.
So far, we are more likely to feel impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognizing risks of uneconomicality" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an effect, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the passage of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Even under the previous rules, the persons subjected to an examination are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the Procurement Act is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think it's that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system merely puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out of here?
First of all, let’s say which path is not expedient.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS did not provide the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called. "Schwarz-Systems" would bother - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must nevertheless have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come, and hinder the control office, whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, in its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say we're pretending to be nothing.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain processes - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
There is a few ice smoothness on the roads, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mostly easily navigable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easily passable this morning, occasionally there was snow and ice smoothness.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility because of fog.
The R6 expressway and the traffic routes of the first class of roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is required, for example, to bridges on which the roadways are sometimes icy and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third road class, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, iced or extended snow remains remain in sections.
Increased attention is therefore required, especially in the higher elevations.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads of East Bohemia there is danger because of ice smoothness, in higher altitudes and in the mountains on the roads there is sometimes still an extended snow layer, informs the road and highway directorate on its websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothness can occur in particular on traffic routes of the second and third road class in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or sunny today, and it remains largely rain-free.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are easily passable today, but there is increased attention locally, and the driving style is to be adapted to the weather.
This one is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can come to ice smoothness on the roads.
Locally, fog is also to be expected, but the visibility will improve in the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but increased attention is recommended by the road masters between the 80th and the 131st. Mileage.
The roadways of the first class of roads are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smoothness can occur in sections.
The roads of the second and third road classes are damp, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections also applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful, mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc district
Today, drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the district of Olomouc have to expect slush.
After the use of scattering vehicles, slush remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nocturnal snow drifts forced the road masters to use, in the district of Šumperk fell about 3 cm of fresh snow, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roadways are usually passable without restriction.
"In the district of Šumperk, there are still scraps of snow in the high altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect slush towards Jeseník," an employee of the Šumperk road administration told the agency ČTK today.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to come out at night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet up to the high altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are unrestrictedly passable, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, because the roadways are still damp here.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In Northern Bohemia, the road masters report several poorly navigable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower elevations, so snow and ice will keep on the roads. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Low Mountains, however, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
So far, no traffic disruptions have been reported.
Ice smoothness is particularly reported from the perimeter of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the daytime rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes, as well as from the road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec, poor traffic conditions are reported.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the end of the world is to take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re more fun of it and say that we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which for the 21st. December at 11:10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before, i.e. on 20. December, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally from me, afterwards we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We not only want to gather sufficient positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with the purchase of which via www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap together with other performers also has the so-called. Hymn against the end of the world titled "Doomsday is cancelled" recorded.
The anthem on YouTube is already very popular. Will she also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a direct circuit by Czech television.
The text of the hymn is by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us and enjoying it.
What purpose will the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
Within the framework of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, in which we will then move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you choose them by?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked out without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnessing that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible to disabled people. There, it is still unusual when someone is travelling alone in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course there that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still a lot of things we hang in afterwards...
In addition, however, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the effort of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks that things will really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now. But if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and among other things. Saxophone play, I founded a music group together with a colleague.
Well, and with time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, is a little out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; besides, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this cannot be seen on the outside, one’s own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and, etc.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is part of it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we would have to regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful to this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you are not allowed to compromise on many things and also have to demand a certain discipline.
This, in my opinion, is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have rehearsal twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm quickly extinguishes with many.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You can't prevent that.
Those who have the will and the desire to participate are always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9pm
Venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected via live circuit and a joint interpretation of the anthem "Weltngang falls out" of the band The Tap Tap is heard.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disability-friendly educational center, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to the 20th member of this space agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the European Space Agency's member countries. Poland is thus the second member state from the former Eastern Bloc (to the Czech Republic, which was held on the 12th). November 2008 became an ESA member).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s path into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts dealt with space travel, although they did not always understand.
I remember, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld of 6. December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905), however, left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP deer donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was recognized, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway drain was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the drain.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered projectiles.
The research work was conducted by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that the research had reached the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the trade press of Ing. Rohoziński's design of a photoelectric hunting rocket on, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work its work was terminated by the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, the first satellite technology projects were already in place, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was made on the 10th. October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The first rocket of the RM type was succeeded by the Meteor 1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed from this rocket (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor 1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the aviation institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worth mentioning is Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on nonprofit work.
This decision provoked a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wages) there are price tensions.
This term is understood to mean a condition in which the manufacturer tries to survive in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "undercutting" the competition in order to seize a larger market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily rises.
This situation is further compounded by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are supplying private capital to their own populations without regard to the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one’s own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by the curtailment of workers’ rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food dispensaries for the poor for several years, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as it did in the 19th). century was the case), or for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or the capital is completely absent, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This affects the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the point of excess that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its point of view that the state must not intervene in the economy in a steering manner.
But then one must ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual favouritism, legislation in which virtually everything is criminal but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, for lack of finances, commissions private, closely intertwined legal companies with the draft laws.
These bills are subsequently passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer proceeds from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are quickly getting into a situation at the moment, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar and Pompey's time: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, by unlawful creeping up of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption proliferated unrestrained, and the people went to the polls with votes already bought" ... “People with character did not apply for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline.” “One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected. Appian thought of Pompey, but the strongman was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole rule.
As it turns out, today’s society, as well as in antiquity, is founded on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is not inherently capable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least seeking deeper reforms.
We must therefore cause the advent of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20. Searching for century.
From today’s state of affairs, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, at which the next round is already emerging.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are in complete ignorance of the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnesses today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know it from older and modern history.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there was, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is the culprit and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; ultimately, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
I want to give readers a glimpse behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are primarily helpful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a story of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can make out an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit to ourselves that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out in particular, which could be described as the head of the octopus (I don't know if there is anyone else above them, but I do not rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already in the 1990s by the Rothschilds. Century bought to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare for them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the raid on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln declined to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after seeking to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The Rothschilds’ global desires for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge, in the years 1859 – 1871.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war in particular was intended to break Britain's colonial rule, and the third war is intended to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and luxury, and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism here is nothing more than the apron) and finally lead to the adoption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (or ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening the situation (see founding of the Fed so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire, the war was no longer necessary), then the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate the Second World War more easily, the bankers had politics create a latent conflict situation by placing Germany with gigantic war reparations; in this way, they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who named the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority.
End of the 19th The Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, if possible on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain to which the international bankers had initially kept him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany provided the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers will succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be victims in the front line of struggle, similar to the Second World War, in the front line of struggle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
You have to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, because the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, exclusively put their own candidates to the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone politician loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything possible to spark a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand into a global conflict, and in which it could quickly expand to a global conflict, and in which it could run because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide of the world's.
In what light appear the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
And it makes that the small and the great, the rich, and the poor, the free and the servants, all give themselves a mark on their right hand, or to their forehead, that no one may buy or sell, that he has the mark, namely, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has reason, consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it comes to the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, who had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a major blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at the hostage liberation only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked a wave of solidarity at home as well as anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran; in doing so, an extravagant story helped them to cover up their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited filming locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also made Hollywood's collaboration necessary.
In order for the camouflage to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in trade journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The movie draws on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several movie genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called one. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations either).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime novel No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film, which doesn't set in the director's native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the features that set this director's previous films off from the standard of Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the initial sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the little, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality somewhat - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artisted).
Argo's weakness is his overly broad dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some traction as a result. It is a film that you follow with some interest and the design and the one to a thriller from the 70. Years of reminiscent retro style can gout.
However, he is difficult to inspire enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in a certain way to this day and as proof of how excessive the ideas of the all-powerful and omniscient secret services are, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually issues a survey of the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to contest "Absurdest Regulation or idea from the EU workshop" to organize.
"The recent plan put forward by the EU brought us to this idea to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is concerned with the organisation of this survey, told the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for the insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the binding admixture of bioethanol to fuels, which is inherently damaging to the natural, and also the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous material, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which eggs became much more expensive this year.
Criticism also received in the past the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonised the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards regarding fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation from last year, which, according to balloons, must be provided with the indication when selling that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of children’s suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairgrounds.
Curious ideas also exist at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official function in the EU is not allowed to use the designation Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire alongside the above. Absurdities also the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that was allowed to be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we threatened a hefty fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will request a refund from the EU," declared then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that the grain harvest had been very high and the state camps as a result of the so-called. intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic to such an extent that it organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for funding to the municipalities, specifically for the establishment of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily targeted in the member countries, the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus also for the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve recognition in the opinion of some experts.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual member countries in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country are also the fact that, like other member countries in Brussels, the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and do not always win this battle.
After a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the designation "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the Inlanderrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us until 19. Turning back centuries, however, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák."
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the Karlovy Vary rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saaz hops now also appear in the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
I'm not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country were to work without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the republic be plundered for 20 years, how thieves roam freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm already over 40, and to that independent and non-party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
You made it to the Senate and then made your way to the castle.
Is this not turning your back on your constituents?
I have said to myself all along that I will take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the office of president, provided I am elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, scold the pub and in front of the TV, but put down anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media, which want to rob you of honor and that confuse the freedom of the word to lie with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You took up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations of more than 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you have no competences in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide to remain a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this one is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogmas from any party, I can take what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more on the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
To me, though, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important for me that we move forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it if someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach that.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in parliament, you only have keywords.
And you won't get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side to enforce these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally enshrine the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And those targeted would have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality who points to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I cannot achieve anything on my own; that is why I have spoken to several well-known personalities about whether they would like to run for the Senate as well.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, who refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who have left have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven’t thought about that yet, because I don’t have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; there are only 20,000 CZK in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You are talking about financial statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets to be about 60 million. CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin, by the way, was a children's dream - I've always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant to women and at the same time fighting evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
This isn't exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; so, for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood?
Didn't you say you're going to scale back these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan saving the republic.
But I also have to make a living from something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As president, however, I would quit my ventures altogether.
You can find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily to one of those old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a barely-to-sighted sleeping city just outside Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges depicted on the Euro bills as pretty brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master the statistics: A library must come here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the foolhardy bar charts and producer of witty, even often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared for competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around him and shrugging with his armpits, the cheeky Maas stacked his exquisite souvenirs in size to a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that's him, my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain has been piled up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small-town resort, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, enriching a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true joys of space and reading are open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak unmistakably the language of a public town square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already look for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and put the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology headquarters.
A special joy are the black bookcases, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes parapet, sometimes a stirrey railing.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even diehard architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the Standard's request.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm one day.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long hike you will not only be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Buchenberg is under a glass fall, the sun shines only briefly inside even on sunny days.
The wide wood glue binders, which stand transversely to the glass façade, serve as shading and absorb much of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already venturing into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library, which has not yet been fully stocked, are to be filled - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
“Thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just to the ornament.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in achieving the supreme discipline called identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recording of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing it on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then, however, Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Does it be difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's true.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still approaching their role, but they are on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to hit the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely matters.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to that either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as on the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect with it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that his interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly advocated for a veto.
Are there any disagreements between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a bit of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government, of course, cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual disagreements are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu's policies.
Does it come to Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead need to drive things forward from their own position.
They are doing that with the euro right now.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany even want to take on a leading role?
Or is Germany still struggling to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a larger role, various anti-German sentiments become free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is continuously diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

'Brand protection' in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're getting right.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The copycats already have a few additional letters enough to be allowed to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On the 14. In September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that also made use of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injuring intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch urges.
"The brand is being watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third-largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing market, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because after the long duration, the objected name had become a "market reality."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he would even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star to this day.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that was reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient staffing and room equipment.
Last year, however, we have returned from the emergency situation in the workflow to normality.
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still awaiting completion in the office.
To tackle it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new registrations around the world, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were taken.
Simply, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to achieve that his illegal fabrication of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One has failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the objection of the Munich residents.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be careful infernally
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely elaborate and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had even had to look through one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-figure euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spill back into Europe.
That is, when impersonators secure unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, but it was still able to avert the registration.
"You have to be hell of a watch," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his trademark drama, then one would probably have to pay royalties for his own name to the other side, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir is rehearsing Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then only the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the house husband.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, Unaids estimates, the United Nations program to fight AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found godfathers in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser on Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
8 733 kilometers by air from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, much of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the small is what all of Swaziland is suffering from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a hot meal a day.
But just one year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs include HIV, human pappilomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups of people concerned?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), tripper and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: Around 20 percent of new HIV infections are accounted for by this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human pappilomaviruses are also common among adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been falling since 2007.
There were around 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of senex?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, subabodial pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide one hundred percent protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Be diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late effects avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the association's chairwoman.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their head and make sure that the children in their uniforms show up on time for school lessons every day.
If you no longer have anyone, you will come to the shelter for Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI, that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is most likely to be silent.
A King with 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned life form that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms would exist on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through the South of Africa and sings songs full of wistfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know from the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already braved some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," say the people there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of air to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is said to be possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadowy region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have smashed into Mercury.
But no one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the finds could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unbenotified by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are in the process of exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small peepholes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera that German researchers from the Max Planck Institute have developed.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new term definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, harder to identify the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - called W5 by scientists unromantically - has been discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This dazzling embers of a dying star have taken up the Spitzer telescope of NASA.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made of material that the star hurled out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiade star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come into their own.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks out to the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular colour scheme.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour scheme, shots of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years away, in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-split), since dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star-birthplace.
In the constellation of snake bearers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you do not have technical abbreviations, you may call it by its nickname Südliches Feuerrad.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a snippet from the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is what scientists call UGC 1810.
This star nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is always producing new youngsters.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, also constantly produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide, ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
Arizona, USA, is home to the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows glimpses of space equal to two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light-collecting power.
Despite comparatively small mirror diameters, this extends to that of the world's largest reflecting telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) enables any computer owner to help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover a whopping 42 metres - and be assembled from almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures are to be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks up in the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF next to them.
A new, huge telescope is also to be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty metres.
Here it can be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since the 24. April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily for those that are habitable.
On the 2. In February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
The picture is documented in the picture the last launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane5 rocket until 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrastructure telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks: it is supposed to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to revolve around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysch lives, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfect Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
The terminus is Lerik.
The small town boasts of too bulky architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too arduous is the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, arguably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child still fathered
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate by a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a reseent researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"A striking number of high-aged people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents, no scientific proof of age could be kept, especially since civil status registers were missing.
Every day beaking melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it is because of the diet.
But the fact that the high-calorie food of the Talyschen should be so healthy, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that rolls her tirelessly back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never ran out of me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pensions are enough to live
She has only ever eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the period after World War II.
Yet everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
Yet the cult driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows little border in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old.
230 manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grey son is right: "The ancients enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country's deep division.
The future constitution with Sharia law as a base is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spar with pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they are all, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, Mohammed Morsi said, had almost apologetically curtailed the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are not quite clear about.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a newly added article: In all matters concerning Sharia law, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiance in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These courts served to suppress oppositionists during Mubarak's rule.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it is in the draft, “protect the true nature of the Egyptian family” “and promote their morals and their values.”
This is so fuzzy in terms of legal terms that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain English, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious, the wording suggests that the "insult to people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
An interpretative matter, as so much in the draft, which is available to Morsi for signature and, according to his words, will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum "very soon".
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar concord on Friday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down the charter even before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belonged "on the garbage mountain of history."
Via short message service Twitter, he accused the supporters of Morsi wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition activist Jasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced they did not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the land!" and asserted: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
Morsi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
“The word human rights doesn’t even happen”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairwoman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten up, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are glaring violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto overriding it," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You are bearing a monster you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country's secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, moist sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
One has to imagine the nasal-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt, which - depending on how smelly you would like to have your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" also hosts the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Candy people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'll taste some bites.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a quite long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and - no doubt under the help of alcohol-subdued senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was far richer than Norway not so long ago, immigrants are flocking.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, if strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind that.
Here, one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident of the 22. July."
Norwegians struggle to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for Norway's wealth today, growth has been one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Their English is spotless just like most people here.
We are not very showy, we do not like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very cautiously - a large part of the industry's revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the Great Depression, everyone threw money around them that they did not own, Norway kept its purse tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eating rakfisk," she adds with lighthearted laughter.
I stand in the snow and line up for a different dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat is mouthing me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can tune in for the best - or perhaps the smelling senses most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
“Here are our points, Havard.”
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
Even on better days, this is a constantly clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected, which shuts off several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential tie and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proven itself well economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My administration is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto declared in the Oval Office to U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went on an equal footing with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the holiday resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the development of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," according to his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway overpasses and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was involved to combat the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch of wasteland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the past two years alone.
During Governor Pena Nieto’s tenure, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately tackled the problem of women's murders during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beating, and the mortuary rigidity had already set in.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But it is precisely these, according to the family, that they have been denied so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a chatterer, troublemaker, nagger.
They want their judgment to be accepted and shut up.
"But that's not possible when there have been so many formal errors and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential tie on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his tenure.
"I hope as president he is the way he was as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutors claim Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment
Prosecutors contradict Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time at military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a dismissal of the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The U.S. Army Private Man is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
Prosecutors on Friday attempted to determine that Army private Bradley Manning - charged with the biggest revelation of confidential information in U.S. history - failed to find out several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained to Maj. Ashden Fein that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the prosecution - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh term of detention - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday's hearing, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he had been detained under increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility overall as "very professional."
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints of ill-treatment, although officers had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them. However, they were not logged.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," according to Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to have his observational status downgraded to "prevent injuries."
The military testified that it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one level under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday for his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transferred to the Quantico naval base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once fallen unconscious due to the heat.
Not to be allowed to know what is happening to him or in the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light, which entered his cell from the outside.
If he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning on an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to envelop himself with his blanket during this count.
At the questioning on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order of his guard that he should drop the ceiling he could have covered with. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He would have previously tried to show an official that he was not a threat to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his degree of detention should he be convicted at his trial in the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges deemed too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon is sticking to its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all detainees held in Quantico under the highest security precautions.
Charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had only just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control when perplexity spread in me.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that one expects when the minds of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason why Mexicans are just as likely to remain in Mexico today, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even if he did not give specifics in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country's leadership under gunpoint to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official makes even mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - complaints about how Americans are harassing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma embark on the warpath.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge, in truth, lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - didn't get a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have lived the American dream, attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of it that it is the American dream we are living - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurry, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
What's more, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class don't like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent it.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
Yet many Mexican Americans I know feel they do not belong either to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there's something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational middle class want to resume their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We are to tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
This isn't gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual admissions of guilt, countless buildings have been laid to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have been smashed near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Yet although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will just lead to more bloodshed.
Yet there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate given the current situation.
Even if the one on 21. Ceasefire agreed in November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the hardened on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself has suffered large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million Gazans are crammed into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a resurgent, regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken sides for Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, via Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist imprint could face the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his 2011 overthrow, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is in-laws with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, allow an opposite conclusion to be drawn.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more soundly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is steadfastly holding on to its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barrier facilities that run into the West Bank and thus into the bulk of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, but are being expanded ever further.
Netanyahu is well off. His Likud party has turned out in the run-up to the elections on 22. January under Avigdor Lieberman allied with an even more combative group.
Why even these deceitful Palestinians coddle and leave them a state of their own?
If they were indeed in control of the West Bank, would they not fire rockets just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them should they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to prevail. Yet the Arab Spring could put a dash through the bill for them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense budget of Israel is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
That pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be an auspicious sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an impetus from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel is ceding territories for security purposes.
The hope, which is small for the near future, is that the ceasefire will grant outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms shipments in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial swaps and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must do his part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the notion of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he was also averse to involvement.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into effect
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, is from next Saturday.
Australia is thus introducing the world’s strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco use.
The government is proceeding from studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will probably not start smoking even after that.
"You can see from children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
The laws would favour black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the corporations failed the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian court with their contestation of the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale business and is waiting for new holdings.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, the catch is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibiting them from acting as sports sponsors and forcing most traders to stop laying out cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to promote their products can't get around the internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed a rise in testimonials on brands written by "quite normal people."
One has to ask oneself the question: is this just a private person who finds such great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry, rather than marketing, is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest the new regulations - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries are engaged in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to impose photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'll just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," Victor El Hage says when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to replenish its shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're shutting down," he adds visibly angry.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to worry about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are citing boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us nowadays are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing free time.
Yet Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Pompeii's house walls adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. According to Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to pursue a satisfactory activity, but not being able to do so."
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing."
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, though these two states might be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just struggling to concentrate.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in English, for example: "The Idle Mind: The Definition of Boredom from the Aspect of Attention," which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for these and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or exhausting task can lead to boredom, disturbing attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one performs a monotonous activity - "just like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat them by staying physically more attentive to people.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to stomp around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," according to Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a booming loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people are more easily bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to boredom vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale are statements like "A lot of things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys become boring more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as far as the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli is concerned.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tight-knit heap.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents at school and doing homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
Yet only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, that he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "the youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a big influence on their everyday life.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - this is what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best right now.
When you’re bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you’ll be happy.
But television can create feelings of happiness in the short term, but these evaporate in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, you can dissuade it from boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to the other".
The child not only learns to converse, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We shouldn't see them too critical either.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even beyond the constant activity and technology sprinkling.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the excruciating, unceasing desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to get busy when the noise is once silenced.”
There is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law in Colorado
19-year-old Community College student and footballer Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeast Colorado for a misdemeanor that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke these.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - cavalier offences, each with a penalty of $100 - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of regulatory offences revolving around marijuana are already being dropped here and in Washington state, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities are no longer pursuing adults over the age of 21 for possessions to a small extent. This will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into effect in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative counties have announced they are pursuing existing marijuana offences, still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting on preventing new, state-owned marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads rattled.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and in doing so have a deadline of 1. December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation. There, the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the regulator of spirits in Washington state.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, kicks in on the 6th. December in force and thus also forms the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how the state requirement of "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On the 21. In November, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora declaring that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences in people over the age of 21, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for these offenses "as of now."
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce urban guidance on regulating medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers will continue to be pursued.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck holds a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been charged for other offences.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offences at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer indicate adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state have brought to light among local officials a profound dispute with regard to the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents defendants in court for marijuana offences and acts on the spot as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting individuals for the fact that they still cannot accept legalization," he said.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national model cases for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sale, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will yield.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama administration's drug policy adviser, believes that while criminal investigators are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are presumably resisting the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums on new marijuana stores, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban that is likely to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," according to Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
We are guided by what the municipality has chosen and not what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once considered to be the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I had left because I would have had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighbouring room.
The author A N Wilson mischievously explained that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my now-deceased father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights are suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford, meanwhile, has developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal protections for equality that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable because of their political views."
They are calling for a place on their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which portrayed Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford's conservative student association, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and flaunted with a silver-coloured suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-designate of Oxford's conservative student association, says she has observed a growing rejection among JCR members towards students of the moderate right.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks at Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
The previous year, the university had voted not to award an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even made Stalinists startle.
In the first days of the first-year week, during which new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even participated with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the government's rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I should have French texts from the 18th. Translate century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled in the process.
Pitt was a little man with a face like made of cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes, tears were pouring out.
"I suggest that they take a few French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone tipped me lightly on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
At a local pub, I later tried to pretend.
I insisted that I not on all points with Mrs. Thatcher agreed.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically attended the Eton College, considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I not be able to meet like-minded people until after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly revealed himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, small-minded.
They would never do something like that, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always displayed impeccable manners.
His damp eyes clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also A Tory supporter, had given in to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly fell apart from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing," calling them "old suckers."
The relief only lasted briefly.
It was my father who slapped the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You are welcome to call me a whiny slack.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of accommodation with an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of haute couture were put together, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is still until the 3. March will be on display, there will be a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick out their tilts on your glorious carpet, like some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as e.g. B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the fashion maker's charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, you recognized and felt his influence.
"All those invited felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good upbringing and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk that suggests a role swap: the user takes the model's place and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in the "La"-e.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn/winter collection.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was living in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th. century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society."
Married for years with the elite's "savoir-être," Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honor, cumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his peace, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay a month ago.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
“He was spotless; time leaves no trace on him.”
And this is what a princess says...
The world's most difficult profession: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must descend every day to the bottom of his crater, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders across the sloping paths of stone.
While it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted wearers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at the turtle pace, while they must maintain balance and carefully set their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen's miners earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they make their way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the deposits in the volcano and (never better so) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," Anto explains to us, who usually does three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as much as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have taken them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at Kawah Ijen at risk for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but punished by life, young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and gets up at two o'clock every morning, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
The shadows challenging, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 straps load on the crater floor the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrying.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stocky, 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to educate his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners clamp in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious illnesses ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest at the age of 30 also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation on generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human burdens at the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame them for not having children, on the career, stress and cost of real estate and raising children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candies, but still - or precisely because of it - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song that shows local sayings such as e.g. B. "Pushing will make a "bao" (loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the commercial will reach a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reprocreation, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as. B. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
Therefore, we thought: why don’t we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as. B. to compose a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Singapore government.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the national population authority, says this was due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to get married and form a family substantially more options in terms of life goals and prioritize," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and the delay of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely concealed xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the ruling party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are being built.
Thus, it is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they are deterring the construction companies from building large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This causes them to be much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, who were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, it is clear from the talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district that they will not have a big impact.
"People are severely stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says one young manager.
The kids can get others.
"It's important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and cost of property and education as reasons they can't have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline private is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years old?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who frequently travel on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't announce my deepest secrets in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB, I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me, or of someone taking the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to knowing 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he states.
According to the boy, no one made him insinuate or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone is harassing me or asking them to come on, I'll just remove them from my user account," he admits.
José reached out to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences that are now known as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe one out of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, thinks that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of the social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants they are supposed to teach, when we are still learning ourselves," he said.
He explains that it is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what is allowed to be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They are also supposed to be picky when it's most important to them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the professional, the most effective way to teach the children and young people is what privacy is, to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling you not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why are you doing it on the internet?
Or: Would you like to be posted a photo of you, like the one you posted by a friend?
You know what the others are posting about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission beforehand if you have labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to trade online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is imperative that parents carefully read through the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what to share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unsur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6. Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was to be signed theoretically by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly attempted to access the signed document at the VI. to obtain a proper meeting of the heads of state and government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the exam, but then declared that it would be published on the Peruvian government's website at some time.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulating among the journalists was received by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Presidential Office of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the statement of Humala and not the official document at the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III. Summit South America - Arab States (ASPA), and also on this occasion, despite a strong request by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they limited access to information to a great extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently putting forward to this international court," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains, continues to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," Piñera adds, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IJC came after Colombia, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a grave mistake, brought an action against the Bogotá agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the rulings of this international court of justice.
Present at the summit were the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unsur since 2011 following the removal of its president, Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit meeting in Lima shortly after lunchtime.
The head of state read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
To the decisions made, he said that the countries of Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we will expand the decisions on residence rights."
He said measures would be pushed forward to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised, cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant features, but is intended to expand our production output and show a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a read statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, which would be located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasised at the Summit.
With this in mind, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to respectfully deal with the maritime conflict following a judgment of the ICJ questioned by Bogotá.
"Possibly I will meet with President Daniel Ortega on tomorrow day (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilizedly and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, in which the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region is to be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is chaired by the regional bloc.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually being able to learn something from Europe."
Correa, the one on the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, declared to state television in Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and in other disputes" and "are practically a fatherland today."
With this in mind, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that is driving the member states of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those that have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he declared in reference to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that at the time there had been "founded assumptions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not followed his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had required him to question him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish case law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be affected.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," Ecuador's head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a confined space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since the month of June at Ecuador’s embassy in London was the granting of a free pass, with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant conversations.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a number of proceedings on various European authorities,” he said.
And "if Britain grants this free pass tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London or via Skype, as allowed by Swedish case law and was done in other cases, the problem was settled.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that invalidates free speech."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for and blackmail profit," he said.
With that in mind, he congratulated himself that Ecuador was no longer dominated by such journalists "nor by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election he "will deepen the revolution to continue on the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism must "remain hard and must not allow any opportunism and no one to take up as a legally disguised coup d'etat" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The president of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely justified."
This ruling is not currently being implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice, and said that "it is right for Latin America to invoke international authorities if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
In terms of the possibility of him standing as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would retire from political life.
I have never been interested in power personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was me that guaranteed this likely victory, that's why I have to meet that responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This is true even if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It in no case does it mean a relapse in President Chávez's health condition," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader took today in Lima on 6. Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) part, which was ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of dying because of AIDS today is too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb was hit," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "tooten off" without any discernible success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he was just his 43. Birthday celebrated.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing of their disease and in which the virus has already caused harm and has exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The infectious diseases expert and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that while AIDS was not a death sentence, that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the people's immune system at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent would have greater chances: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 can easily turn 75 years old as long as they are under control," this professional explained.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the individuals come in far advanced condition because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all people who require this need to be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason that it had made a friend of his, who despite his young age was already in the AIDS phase and even the AIDS phase.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then rather burst three times," one says in my case.
The change was toward improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," enumerates Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the worldwide AIDS Day.
You should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this purpose "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were handed over individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The at-risk persons for new infections include the adolescents.
"Why do you need them?" is a common mocking question from social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, to which young people do not want to expose themselves, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms are said to be located not only behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity is not to be promoted.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in a sexual activity," he put it in a nutshell.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally on 4. Set new and cumulative AIDS cases, and on 13. Place on HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal upheld a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro group's liabilities, which was reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the Land of Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the lead on the 15th. June received recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas that the Mexican companies are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to Mexico's largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court, based in New Orleans, initially states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in proceedings in the event of insolvency of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a conciliator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed among companies in the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds, e.g. B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have gone out of 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not considered by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro to blame for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family lodges an opposition to the same Court of Appeal, so that the vote is held in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the cerciorare objection is filed, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), in which the procedure conducted by Vitro is described under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, and in which it is pointed out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cross-border insolvency which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the ads by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not advance for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (union association of pilots) has finally made progress.
The request, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of the bank IXE’s Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental facility that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government did not comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, even though the Senate had taken the opportunity out of consideration because it viewed them as a violation of free speech on social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock market certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Formed by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, a leading company in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is above $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, first-national league player, agent and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"All my life, I've put on a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes doesn't exaggerate with that statement.
The walls of his home are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether it was as managing director, co-manager or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Would you like him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would make for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already the top of the association in 1988.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won against the USA for the first time in the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze if it hadn't been for this Canadian referee who had we repeated the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
This team was not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be present in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the occurrences at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated as much as Piculín at this level.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which initially embraced the BSN in the early 90s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else is left to do?
There are things I would have introduced, like e.g. B. the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce z. B. play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and every now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman turned 21 on 21. Born in Forth Worth, Texas, September 1931 and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of 80s greed has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release from The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace, Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He gave joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted he had been drinking a lot over years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He was also a performer of two comedies that only aired for a short time, such as. B.The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematic work included critically-rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was intended to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in betting houses.
With that, the series reached a viewership record at that time.
When the response became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave town. But others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), instructed.
"I know what's supposed to stand on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should mean "This is where the honorable citizen J.R. rests. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers in the world and remains in our hearts for us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was complete, and a sixth chapter has just been filmed, the broadcaster informed.
From Warner or from TNT, there was no immediate explanation as to how Hagmann's loss would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm someone or interfere with them in any way," the Associated Press said at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I'll meet with them when their operations are imminent and after that," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as B. "Don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as e.g. nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backwards counting" of the Mayan calendar on the 21st. December, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, whom some have called "Deudarmaggeddon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place that Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history, classes on the "end of the world."
In Temple, the assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as e.g. nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and looked at how they could compare to real life in comparison.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a co-chair professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple designation "The End of the World."
"We're not taking in 2012 so we always keep the option to be able to hold the course anew, in case the world doesn't go down," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent doom," students must study, create projects and take graduate exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than "to continue working until night, where the world is supposedly coming to an end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places," Restall said of his high-average students course, which filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old female student at Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic cult or religious mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains to having seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less of a professor - explained, on the last date of the 21st. To believe December.
"Our first project covered the prophecy of the Mayans, and in certain ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that takes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has increased this speculation.
"Elsewhere, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly responds to the question of whether he would know a course there on the "end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an insinuation of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days have been spoken by the last court over the years, and said that if on the 21st December nothing happens, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized about the 21. December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they would like to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'm calling some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
