Barack Obama becomes the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to become the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check for 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Nordweg metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time ever with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious award.
He receives this as the fourth US president, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when accepting the prize.
The president does not want to avoid this issue, because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The programme of events will include a banquet with the President and his wife, which will be attended by Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the beginning.
He stated, for example, that he felt that he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is the price not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was for him "call to action".
Conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases, he appealed against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Association is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find sorting waste containers at every turn.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I don't want to say that waste separation in Brno doesn't work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors do not take care of this problem sufficiently, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the jungle league in the waste separation, not only because we as citizens are only allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Did they ever try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at the centre, for example?
That's art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moravian Square opposite the Hit Goose.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be annoyed, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not a walk in the park in other parts either.
That's why whole rows of my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It is too far to the garbage cans for them.
I am not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street I didn't see any paint garbage cans in sight.
Luckily, I came to the right place while riding the tram.
But the garbage almost overflowed.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leaves Brno's socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that puts us to shame throughout the republic instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering to sort more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my assumption even with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is the worst in the entire South Moravian Region.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party, despite the government's view, gave more money to farmers and civil servants, there is no money left in the budget for pensions, sick pay and home savings business.
But also not for the sovereign debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed through the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow additional money for sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or sick pay. "This is just postponing the problems into the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The loans pay ever higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they get this money.
But at the price that the state becomes even more indebted - next year not only 163 billion will be missing from the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster and, along with it, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the value-added tax only slightly or to reduce the maternity benefit, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the passing on of money to some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheaper.
At the very most, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large buildings, and European money creation is also endangered, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion flowed from CEZ into the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidations, replenish the pension account and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP.
But the carnival of upheavals does not end there.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for the court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court battle, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister then has to save the money within the department or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two-billion project "state treasury", which should make it possible to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in that case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
All you need to do is press a button, and Windows Mobile will alternate with Android within a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
On the market it will come in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran in parallel.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to reach customers within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneelose slopes worry not only the Krkonoše residents.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the Spindelmühle exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate with the order.
If you prefer to save money and where the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think that they will continue to try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and go for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will quickly dwindle, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still available.
That's why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said Petr Schiefert, director of the travel agency Ingtours.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
The first fourteen days of February also sell well, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Krkonoše Mountains.
People wait to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms in the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February business will also go well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia at the central car park in Janske Lazne is also 80 percent occupied for New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne remain free at Christmas.
This year, January pleasantly surprised us, for which we are already occupied to about 60 percent.
February is now a bit weaker, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the Krkonoše hotel owners are waiting for a bigger snow present.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, warming will come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical with what student ambition Barack Obama, the president with his reputation for the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on Afghanistan, whom he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it via copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh troop contingents to civil war-torn Iraq as an "irresponsible and carastrophic decision."
Months that followed, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful to the extent that Iraq is no longer talked about in the news today.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, because objectively he has left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military have again asked him to increase the troop contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination habits harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
What is most problematic about the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well structured, and its leaders honor its values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correct, remain only fictitious buildings, behind which the patriarchal trunk relations will continue to proliferate.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the circumstances, which further complicates the Pakistan and Iran influences.
Also, the construction of an "effective state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers who have broken out in the war cry about the "early return" create a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul who is not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, setting the date for troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America proceeds after Obama to the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, leaving enough time for him to resort to a different strategy, if it proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash rewards bonuses
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonus bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
"I think Wall Street is aware of the direction it has to take," said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain reported Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-off 50 percent tax on bankers' bonuses exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record women took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the disciplines and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the chromosone range.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only discipline in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This prize was won today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the cash prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controvery of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey and, moreover, he is at the head of the country, which is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of next year's state budget in the form approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps Janota will remain in the cabinet will be the topics of Friday's meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate his remaining in his function on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which Klaus is now getting signed, the Czech Republic should be running a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In parliament, however, the Left Party proposals for the currency revolution were voted on Wednesday and the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers was increased.
The government has countered the Social Democrats' proposals by covertly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, which raises the question mark over the further work of the Fischer cabinet of civil servants, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed to shape in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by parliament, effectively liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed by the Fischer government in the autumn, which they see as ending the national debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to, sign the law on the state budget, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" of "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only be achieved by a strong government, which could also build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek pointed out that the budget is horrible and that the government should consider its continued existence.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas told CTK that the concept of the cabinet of civil servants with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to Topolanek's words that the budget deficit that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year was horrible, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I'll have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", already played the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who eventually became a slave owner, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak like him
The film depicts a true story in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that even after apartheid, his people will still remain divided racially and economically.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the big screen.
He had no other goal than to play that role to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
"I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt like I know what you're feeling," he said.
For me, it's important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time at his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Undefeated" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light mystery over Norway solved: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted only yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested not far from the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the missile known as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site during the rocket tests also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already write about "Bulava" as a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights up
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over northern paths caused by an indeterminate flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generals have objected to this, claiming that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was made without errors, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generals with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself again at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and will probably compete in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemcinov's coach of the Moscow club.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, teammate Nemcinov listed.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, it will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles and he has also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
Due to frequently ordered overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees also receive this retrospectively for the Saturday shift on 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek explained.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning issue regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory had been forced to work 2 hours of overtime practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
Once the agreement is signed, the unions revoke their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unionists are to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfillment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the willingness to strike.
The situation in the car factory came to a head last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management countered that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive delivery needs.
In their Monday declaration of readiness to strike, the trade unionists also demanded that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday would not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for overtime to be kept to a minimum.
In addition, they demand to pay the remuneration of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production was started at the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles had been produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that is also effective against 'steeled' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS can not yet be cured.
However, the drug combination can prolong the patient's life and prevent the multiplication of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus replication has also led to the development of so-called virus replication. Resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances known as metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus replication in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-fold cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the multiplication of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against HIV protease was tested in test tubes, including their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy  of the sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS attacked Fischer, who fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It supposedly takes time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the cabinet of civil servants with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
Parliament approved the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, albeit with Left Party amendments amounting to more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased money for civil servants' salaries, social security maintenance and direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democrats by covertly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, so it complied with the government's request, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the provisional budget. Frase not clear
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the prime minister for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominants of the Social Democrats (CSSD), who pushed through the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the extent to which Fischer is in favour of a further fight against the budget deficit.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sick pay and pensions or the service law amendment.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
That is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a text message from the USA.
It mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a deputy capacity who are committed to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be topical, then I will deal with it, Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Civic Democrats, told journalists in parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for the European Council.
ODS resigned at the request of the prime minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked Civic Democrat MPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize that my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be all about Bolshevization of parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
From 13 December, Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some underutilized express and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer fares will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have several connections to the capital, and the railway will use Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), by a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice route will also be cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice route will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change trains in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Main Railway Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run every two hours.
Since 13 December, passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The express trains have been ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and the railways will receive a total of four billion crowns to settle the so-called liquidity loss next year, exactly as this year. The local trains supply the districts, paying a total of eight billion crowns next year, with the state contributing three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has concluded a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps that is why they have not resorted to the price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only apply to one-day CD Net network tickets and low-cost eLiska Internet tickets.
For passengers without the loyalty card, the CD Net price will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the route driven, so far it was uniform for travel between any district towns and cost 160 crowns.
Filipino militants arrest more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million people allegedly used the hostages as a living shield while escaping from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police prosecuted the kidnappers for the violence, which called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was imposed over the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was linked to the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday they resumed peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be released in American cinemas "Invictus: the Undefeated", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon has been given the supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the theatrical release of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, and in 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed on the film because it is coming to the cinemas at a time when South Africa is culminating in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media is shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to the new film in South Africa have been consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about casting American Hollywood stars in the leading roles.
In his own words, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person several times so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he said in an interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a South African story, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, loosely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African champion of human rights during his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and mutually distinct populations and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African national rugby dress on the World Cup field, which South Africa won at that time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received a huge ovation, mostly from the white public, for stepping onto the lawn in dress, which is considered almost like a sacred ordinance in South Africa, and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may succeed in uniting people into a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But white South Africans are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps transformer in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to Lukas Marvan, spokesman for the Usti nad Labem district fire brigade, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later they changed their view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the pipeline system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage can only be quantified more precisely after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened at Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
According to CEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, and the fire at the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates on Czech territory as the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transmitted to the distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura files criminal charges for defamation against three heads of CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today filing criminal charges for defamation against three Social Democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice Region and the head of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in Radiojournal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have only made the offer on the scope as agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways because we know the Czech Railways prices that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do the same.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told Radiojournal that he is suspending the campaign after Christmas and plans to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
Jancura launched the campaign after the districts reached an agreement with Czech Railways at the instigation of regional railway transport and did not put out to tender for the contract worth 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, he threatened, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we did not renounce it, that we could then also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free of charge and voluntary
Imfung against pneumococci changes the usual from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The drug institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 last year and later can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further revaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccine doses.
But they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of children.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause otitis media, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to examinations in hospitals, up to 28 children up to the age of 10 die each year due to pneumococcal infections.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, this should be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association is already promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I believe that this is the path we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairwoman of the Society of Pediatricians Practitioners, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents will vaccinate their infants against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination to be paid for by health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of the general paediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines were to be purchased through the insurance companies and the doctors would then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "take the money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance companies to pay for them.
According to estimates, individual general practitioners will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his trailer vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayals of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Frank Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "to enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied having given any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and spending freezes announced in the pre-budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wage settlements for 2011.
Social security trouble
The unions have protested that low-wage earners are being punished for a recession they did not cause, warning of "problems" ahead.
The increase in social security – to about £3 billion a year – has angered the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
FOCUS OF THE PRELIMINARY BUDGET REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy contracted by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses scrapped
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 a year and someone with £40,000 a year will be poorer by £190, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult choices", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending freezes were "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour Party's predictions of future economic growth – affecting the size of new borrowing and the speed of deficit reduction – were called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to contract by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the debt of £3 billion would be higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who plan to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis", said the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay this and "cynically" avoid difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They haven't said anything significant about what they're going to do," shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let it pass."
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to the Conservative proposals that see deficit capping coming sooner and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money gained from the tax increases and spending freezes will be used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that some of the timing of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April – would expose the Chancellor of the Exchequer to accusations of vote-catching, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Hollow budget"
Although ministers have not announced budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only materialise in the medium term.
The renowned Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor of the Exchequer's figures would mean sharp cuts in many areas, possibly including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It just shifts the pain until later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at accounting firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-budget report. The markets are recognising this."
FBI Investigates "Arrests of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is indeed the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuses' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been for the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential election in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he had been charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was treated with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head ... burnt. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty said.
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been held with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but Amnesty said the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people have been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to transform a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Fourth-year student John Hickman said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the city lights glittering below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the hillside.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted to ban minarets and concerns about the supposed Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and considered report on whether Muslims can — and will be — integrated — into one of Europe's most avowedly secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a controversy that divided and occupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects can still be felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer what Bowen calls "Islamic freedom" to France's 5 to 6 million Muslims.
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students on the issues that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-rate banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia – who now have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be treated harsher than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the screws of values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The bleakest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks them is melting at an alarming rate, taking life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have ventured into the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea who fought only with the butt of his musket is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at one performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the habitat of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore turned green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Referring to the accounts of other authors and historians, Ellis often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of these two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping glimpse into how the future might unfold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rapidity of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century gave an idea of the turbulence of the pack ice for the first time.
During the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting ridges when driving under.
A useful addition is satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look into the strange, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater rivulets that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could be the us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
Corporal De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It's now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife, Karen, who make this trip every year, stop at various towns along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also formed a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (wreaths throughout America), which has expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas around the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a late professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from World War 1 and 2 and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black-and-white place cards that had been stuck in the damp mud for those whose tombstones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the gravesite of Naval Infrastructure Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free..., my son paid for it, she said.
"When I've been away for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor detained by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not yet been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, on charges of "endangerment."
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro Brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide something in return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is in expensive hotels and there accessible to foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly false.
One activity that would be legal in any other free society — giving away free cell phones — is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the U.S. section of Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a tough report on freedom in Cuba titled "New Castro, Same Cuba," a reference to Raul Castro's inauguration as the country's leader.  who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that very often the defendants are arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered an alleged leader in a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope the case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after locating them because one of them had made affirmative comments on terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men upon their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the government official, who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were detained by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men — who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI — underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to house human assets within al Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, not letting in those whose commitment to holy war is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also seen as tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, as US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?"
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen demand climate "action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate protection from negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were closer to around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some downtown government buildings.
On a day when little was happening at the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists marched through the city with banners reading "There is no planet B" in English and one in Spanish declaring "The Earth says "Enough."
Some stars joined the protest, including Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to Peru, her mother's country of birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That's part of the motivation why I decided to join the big demonstration — to pass the word on and appeal to world leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police stopped protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, saying they arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a bystander, who asked not to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters dressed in black detonated several explosive devices near Copenhagen's main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to reach the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international deliberations, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that whether the demonstration would harm or help depends on the individual's perspective.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with negotiations or other people's freedom."
Exam data show stubborn racial divide
The math transcripts were welcome good news for Washington D.C. public schools last week.
Although Washington District still lags far behind the country's top-performing schools, the reports show that fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth-graders from Washington, D.C., rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) over the past two years, but that of their African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth-graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was captured in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score achieved by children from both groups has grown over this period, the difference has hardly diminished to 58 points.
Some of the district's education advocates expressed concern last week that the findings, celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children.
"This suggests that we've raised the overall score by treating those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult," said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equality in Washington, D.C.
"I'm not jumping up and down for a range of two or three points," said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth-grade daughter at Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don't spend anywhere near the time and energy we would have to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills early in their school careers and who are significantly behind their peers classmates.
Everyday math, a curriculum that emphasizes games and real-life experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former principal school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
"I think we need to keep working to get the best measures for students who are below grade levels," Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP findings highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources needed for low-performing schools to narrow the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban exam scores.
The conventional remedy is to direct one's resources and management reforms toward schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could provoke political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point, of course, as with other city school inspectors, is that it tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements to closing the achievement gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the road to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a prospect for the future
The coach arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawn.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude, and that of the other eighth-graders in the group exploring Gettysburg, where classes cost $38,690 a year, was more that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the natural sciences building.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when told about the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th the kids visited on their three-day tour, and now they've fully absorbed the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but there are also hundreds of thousands who are receiving the college education needed to move up into the middle class.
In truth, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college — which is a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study high-performing children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get into college, especially if those efforts persist for an extended period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, then at some point a single measure won't solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP—shifting up a gear—and allocates more than $300 million a year to local school systems to launch college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went on to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry's 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play an important role in restructuring Iraq's oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to record shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that submitted a bid lost out.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The sparse representatives of American oil multinationals in opening up the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underscored by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely discouraged American oil companies, analysts said, from increasing their exposure to Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude reserves.
U.S. firms have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies able to sign contracts with the department.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with Iraq's oil ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have come away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the big players in the global economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for bidding submitted bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond current levels.
Top Al Qaeda Planners Apparently Killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, a top al Qaeda mission planner was reportedly killed this week, US counterterrorism officials reported on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs reportedly killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle toward the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of being militants ran to the site and quickly took whatever was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited vague evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as al Qaeda's top military planner, directing terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wished to remain anonymous, referring to the sensitive nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role for granted, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from al Qaeda's top leaders and translated them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had quickly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had excellent ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would become the second senior al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has slowed from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary by the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The oath's departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, due to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with Afghanistan's political transition.
The troop increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he was not stepping down, but was only fulfilling an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to send the notification to the UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now so that he has time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that he'd better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun the search for a replacement, according to UN officials.
The UN officials say he has considered Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that the allegations made by Galbraith – who was fired – "undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate aid efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying this would boost their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the reduction of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have only been able to hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not be allowed to continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplaying the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options for choice in Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that sticks on my mind is, if we've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability inherent in war."
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran faces "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear program.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be obtained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, Iran said it would resume talks to curb its nuclear program and give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But Iran appears to have since abandoned negotiations on the interim agreements -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leaders are divided over whether they should commit to the United States.
Iran's simple abandonment of the international community on some proposals they agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in ways they never were in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crushing sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations condemned what it on Thursday called "baseless and unsubstantiated claims" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it stands ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly over borders, property rights and public revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delays in U.S. plans to reduce American troop levels from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to allay Kurdish concerns about the impending troop withdrawal. U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Masoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, "We will maintain your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave."
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and aging population, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which produced two generations of notoriously fat, spoiled only children affectionately called "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 when this policy came into force, according to the UN
In 2020, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 per cent of the population to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of reproductive age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of aging populations and alleviate the labor shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- though not as rich -- as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Married couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have credited this policy with avoiding the critical use of the country's natural resources, while human rights advocates have condemned abuses in policy enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to have abortions.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were only children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Institute of Population Research, said government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children where one partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters lecturing families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city government has sent city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial counseling for those who have more than one child.
The response wasn't exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai said there was an upswing in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, urban districts, on the other hand, reported no change.
For example, Huinan Township, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai Caolu Township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that this is legally allowed.
But, like many Chinese, they have only minimal government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly view the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with their first child.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to caring for others and we don't really want to."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For middle-class parents with dual careers that reduce the birth rate, he said, it's all about being successful and you have to be selfish for that.
Today's 20-39 age group grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's capitalism experiment, and they don't want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the question of space -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- hitherto characterized by wild posturing and mutual accusations -- refocused on Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with developed nations bearing the heaviest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has both identified the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, as more than 100 world leaders will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a dedicated UN working group, is silent on the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key questions, including how developed and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers would support.
The process will be given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate change official, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture."
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which the industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted Friday's talks by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from coping with floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had dominated last week's talks.
US Special Representative for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by developed countries.
This move announced that the Obama administration was taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, Stern said, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement that the top American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" of him for saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China cope with global warming.
With the future economic direction of the major world powers at stake, fault lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is equally about saving individual economies and saving the planet, with China and the United States feuding over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will, at best, lead to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who chairs the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states' offensive "puts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most outstanding issues need to be resolved before the arrival of government leaders in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Vice Minister, got off their planes and raced through the corridors of the Bella Center for closed-door meetings and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people come and go of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are betraying and selling each other, and draft contracts are passed from hand to hand rather than by email -- is already challenging.
The intensity is only just building up: almost all the key ministers are here now, and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the top league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global politics at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225km/h train redefines the Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5:13 a.m., a whistle will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in transport in the UK.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h on its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London to Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, commute times would be radically reduced, and switching from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still put the brakes on Britain's high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will deliver the report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, according to the Times.
This will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will have a five-metre headway past urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In open terrain, the plan will demonstrate the concept within 25 meters of the final track.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northbound high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead into the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would run west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
Once completed, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400-meter-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people could run on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that London would need a terminus that could handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be upgraded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks this plan should continue, but the lengthy public consultation and planning means that a final decision will not be taken until after the general election.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in north Birmingham, which would still keep the journey time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered a crucial sticking point to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for £75,000 Conservative orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative MP, has charged taxpayers thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons have to live "on meager rations", has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to have an oak timber-framed extension built to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the extra interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the motions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenditure of the members of the House of Commons. Last night, Duncan said the motions "couldn't have been cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have fetched a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending control body of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a conservatory, which is referred to in the plans as an "orangery".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The committee acquitted him of breaking the rules last month after an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a £271,406 (€300,000) mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan was reimbursed about £1,400 (€1,500) per month as mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during that time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to fund the £75,000 (€85,000) borrowing.
The normal RBS stepless mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to £1,250 (€1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as Leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying after the spending scandal that MPs were living "on meager rations."
"Essentially, when you work for the state, you have to live on meager rations and be treated like s*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I claim a vanishingly small part compared to what is right.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked for his spending in May, when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this "could be considered an exaggerated demand".
An activist has dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Duncan's lawn as a protest after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and meandering or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's Beach Hut Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new purpose in life for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event kicked off on December 1 and visitors were allowed to view the newest hut every day from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. with complimentary mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", whereby the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a Chichester Diocese volunteer minister and director of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important again for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and have inspiring celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express that through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish leader of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to the fact that the "political price" of failure in Copenhagen would be very high, as these demonstrations illustrate.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed all in black, smashed shop windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-agitation police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimation mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, have been arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organisers of the demonstration, has sharply criticised the conditions in which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "indiscriminately", stressing that about a hundred of them were "still being held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has left Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the designated speakers for a candlelit evening with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators arrived by bus and train from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky-blue raincoats, made a first morning casserole in Copenhagen as they responded to the call of the Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has moved closer to environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, a figure of the anti-globalisation figure, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, has launched the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas, in which they praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand a vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network gathered several hundred people in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "prank".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "prank".
About 131,000 people were called to vote in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations will close at 5pm GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station closed, according to Abkhaz election officials.
The first provisional results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, declared his press secretary, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, illegally occupied by Russia.
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, killing several thousand people, Abkhazia wants to use this election to prove that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote at a polling station located in a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to supervise the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia gives Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready to go at any time, arrested about 700 people on the sidelines of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful procession marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the designated speakers for a candlelit evening with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters, dressed all in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-agitation policemen immediately surrounded you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman suffered an injury to the chin from a paving stone during the incidents, in which, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles burned near a squatted house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen as the police helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or in their own vehicle from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue raincoats, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, an activist at the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that are drying up, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who address the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has provided the impetus for the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised solar energy in front of the municipal government of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organised by the "Network of 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées.
The National Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history will emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not compulsory in the Terminale (12th grade).
"The students of the Première (11th grade) now have all four hours per week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but by and large a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He emphasized: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who were outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycea."
On Saturday, an IFOP poll published by Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) criticise the state's project to abolish compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th grade with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of the Terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe is the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that in Master 2 (M2) they take a subject-specific aptitude test at the beginning of the year and an admission test at the end of the year, in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year at M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as teachers in the internship.
He went on to say, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will achieve even more hours spent in front of students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" – a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the intervention at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts address the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
"We want to do something that reaches people and makes them feel like they want to know more," said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organisers of the day, on the sidelines of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Around twenty panelists were selected from among the experts, also on the basis of their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about global warming for hours. But the core objectives can also be set out in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he underlined, hoping that the audience would understand that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot from these conferences will be available online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
The prison officials' unions called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that bonuses and overtime, the payment of which has been postponed until January for budgetary reasons, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Penitentiary Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on employees who are not on duty to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and block it to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The 3rd Union of Penitentiary Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "uniting in a strong mobilization in the various prisons", where the non-payment of overtime, night bonuses and Sunday and holiday bonuses in December is denounced as "shameful and unacceptable" in October.
The first union of prison officers, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilisations (...) to show the dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them were included in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of prison officials, in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and modernise," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate measures to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime incurred, does not happen again in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore meager, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target bonuses, explains UFAP/UNSA, for whom the "budgetary constraints" have to serve.
"This is an absolute scandal," says the interregional trade union FO in Marseille, announcing that it will boycott "all meetings and convocations" pending new instructions.
"Staff don't go to work on Sundays and public holidays when the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without recruiting more staff, the attempt to enrich oneself with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says UFAP Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always gives Christmas better gifts than he gets.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he always gives better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave a glimpse of how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," affirms Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you nice gifts last year," she teases the president.
"Please," he implored her mischievously, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave it to you?"
During this hour-long casual broadcast with the well-known TV host who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us one Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved that little dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL confirms that he was put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday underwent another operation in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after surgery in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent another operation on Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "damage resulting from the operation of a herniated disc" he suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries would have necessitated another operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
When contacted by AFP, there was neither confirmation nor comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources indicate" that "no drainage" was laid after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The procedure, which was planned over several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a post-operative infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, that was not possible," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he did not feel any particular anxiety.
Still, concerns about the singer's health had grown since he spent nine days in hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, there was talk that Johnny Hallyday had a "minor colon cancer surgery", which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny being admitted to hospital again.
Euro 2009/Short course: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, won an international title over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short course in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a veritable flood of records was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in the 4 x 200 m medley and the other two by Russia in the men's 4 x 50 m medley.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a first at international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in bigger and bigger things and in this case I said if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations conclude their epic in Istanbul, which first began in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his personal best in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but he prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark's Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give it my all this time.
I knew I couldn't set a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA : Gravestone at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tombstone that turned up at the hands of French writer Emile Zola, of all people, was valued at $1.5 million over its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the III century AD and has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architectural décor, surrounded by satyrs and figures of Bacchus, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what buyers have bid the most for so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.  on.
The next fifty years lie in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "legacy of Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to home soil to be incompatible after he rejected escort by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Patricia Espinosa, Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Immigration Service, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and seek him political asylum abroad under escort.
However, the ousted president refused, as he wished to return to Mexico as the welcomed, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to persuade me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," M. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can easily stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the ousted president, who had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, striking a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for escort to us, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, interior minister of the coup government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only undertake as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of M. Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the ousted president, who had made their way to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had intensified its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This, he said, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had moved closer to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had surprisingly returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for high treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The president of the coup, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the disputed election, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the upswing, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has gained 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was quoted at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is only focused on "half-full glasses," she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixated on the US trade balance figures, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit of the United States fell by 7.6% in October compared to September to 32.9 billion dollars.
In contrast, analysts had expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
Conversely, unemployment claims in the United States rose against all odds last week and have now reached 474,000 requests.
However, the median number of new job seekers over the past four weeks has "fallen to the low point of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on government bonds over 10 years has risen to 3.482% from 3.432% on Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds over 30 years to 4.492% from 4.408% the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans in Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally that temporarily arrested a dozen dissidents.
Around forty "ladies in white", wives or political prisoners close to them, were booed in the street by partisans of the Raul Castro government, just as they were on their way to the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the empowered partisans with raised fists at the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place the evening before in Havana, in which there were no injuries or arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents who also made their way to Thursday's demonstration in recognition of International Human Rights Day were temporarily detained by plainclothes police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents booed by the government partisans to enter civilian vehicles by force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "requesting the release of all political prisoners", the number of which according to the dissident list is around 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, especially freedom of expression.
Madman kills octogenarian with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday late afternoon during rush hour.
According to initial information from the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the octogenarian for unknown reasons in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, succumbed to the consequences of his injuries in hospital, according to a police syndicate official.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he took a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, roughly in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured and taken to hospital, where the octogenarian died.
The other injured person is in mortal danger because, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become nauseous as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "state of shock," according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police, is said to have escaped immediately onto the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of them seriously.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including teenagers, are said to have tried to tame the madman, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has descended on him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife wounds, police said.
The action took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by approached me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in a first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person arrived, injured by cuts.
Forces of the state police have finally arrested the man, who had no identity papers with him.
The Public Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has appointed the District Unit of the Criminal Investigation Department of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been questioned by the court.
A police source does not rule out that he will be admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it scented six policemen to tame him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all mentally confused persons of this kind, in whom the forces are released during the course of events".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has demanded once again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution of his client, who is currently on trial at his place of residence in Switzerland for a moral violation from more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", has denounced gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeals in the Second District of California.
I am immediately calling for remission of sentence, M. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "made it run cold down your spine".
According to him, Judge Rittenband, now deceased, had argued with a prosecutor before he made his verdict, who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired," specifically by questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will ask for a trial to be conducted which would enable him to present the evidence supporting his arguments.
For its part, the prosecution has reiterated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts of which the accused is accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978 before the sentencing for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years was announced.
Since that time, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Assistant Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thereby despises its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out "that there are other escape alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested that Roman Polanski be dismissed.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded once again that the criminal proceedings be lifted.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this trial was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the initiative of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is held back by the rise of the dollar and closes without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed Friday without a price in a market torn between better-than-US indicators and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Frankly, the market is pretty quiet," noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "have helped to improve the market's view of the soundness of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts concluded.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and well ahead of expectations.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index forecast of the University of Michigan.
However, the indices have been held back by a new rise in the dollar, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, "pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground as a result.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year bond rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the previous day.
Miss World pageant again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which is being held in the Johannesburg area for the second year in a row, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a veritable vortex of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5pm (3pm Central European Time) on Saturday.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss are now concentrating on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream, of course, to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India interjects with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a Miss World committee official, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that can hardly be surpassed, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates went on safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and tasted the local cuisine.
What was quite extraordinary, however, was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her fondest memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way of the country promoting this event a little more.
I'm with people I would probably never be able to approach otherwise.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Championships, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday news is "very positive," according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," assured his son David on Friday upon his arrival at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been hospitalized there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (9 p.m. CET).
The singer's son, who seemed relaxed, assured that he would go "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial infection following surgery on a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and be able to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event Friday morning at Los Angeles' French high school, where their daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has heavily incriminated neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that legal proceedings may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles far too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I spoke to this doctor personally on the phone, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself have already had two intervertebral disc surgeries, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic milieu.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma after a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples", who has to answer "regularly" before the chamber board and is "anything but recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux issued a statement on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention had gone "perfectly" and the post-operative examinations had been "normal".
The surgery "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been lining since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), explained Mr Camus.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) alliance becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The alliance of parties, which is monitored by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt by Hervé Morin, leader of the Nouveau Centre party, to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and asked him, under threat of legal prosecution, not to use this seal on any more documents.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF seal, believing that François Bayrou is not worthy to defend this political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his efforts, he had received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now with NC), who claims ownership of the UDF trade mark because he was the first to apply for this trade mark at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF, which was monitored by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they would not allow themselves to be expropriated and set a deadline for the minister and the MP, under threat of legal proceedings, to stop using this seal and to transfer the ownership of the trademark to her.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to +adopt the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 bureau members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, calling on the NC party to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material and from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to "transfer the ownership rights of the mark to its legal beneficiaries".
If you refuse to do so, we will take legal action against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the undersigned warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the party "UMP".
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He profits scandalously and fraudulently from the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to carry this out for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is well on the way to turning into a crime and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems more dignified to us, in politics as well as in life, to make a name for ourselves instead of trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently appropriating a name.  to which one has no legal claims".
Liliane Bettencourt affair : François-Marie Banier convicted of exploiting weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the octogenarian to steal part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will stand trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum prison sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is being carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will talk to her, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to obtain donations totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted that she had been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a major family debacle on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer relied on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The Public Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, mainly because in recent days a guardianship judge has rejected her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full legal capacity, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The court has now decided to issue a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for staff to join "values" determined to impose the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization negatively affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) demands "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it demands from the employees a commitment that the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradict.
That's why we're calling for an operational revolution that would consist of putting employees at the center of the company's concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very limited benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in management practice?
I am afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the entire structure finally arrives at doing this as a matter of priority,... which it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
Emerging from the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that has recently been reactivated by US "neuroscience" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos encourages executives to adopt a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern businesses presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into any consideration or practice of management a basic protocol: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, company leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create fertile ground conducive to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "just war" earns Obama praise from the right
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech the night before in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who ridiculed the awarding of the prize to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president's speech, following the example of former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
"I liked what he said," Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs she had just published.
War, of course, is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sought to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday; a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, rejoiced the former President of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts I found this speech to be entirely historic, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show 'The Takeaway'.
The outgoing lawmaker, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "president of the left" reminding Nobel Committee members that they were "not free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush writer and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan," as he "always does," he has "spoken like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and that they are not doing much to protect," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a Bush era hawk, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, pompous and uninspired."
To the president's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about Barack Obama's defense of recourse to the armed forces.
If the war is packaged under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the address a "monumental work" even for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "provides a roadmap for steering international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily enthusiastically wrote.
The New York Times believes that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures supplies for Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike order and the looming severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, Dominique Bussereau, State Secretary for Transport, "welcomed" the agreement, which was reached on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted ways early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting angry.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement, and it was not until 6:00 p.m. that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we're starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some recalcitrants who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for workers," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, in particular, to address the issue of the 13th month's salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the decrease in employers' taxes of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft law on corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is demanding "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then to apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time," assures Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to annoy the goose-eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complains the Unostra.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens to "dig a big grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for Greater Paris and Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (Paris Independent Passenger Transport Administration), is making strikers wait with their demands for wage increases.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one in two trains was operational, and outside the central line only one in four trains was operational.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making an effort to connect the major stores with transport links".
The RER A line crosses the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran as scheduled during rush hour, and almost none during off-peak hours.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), explained that he had "got up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned for passengers to be looked after by staff and security staff, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
Trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via Saint-Lazare station to connect to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc. before.
However, that's not what drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long overdue wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage surcharge proposals in brackets, stressing that the top management "is unable to solve a problem, whereas it was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a new meeting for a "comprehensive review of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that had so far refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after the situation had calmed down.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line after a notice from Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). They also deplore the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which carries millions of passengers every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift work as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party; a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the 25-year-old conflicts.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Constitutional Court President Hasim Kiliç told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including leader Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from politics for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed proceedings initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party asserts that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The Constitutional Court's ruling interferes with the government, which is keen to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to dry up the Kurds' support for the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
DTP leaders reiterate that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the prison conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement used tear gas grenades and water cannons as protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision would "deepen the despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editor's note) issue by banning a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"One can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Rather, so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows throughout Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are driven by large gritting vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main traffic and through roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until rush hour traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is willing to make room for the gritting vehicles".
Only then, if it does not continue to snow, are feeder and access roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, on the turn.
The last priority is given to side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot soldiers of the FES set off, danger points and crossings are cleared as a priority.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is fast smoothness on these, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on its way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-tall animal walked on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not be anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which at that time lay in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic deposits, says team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Discovery confirms theories about early dino history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don't necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current doctrine, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the attribution of these primordial dinos is usually controversial.
For example, experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "longnecks" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (avian pelvic dinosaurs), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as they also possess the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time still formed a single landmass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could emerge, because in South America a particularly large number of primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare lateral line of the reptile tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic period is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship died out on the border between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flourish, which had also developed in the Triassic and had since led a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California stand on it.
Lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen will be present.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are showing solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in german and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building, occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike, vacated last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" with the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimation and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Presidium had evaded the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it is said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi state youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but have no understanding for vandalism, said CDU member of parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU is using painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left Party).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they had cleared.
The Left Party has tabled a motion calling on the interior minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a closely guarded location for secret armaments research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation, while Edwin Schwarz, Head of the Planning Department, signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armaments research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake pad
The dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than lowering a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into hopeless construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminal stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake pads of modern rail transport, as it once took an enormous amount of time to span locomotives from back to front.
Pull in, stop briefly, drive on - that's how it should go.
And that's why the terminal stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a through station, which is located about halfway along the trans-European rail trunk line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost priceless to implement lowering in the Hessian and Bavarian cities.
However, terminal stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern push-pull trains with traction units and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE line to Ulm is now being tackled.
State and local politicians have pushed it through.
Deutsche Bahn is taking part, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the republic are borne by taxpayers and not by the state-owned company.
In terms of urban development, the project can still be justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, which - if you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The through station and the line expansion are intended for passenger traffic, which - typically 80s - was attributed huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
Modern transport policy, however, must first and foremost focus on strengthening freight transport, as transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by road by lorry.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in Swabia.
That is the official figure.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
What is certain is that in the next decade there will be a shortage of money at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, construction has been carried out on the route in slow motion.
It would be urgently necessary to press properly on the tube here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews verdict on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will appeal against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH judgment legally examined, said Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing on this day that the state would have to regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided for by the state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population from nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to appeal against the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to waive an appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to ban night flights. Otherwise, this was to be regarded as a "breach of word".
It is damn difficult, if you are allowed to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government was trying to get to its night flights with "distortion of the law and trickery".
A detailed legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his parliamentary group on the ban on night flights had never been the way the opposition presented them.
US banks repay aid
The crisis-ridden major US banks are throwing off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And Citigroup is also planning to reimburse the state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have come with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised a good $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from its own coffers, which were well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank boss Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The cash injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors forced the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the personnel.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schachter, should this proposal not get through the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members.
The result of the vote had not yet been determined at the time of going to press.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted in favor of Brender and seven voted against him. Brender's recall was a bitter defeat for Schächter, but an expected one.
Because the Union majority in the Board of Directors had signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of ZDF had lost ratings, he rejected a further term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on ZDF was castigated.
Recently, even 35 constitutional law experts had intervened in the debate, who assessed Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
It was of no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance languages.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "heute-journal".
Subsequent positions: 1988 to 1990 personal assistant to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and presenter of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 Head of ZDF Foreign Policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced after the deselection of Brenders, who was elected journalist of the year by the industry journal Medium Magazin on Wednesday, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that the states should amend the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the director's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF.
Brender's prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move - by heavily criticizing the body immediately after the Brender deselection.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face and the board of directors could elect him without being suspected of appointing a partisan into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left-wing liberals.
Studies are cleared out
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder finally relented on Thursday: At a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs and the German Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor's and Master's degrees.
In the future, students should be able to cope with their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination load: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and "a realistic and justifiable level" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The Länder committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's degree programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of education and university rectors have been talking about better studyability.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially regulate the admission of study courses.
With the "significant reduction of the examination burden," explained the Chairman of the Accreditation Council, Reinhold Grimm, an "undesirable development should be stopped, which significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as contents are to be "strictly checked" to see whether "unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of
events".
The students have "the right to maintain leeway that enables and promotes personal initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it takes until 2015 for all courses of study to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany are responsible for this, which are subordinate to the Accreditation Council established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs had "emphatically" called on the Länder to influence the agencies in such a way that the wealth of material is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only state to date to pledge additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money will be used by the universities to set up tutoring programmes and strengthen student counselling as well as examination and international offices.
The state and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act in parliament.
According to this, only a single examination should be necessary for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies is to become more flexible, the recognition of credits at other universities is to be ensured and access to the Master's degree is to be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the state are to be checked for their studyability.
The government and opposition had argued again on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal executive committee of the Juso university groups demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, the students as those affected should now also "have a say".
The future academics received support from the President of the German Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a postgraduate master's degree.
On the other hand, the federal states must ensure that sufficient Master's study places with the best possible study conditions are available tomorrow for today's generation of Bachelor's students, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs did not comment on freer access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he uses disturbing scraps of language to address the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused a considerable non-literary sensation last Tuesday during a conference in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorting mirror of its securitates".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to Romanian-German fellow writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his work as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
Recruitment attempts began gradually, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "someone who has not defended himself enough against intimidation attempts by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that reveals the abysses and perfidy of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to current knowledge, not only perpetrator, but also victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said the literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "knocked him out" in all points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in form and before this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate spies, Herta Müller had already written in July in Die Zeit, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may assume, will have speculated and in some cases probably also knew which real name was hidden behind the code names Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the now very reliable inspection of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic clarification has been thwarted and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of the Securitate Files (CNSAS), which corresponds to the Birthler authority, was only founded in 1999, but the publication of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the management of files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high was proven by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former head of Securitate from Timisoara made disparaging remarks about the prizewinner.
She had a psychosis, after all, she had only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, as is so often the case in connection with concealed guilt, the Söllner case raises unavoidable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The level-headed reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by a thirst for knowledge than by blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote on the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a neatly dressed sales representative had just returned from a very nice Christmas party at which a sporting goods manufacturer had handed out goodies when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the outfitter, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight. ¨
The man with the striking bald head was chauffeured because of the city, which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not involved, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with happiness either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or really get going.
In the words of the Swiss, who was signed only three days earlier: "We have reached the knockout stages", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally tough fight against relegation."
The "much more important task" lies ahead on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat the premier class performance in everyday league life in Mainz.
And to eliminate the weaknesses revealed again after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League round of sixteen (first legs 16/17 + 23/24 February/ second legs 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy over the brilliant debut of Babbel's successor remained subdued.
Not only for the supposed saviour, who had conveyed self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to focus on their strengths, and encouraged them to be more courageous, said Gross of the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
It has sparked a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who takes action and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, this was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not out of the woods yet, warns sporting director Horst Heldt
But above all, VfB Stuttgart needs consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overtaxed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the rude awakening had come, Khedira pointed out.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal for the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We are not out of the woods yet.
The fact that Heldt was not in the mood to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann also saw the fact that his day off had been cancelled after games as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure egoism," Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will probably no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combative strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Heated duel in Bern: Again and again, challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old champion according to the version of the WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) in Bern on Saturday night.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout that everyone expected.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to admit defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-meter-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left leading hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly evaded the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous right decisively to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000 who has gone with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had caused quite a stir before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
At the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the USA in his title defenses.
I only got one blow in this fight and am physically in very good shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA, however, wears the Briton David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had previously canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
Allegedly, his promotion company is now already planning the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left Party are demanding clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the latest findings on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception.
The Minister had told the deadly bombardment on two tanker trucks in September, "knowingly the untruth," said Green parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
This is commonly called: He lied.
The order to kill was given in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
The Greens, SPD and Left Party called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, Bundeswehr and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery had not exerted any influence on concrete missions of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the ministry's account of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the tanker truck attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
From the environment of the two top officials, however, it was said that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a Feldjäger report.
Wichert is now said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images while awake and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred, not only in the mentally ill and in drug intoxication.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to indulge uninhibitedly in the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
However, anyone who experiences dreamlike states while awake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is usually considered crazy or drug addict in the modern Western world, at least as an oddball.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality.
Dream-like altered waking states of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Even if the trigger and effect may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic raptures, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain - above all dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has any power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, sensory illusions of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. transforms into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and brightly colored.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted grimaces, baring their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, malicious voices boom from walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a noose and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a loudspeaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jumps.
The noose loosens.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices scream in eardrum-shredded chorus, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one was 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was caused by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The mirages are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric hospitals it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationship or paranoia.
Hearing voices is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or dialog.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person is no longer able to separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, similar to the dream, overwhelmed by the events and can not actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the mirages are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in dreams, says Fuchs, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, is fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats capers is still a mystery to researchers.
States of emergency can cause every person to lose touch with reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole determinants.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system comes about, which also does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether mirages are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of an astonishing number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and craniocerebral trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory content that is normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or insufficiently inhibited; when our brain is running hot or when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulus withdrawal, stress, lovesickness or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents said they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During the break, it may happen that a lanky boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other mirages are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the mirages are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the lesson material because the teacher is introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else to hear and see.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes far too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she shouts at the figures.
She doesn't tell parents and friends about it, they think she's crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus deprivation, they are very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at 13, she learned that the man she has called Papa for as long as she can remember is not her biological father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and auditory hallucinations that also process real impressions and sounds, sufferers like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is depicted there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also sees nocturnal dream images as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their mirages as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Borderline state between dream and hallucination
In our too consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative things - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-like altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
If a person is threatened by loss of self and the world, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world that is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is visualized in the imagination.
An intensive form of creating meaning and giving meaning in an inherently unbearable situation, which allows us humans our own creative ability not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness traveled for days after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train anatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
Is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He is completely absorbed in the imagined events, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still abundantly clear to me years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than what has really been experienced.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even when we are awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.

Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing boss Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100 percent owned by the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can't put your children in front of 7500 employees if they are not sufficiently capable.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire from the CEO in January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of Burda's Executive Board since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, responsibility for the company's assets was added with the treasury department and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure, also for direct marketing, foreign affairs, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding company should continue to be 100 percent owned by the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from extinction: "This always affected families who were infected by a capital addiction, who had completely speculated and thought they could become a major player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "never dreamed of world power," according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that's what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, which recently opened a store of more than 1000 m² in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find, among others, prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with laser; Spaxión, with spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out for its teahouse with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities,  that offers Spaxión.
The total area is 250 m², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personalized training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretches) are enough to train the body's muscles.
And if, after training your body, you want to stop by the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments to regain the splendour, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 am to 10.00 pm, 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolleté
Christmas is fast approaching and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. This can only be discouraged.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the sectors involved in it.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework contract is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include, but are not limited to, those related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and maintains a whole series of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts "a horizon of calm" for the Spanish car industry, which is the country's largest exporter.
At the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the government's year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would today have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export sector," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Global Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has allocated 800 million euros to projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn have led to investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The head of government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, alluding to the 2000E plan, which are being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan makes it possible to reduce emissions from new cars sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, baptized i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good marks in the overall picture.
The finish, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
If you look further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, is in line with the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can travel in the most comfortable way.
In addition to all this, there is a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It stands out for its delicacy, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with a petrol engine for its great comfort in shifting gears and its low consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) stands out, eliminating the blind spot, but also the controls for traction and stability, cruise control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth and the chrome-plated 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: among other elements, above all the adaptive Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD charger.
Result
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the Sportive model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pleasure every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, beamed more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails, without the possibility of viewing certain attachments or surfing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine named it one of its products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is unlikely, but the idea itself is still of particular interest to young people.
In contrast to smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one that's just for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a price six times higher.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data to be able to read your emails as soon as you cross the border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection possibility with Fon).
The idea of flat-rate roaming is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It's true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a PhD in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always gone unnoticed.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, even though it does not have Wifi) can offer these types of tariffs means that telephone providers will slowly but surely have to rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without contract and without hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, at the time of purchase, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase opportunity with lifetime Internet access like the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
Rather, I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at what is undoubtedly the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: apart from being almost the same color - a shiny greenish-yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric - and wore something large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ very much in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo one of patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was pinned up as a wreath of hair on this occasion, on the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and, if so, what kind of profession they have.
Those of them who do no other work outside the home, work only part-time or do not have a permanent employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone starting a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a permanent job do not have their first child on average until 3.7 years after moving in together, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent jobs who took longer to achieve this and who moved in together and did not realize their first child until much later.
In addition, the type of work has a great influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of readiness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when it comes to the age of women at marriage and having their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a lower secondary school leaving certificate or higher education, became mothers for the first time on average at 25.1 or 32.1 respectively.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a high degree marry and have their first child before their first permanent position, women with a middle or high school diploma do it the other way around and first look for a permanent job and then marry and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its universally envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz before her.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (actor colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The British Fashion Industry Awards Ceremony
The British have an important say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared for the occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and terrifying genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares neither horror nor enlightenment.
In addition to being a delicious read, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "Reading its pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: joy as opposed to sinister fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in going to heaven by the detour of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The Ulysses" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000m peaks in the world's literature, you have to climb up the north face, on the wall where the best mountaineers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny owl.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a county landowner and still other times he said that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams showed a certain greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane cry shouted out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo echoed in his literary way until late into the night of the 20th century. He did this during a journey on which he fled from himself and begged posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and begged: My revered God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'sleep after exertion,/ after the storm the port,/ the calm after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or the birds sang in Greek.
There is not a single other known case where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do but try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not introduce Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except destroy that man's glory so that he could put himself on this pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mongrel that we took from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they kicked him two feet, seriously injuring him.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us where the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the attack of suffocation that a woman who was walking leisurely got when she tried to reprimand these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with anyone.  who is weaker than himself.
The incident took place in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which involves "much more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer every day" and went on to reaffirm that they also contribute to this goal every day with other actions of an educational and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will initially distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin emphasized that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the fact that one of their main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are on the rise again
After almost two years, the car market for vans is finally starting to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase in 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to figures presented by the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam.
However, these good figures should be treated with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter light trucks/chassis.
Furthermore, there are still the same storm clouds in the sky that affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
Thus, in addition to these restrictions, which are the result of the cut off of the money supply of credit institutions, other factors must be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama, and unlike passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a Plan 2000E vehicle was of little help.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, self-employed and small businesses also have a right to it if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with CO2 emissions that must not exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Car Dealers' Association predicts that 2010 will be a year similar to the one just last, for which it expects sales (for passenger cars and SUVs) to fall by 19%.
Support during braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is currently happening with ESP stability control, emergency braking systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems, due to their operation, can also help prevent many rear-end collisions.
The task of the Emergency Brake Assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects based on the braking force applied by the driver to the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure to the end.
According to a study commissioned by the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even get to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked at full speed.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during braking.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that one in four accidents involving personal injury could be prevented - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the collision is already unavoidable, Brake Assist applies maximum pressure to the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturer points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected party to give its consent to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are plants, may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold by then will continue to be upheld.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they first dispensed with the automatic hinged roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, which alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used on this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15 "disappear"; by removing the air conditioning again 13; In addition, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty bacquet seats another 12 and with the lightweight 19-inch rims again five saved.
Then they had also achieved six kilos less by dispensing with the CDR-30 audio system and the missing kilo by replacing the door handles with fabric handles.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very winding.
With its driving behavior you can only give it the grade impeccable.
However, the reduction of his weight did not mean that he would no longer lie so safely on the road.
It's quite the opposite: we haven't tested such a small and light model for a long time, but at the same time it gives you a feeling of great safety when cornering, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a low gear in the time required until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything he is told. The car does everything we tell it to do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
One engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and you can increase it even more with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether from a standing position or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads we drove on with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car coped well with the potholes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; even though we found ice at dawn and gravel in the morning at some of these curves.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is otherwise rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and an occasional starlet at maison's fashion shows, presenting her evil face with the same stubbornness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many absent players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes in first place within its group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight times (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue-Reds, who took the lead on the scoreboard from the start.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come onto the pitch with well-warmed up wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava opted for an inside game from Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on his return to the team that is his home, to extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggested that this would not be the best evening for the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage at the break, the game was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "Yellows" turned the tide (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but far from dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get their breath again and one of them suddenly received the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that the scoreboard showed a reassuring distance of (54-67),  which the hosts were able to embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavese were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they honestly deserved in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was sent off for fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being defied
Unicaja lost vociferously to Olympiacos in Greece and had to cede the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game marked by the failures of the Unicajas players (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their performance in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first Unicaja, even though the local team managed with an inside game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis that the scoreboard showed 22-20 in their favor in the 13th minute, the minute in which there was almost a brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and their superiority in both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to injury and Carlos Jiménez's three self-inflicted mistakes left their mark on Unicaja.
Under their players in the field and the Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage to 44-32 in the 19th minute.
A race to catch up was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, showed itself to be superior and even managed to make up the difference of the match played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn wavered the lead within the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many absences and the retirement of Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja, some hope came back to 66-57 in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the effort of Lewis.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was unstoppable.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to admit defeat and had to cede the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can now know their salary, which they should earn based on their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form available on Facebook where they can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city where they work.
Just one week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels poorly paid," explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the Trovit product, in a press release.
Spaniards are the lowest paid, according to data obtained by Trovit through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The removed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21 before that date.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he will have to look for new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the appointed date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this was thwarted by Zelaya's refusal to recognise the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing sentiment in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising since this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers are making decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to give liquidity a free hand at interest rates hovering around zero, so that in this way the banks buy assets to settle.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are all but over and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to throw some sand into the gears, as BCE has already done with its annual auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia.
Stock market volatility and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to nationalise private risks and sovereign debt is rising again.
The focus is now back on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened to revise Spain's valuation again.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral hazard who had once again tried to create an awareness among those responsible for world economic policy of what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects to which the restriction of credit led to job losses.  when they should have decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and developments in Greece have been anticipated earlier.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government that pulls in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to bail Hungary out of non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thereby allowing a euro member state to no longer meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its citizens accountable for the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of normalisation of risk premia, after some excesses to excessive amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences are reduced and the Spanish ones continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local advanced indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to bring forward their scenarios for recovery and revise their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long lifespan despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although "be careful when driving" is the order of the day at the moment.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy regarding Spain's energy supply over the next two decades is currently being debated.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some bullet points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain operational.
If this is not the case, the investment required would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that investments should no longer be made in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question will change and you should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, provided, of course, by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, such as incentivizing national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly being pursued, despite some 'individual' measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets Aer Lingus' handling at ten airports
Ferrovial's ground-based airport services subsidiary, Swissport, Switzerland, is the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where they operate.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is scheduled to run for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans to invest EUR 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they already have a presence as energy and water companies.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are his competitors.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants to have the construction completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for a public-private collaboration (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll station management.
Pending the bids presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Acciona team is opposed by the Northern Direct consortium, made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures, and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium shortlisted is LBRJV, made up of the capital of Australia's Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), Baulderstone (also owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
Australia's infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisation, but it has one hurdle to overcome, as the only way to gain access is by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS entered that market only through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millions in assets
Acciona bets on this geographical area of utmost importance for the sector, in which it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill fleet (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies contracted to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The purpose of the underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Department and called Northern Link, is to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) through tunnels over a length of 5 kilometres. This is the largest measure to reduce congestion on Brisbane's roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of the contract for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even though this toll route is expected to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll collection system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
Brisbane is ready for big business for Hochtief.
Australia continues to award substantial contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a $154 million contract with the government.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre optic cable through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide high-speed internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million euros for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC wins contract for tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million euros
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has raised 64.5 million euros for the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company was awarded this contract just a few days after winning the contract for the 130 million euro extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria).
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has provided the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore was credited with a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
This contract also includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves for this competition organised by Renfe, 4 of which made it to the final round, including TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and manufacture of the campaigns.
Penalty of 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down the competition.
The competition regulator in France has imposed a €63 million fine on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased because the authority that oversees competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore reoffended.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company followed the example of other telephone operators and opened an application trade site on the Internet in order to increase revenue from transactions not deriving from the telephone connection.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for these products to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League match has earned Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
The Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since earned 476.4 million, earning them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning UEFA's Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since its creation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money from its participation and which, besides AC Milan, is the only one to have won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 occupies fifth place.
Top the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also made the most money from their participation in the last Champoins League.
And this despite the fact that they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that have been able to earn money through the champions, although it has more titles than any other (five, as opposed to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent contradiction is explained by the complicated money-issuing procedure used by UEFA.
This financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA earmarked 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought to participate received 3.8 million euros through their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each match they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the round of sixteen will each receive three million; the four who reached the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second who receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with their victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% the runner-up, 20% the third-place finisher and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday leaked details of its share purchase bid to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid over ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this postponement.
Yesterday, SOS shares closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz-based group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
Upon closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the legal quarrels of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post reporting directly to the Chairman of the Group.
This is far from free of polemics, because the company is involved in a legal battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar's loan, ex-advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing its purpose.
CNMV approves Paternina's public exclusion tender submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer last 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the legally binding laws and thus the content of the explanatory supplement submitted can be considered "sufficient" after the amendments of last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been invested, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender and whose price has been determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New vehicle inspection programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labor hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of reviewers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for accident assessment and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all appraisals are prepared with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for reviewing and preparing a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex Sales Manager, it works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is getting bigger and bigger, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and engines came onto the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image is created of each model, on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-selling model, the work can be completed in a week if the process proceeds quickly.
If it's a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of vehicle fleets on the roads, the figure is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the purpose of carrying out documentation and database work, each of which specialises in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million pieces of data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the commercial or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By reviewing the products Audatex offers, it's easy to get an overview of the kind of support it gives industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard accident assessment solution for assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the intended use, i.e. for each appraisal.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of appraisals negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it rolled off the assembly line by the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service on the Internet open to the specialist market, with which you can bid for vehicles that have been declared a total loss.
Their statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or obtaining information on deviations by brand and model.
It can be used, for example, to examine how many models of a certain car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for appraisers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide to Appraisals is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 the turnover amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

In Germany, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and today its shares are valued at $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the benchmark index Standard & Poor's.
Auction of crashed cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value to its customers, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This appraisal and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be re-registered, even if they have been deregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a quote in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, preparation and preparation of a quote.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then he can have the estimate printed and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the one focused on the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on being able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, as it allows you to select a door, for example, and then completely flip the image to look at the inside.
