This is James Risen.
You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly published that the NSA illegally intercepted phones from Americans.
But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for a nuclear bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like the chapter?
The US government.
For nearly 10 years, the government has been investigating Risen and asked him to name his alleged sources.
On this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media has the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave who disclose it.
So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something many courageous reporters were already doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.
So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was at risk of going to jail.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, although they indicated for years that it would be essential for her case, the government's demands on Risen were dropped.
The reason: In the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and causing risen to state, that could also take his digital footprints for him.
And so, without his consent, the investigators secretly obtained his telephone records,
Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even proof of travel with the list of his flights.
Amid this information, they found evidence they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risens's supposed source.
Unfortunately, that's just one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers when he took office. But instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. administrations before him combined.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.
Since the 11. September, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
So we are putting the press work at risk, which is to be protected by the First Amendment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone.
But just as government technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technology to better protect its sources.
And they can do so from the moment they make contact, instead of in hindsight, in the witness stand.
Today, there is communication software that did not yet exist when Risen had written his book, and it is considerably safer than regular emails or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblowers originally developed by Internet fame, the Aaron Swartz we've gone, and has been further developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the one here from the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.
So the government cannot secretly obtain more information, and much of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.
SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to the press freedom in the 21. Protecting century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new spying technologies that endanger us all.
It is up to us to ensure that not only technology connoisseurs like Edward Snowden have a way to uncover misdeeds. It is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,
who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental worker, who sounds the alarm about the contaminated water of Flint. Or a Wall Street insider who warns us about the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies have been made not only for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights.
Thank you. Thank you.
[On the 3 April 2016 the largest data leak in history was published.] [The "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and powerful have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [What does that mean?] [We asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we became of news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca
The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.
We get an impression of how clients, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, "Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?"
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.
This has already led to initial very direct consequences.
Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.
It is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend from childhood, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervously waiting for the next release, and for the next revealed documents.
Now that sounds like the plot of an agent thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems to be crying away from you, me, ordinary people.
Why would that concern us?
But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects all of us.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Around the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we've been discussing and revealing for ten years.
I think a lot of people think this whole world seems very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine it like a matryash dome.
So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these entities.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is a matter.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.
Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans so far who have occurred in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.
Yet by the principle by which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the U.S.
In fact, in some U.S. states, you need to need less information, provide less information to start a company than to get a library card.
This type of lack of transparency in the U.S. has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.
It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all this looks like in practice.
How does it actually work?
So we sent an undercover investigator to the offices of 13 Manhattan law firms.
Our investigator pretended to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
It really shocked us that everyone except for a lawyer made suggestions to our investigators about how he could transfer his money.
These were all preliminary meetings. None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was handed money in the process. But it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.
It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our undercover investigator.
It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.
It's about how the system works, by which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.
And to deal with this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.
This may all sound very gloomy, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there were always the rich and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I see that a lot has begun to change.
Over the past few years, we have seen advances towards more transparency in terms of the owners of companies.
The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the 2013 G8 summit in Northern Ireland.
Since then, the EU has been recording in central registers at national level who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.
One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. is lagging behind in this.
Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both chambers of parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the U.S. and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind sham companies.
We need leaders in the economy who stand up and say, "Intransparency is not good for business."
We need leaders who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of lack of transparency through legislation.
Together, we can finally end the lack of transparency that now still allows for this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.
That's the story of how I almost kidnapped once and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
A day after I graduated from my design studies, I did a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was just taking a road trip all over the country. After that, he would go to the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He told me how he wanted to change the world.
It was getting late. I got tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him, "Where are you sleeping tonight?"
He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."
And I was like, "Oh, man!
What am I doing now?"
Who doesn’t know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep?
But I just met him! He says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he's really planning this. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
That's a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say, "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room."
A voice in my head said, "Uh, how please?"
At night I was in bed, I was staring at the ceiling and I was like, "Oh man! What did I get myself into this?
A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.
What if he's crazy?"
I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaked on tiptoe to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't crazy.
We're still in touch.
The artwork he had bought from me hangs in his classroom today. He's a teacher now.
That was my first experience as a host. It has completely changed my point of view.
Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Housing people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.
Let's take a time jump, two years later...
I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving out and the rent is being raised.
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at the time. All the hotels were fully booked.
I think creativity can make it possible to turn fear into fun.
I texted my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've been thinking about how we could make a living. Our apartment becomes a designer bed-and-breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!"
We created a website and thus founded "Airmattrace and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress.
They thought it was great, and so did we.
I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured with them all over the city. When we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at each other.
Had we just discovered that we could make new friends and pay our rent at the same time?
Things got rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it.
This is how we presented ourselves to the investors: "We would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visitors come by.
Via the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.
This is going to be the next big thing!"
We waited for the rocket to detonate.
But did not do it.
No one who is still completely comforting would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's apartments.
Why? Why?
Because as children, we all learned that strangers are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you focus on the things you do well. We could design.
At the art academy, we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design do that?
Is it possible to build trust with design?
I would like to give you a taste of the degree of trust we sought.
It's a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up when you're ready.
Take your phone in your hand.
Now I'd like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to your left seat neighbor.
This quiet approach of panic that you are feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.
Because the only thing that's even more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to hold a stranger's unlocked cell phone in your hands?
Most people feel the responsibility.
This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.
Only for this reason our company can exist.
Just like that, who's got Al Gore's phone now?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for president?
You can return the phones now.
You have now seen what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?
What if your neighbor had first imagined his name; if he had told where he was coming from, what his dog or children are called?
Imagine you had 150 reviews that all say, "He can really hold very well unlocked cell phones!"
How would you feel if you had to hand in your phone?
Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.
In the beginning, we did some things wrong.
It was hard for people to make negative reviews.
Ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their reviews before putting them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We did a study with Stanford. We examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are to age and place of residence.
Not surprisingly, we trust the people who are most like us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It gets exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case by judging.
If you have fewer than three assessments, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation stands out in common.
So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.
In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you reveal about yourself.
Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.
If you tell too little, such as "Hi!", you don't get an answer.
If you tell too much, such as: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted.
So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. B. "Great artwork in your apartment! I'm going on holiday with my family."
How can you use design to create this degree of openness?
We use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text. We also give tips on which topics you should write something on.
Our entire company is building on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.
What we had not expected was the large number of people who were more than willing to put off these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people use our offer.
You can see three things.
First, unbelievably good luck.
Second, the tireless work of our team.
Third, a need that had not been met before.
For us, business is going very well right now.
Of course, there are also times when not everything is going smoothly.
There were guests who had been partying illegally or ravaging apartments.
Hosts have left guests standing in the rain.
At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. All calls came directly to my phone.
I was at the forefront when trust was broken.
There's nothing worse than those calls. It hurts when I just think about it.
The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.
Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays brokered, only a fraction each had a problem.
Because people trusted each other rightly.
If trust works, wonderful things can happen.
One of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!
Here is his assessment:
"Perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.
The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save your life, even though they don't really know you.
You drive you to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.
They even let you stay longer without calculating the extra nights.
I can only recommend it!"
Of course, not every stay is like this.
But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.
When I first stumbled upon this term, I wondered:
How does the idea of sharing fit with money transactions?
This is about economic trade.
But calling it simply "rent industry" now does not do justice to the matter.
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations.
People reveal a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
When you travel these days, it compares to fast food. It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
But what if travel was a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if in every place you visit, a group of residents there would wait to fill you thoroughly and show you a neighborhood you have never heard of on a pub crawl;
Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we designed apartments from scratch to share?
What would that look like?
What if cities accepted the idea of sharing?
I imagine cities that enable us to create society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation.
This project has already begun in South Korea’s capital Seoul. Many parking spaces belonging to the government,
were now offered to residents. Students who were looking for a place to stay,
were placed on people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs have been launched,
to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. Through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests of a stranger or even a host tonight.
So the idea doesn't seem as crazy as it was taught to us.
We didn't reinvent the wheel.
Hospitality also existed before.
There were similar websites before us.
So why did ours just work?
Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust.
Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I find that startling,
downright overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design for soon.
Thank you. Thank you.
What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? An expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or does a terrorist suppress, brainwashed, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay in the airport security check.
That's actually true.
I don't blame you for your negative impressions.
That's how the media portrays people who look like me.
One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show that Americans think most people don’t know Muslims.
Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslim, it’s great to meet you.
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.
I am an introvert,
a would-be fitness fanatic,
I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.
But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.
I've decided to do that.
When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my headgear.
My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "Why are you suppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: At that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, and indeed to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable ideal of beauty.
I didn't just passively accept my parents' faith.
I was wrestling with the Quran.
I read him, thought, questioned him, doubted and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
She was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Koran.
The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.
I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?
That's how it feels.
Later I married and, like all good Egyptians, began my career as an engineer.
I later, after my marriage, had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.
I was sitting in my kitchen, had finished having breakfast, looking at the screen and seeing the word "urgent."
There was smoke, planes were flying into buildings, people were jumping out of the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical fault?
My shock quickly turned into outrage.
Why should you do something like that?
I changed the television channel and heard: " ... Muslim terrorists ...," " ... in the name of Islam ...," " ... Middle Eastern ancestry ...," " ... Jihad ...," " ... bombs Mecca!"
Oh, my God.
Not only has my country been attacked, but in no time the actions of others have turned me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the U.S. to move to a new city and start his postgraduate studies.
I remember -- when we drove in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be alert," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't gather yourselves."
I stayed inside all week.
Then it became Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray.
And again, the warnings were: "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."
I looked at the extensive reporting.
The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or of people who were thought Muslims, dragged and beaten into the open.
There were really arson attacks on mosques.
I thought we should stay home.
But something did not feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
I got the people's anger at the terrorists.
Imagine yourself! I was angry too.
It is not easy to have to explain yourself constantly.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
It's the accusations that are harsh.
These days, we can actually hear people say, "There's a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.
When will we get rid of them?"
Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.
You're talking about my community like a tumor in the body of the United States.
The only question is: are we malicious or benign?
You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is kept only under observation.
The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the U.S. body, but a vital organ.
Thank you! Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will the closure of mosques make America safer?
It may keep a few parking spaces free, but not stop the terror.
The regular visit to a mosque leads people to look at other faiths more tolerantly, and to show greater citizen participation.
And as a head of police in the Washington, DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
The radicalization process has found that it starts online. First, the person is cut off from their community, even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash, which causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who loathes their behavior and ideology has fallen away from the faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to encourage people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like ISIS justifies their brutality with the Koran.
As a Muslim woman, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we have to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would put ourselves in their world of imagination if recognized as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you! Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has with Christianity.
Both groups claim their ideology grounded on their "Holy Book."
But when you take a look at her, she doesn't drive what they read in her "Holy Scripture."
It is her brutality that lets her read these things into Scripture.
An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she planned to join ISIS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was just the opposite. Every clergyman she had spoken to silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and something that would have given meaning to her anger, she was a main goal for instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.
This imam restored the connection to God and her church.
Instead of accusing her of her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque saved her from joining IS.
That was a glimpse of how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, our freedom of thought?
A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: If we fear, at least three things happen.
We are more likely to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.
A study shows that when test subjects are presented with messages in which Muslims have been reported negatively, they are more likely to agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in the context of terrorist attacks.
It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected.
It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well-informed citizens.
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is hurting all of us.
The allocation of collective guilt is not just about having to explain yourself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the Faculty of Dental, talented, promising ...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his resume. She was amazed and said,
"When did my brother's wife become such an accomplished young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, as did Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. He did it in their apartment, as in an execution after posting remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay home safely?
We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practice our religion.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the child seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.
I took him out, took off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the imam made an announcement, thanked us and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to stand by us.
At that moment, I collapsed.
These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you be on the safe side?
Or will you join those who think we are better than the ones.
Thank you very much.
Thank you! Thank you!
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.
But I wonder what do you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, are a thinker with depth, working in a noble think tank, so one exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I'd say you're not mistaken. I'm perfectly normal.
I'm no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I'm as ordinary as I'm allowed.
Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the biggest study ever conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.
So I'm not an exception in any way.
If people appear like an exception to the rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you. Dalia Mogahed.
What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. This is made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before air parcel delivery penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France live in front of an audience has built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks. A few years ago, they started flying with ropes.
By binding together, aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.
You can also build train-loadable structures independently.
They have learned to bear burdens, to deal with turbulence and to react generally to natural laws.
Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.
Our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous flight.
In order for a system to function autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. This enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today’s demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.
There are no external cameras.
Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.
External commands are available at the highest level. e.g. B. “start” and “land”.
This is a so-called rear starter,
An aircraft that tries to kill two birds with one stone.
Like other rigid wings, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
Unlike most rigid wings, it can float, and thus has great advantages on take-off and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
A restriction of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind this is that the aircraft can regain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing, no matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved.
Okay. Okay.
During our research, we often face basic abstract questions that reach the core of the matter.
One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that come together to hurt you.
Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder.
Recently, we discovered that flying works with just one.
This is the monospinner, the most mechanically simple remote-controlled aircraft. It was recently invented.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges and ailers, no further actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens in the interior so that it can fly stable, and can move anywhere in the room.
Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. To make it fly, I have to throw it just right.
The chances of throwing it just right when everyone is watching me is slim, so I'm showing you a video that was filmed last night.
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
You see that he is even symmetrical.
That's why he's ambivalent in his direction.
This gives him the extraordinary ability,
to move in all directions in space, no matter in which direction it is turned or even how it rotates.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.
Some things can be represented in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.
Let's look at this.
If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This aircraft here consists of two separate two-propeller flying machines.
This one rotates clockwise
and the other counterclockwise.
When you assemble them, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.
However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, although limited.
We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.
The last demonstration is investigating synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.
We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.
Every unit knows where it is in space and is self-directed. That's why there's no upper limit.
Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe machine over there wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.
For guys like us, the reward is in development and the creative act.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake on the i.
Thank you very much.
1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes circled each other faster and faster, converting the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.
It was a very big bang.
However, their energy did not release them in the form of light --
We are talking about black holes.
All the energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first schedule the events.
1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just emerged on Earth.
Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand by us -- even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which are created, for example, by colliding black holes.
Most thought they were crazy.
But enough people recognized her as crazy geniuses, so the U.S. National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work, they built the LIGO detector: the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory.
In the following time, the precision of LIGO was considerably increased, which enormously improved the detection performance.
It is now called Advanced LIGO.
At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.
On 14. September 2015, just a few days after the detector was put into operation, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the Earth.
You went through you and me
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
The birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my terminally ill father.
Basically, these were the fruits of my life's work.
All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: This is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. He has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories such as LIGO for 23 years. But what are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.
When the shaft is passed, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and compressed into the other.
In courses on the theory of relativity, lecturers often perform a really silly dance.
"Stretch and swim, stretch and swim."
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
On 14. September, for example, each of us was stretched and compressed when the waves hit. The stretch of an average person was 10 high -21.
That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. That's why the LIGO employees were declared crazy.
With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. That's grotesque.
At the end of his classic text about gravity
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "The technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to claim that LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.
I want to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your phone.
That's quite practical. Because this is how you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you.
It's different with sounds.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That’s why it’s very hard, actually impossible, to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you:
The face of your child, for example.
Instead, we listen for certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to conclude the story behind it.
"Now Alice is talking."
"And Bob interrupts them."
"Dummer Bob."
The same goes for gravitational waves.
We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.
Listening to gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been dealing with for a very long time.
SH: Two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simply: wupp!
If the two bodies rotate very quickly, you can hear the same chirping with an additional key change. It sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!
It is a kind of movement vocabulary, impressed into the waveform.
AA: On 14. September 2015 -- a date that at least I'll never forget -- LIGO heard this: [Surring sound] Someone who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH: ... two black holes, each with 30 times the mass of the sun, which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer.
AA: Let’s think about what that means.
Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around a hundred times a second before colliding.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know about it because we heard it.
This is the permanent significance of LIGO.
LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the universe that has never been possible before.
In this way we can listen to space and hear the invisible.
A lot in space we can't see -- practically or fundamentally ---.
A supernova, for example. I'd like to know why massive stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. We learned a lot from them about space.
However, the exciting physical processes take place in the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.
We will never look through because these are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first few minutes of space, but we will never see them, since the Big Bang is obscured by its own after-glows.
With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things in space that we have never seen before, that we will probably never see and of which we have no idea at all. Things we only discover by listening.
In fact, LIGO found things in the first attempt that we did not expect.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, a key member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: The kind of stars that produce black holes, as LIGO observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO allows us a completely different perspective on what is happening in space, on the formation of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as bold as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.
Because what could be better than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time of big dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you. Thank you.
Some time ago I tried an experiment.
For a year I would say "Yes!" to everything I was afraid of.
Whether it made me nervous, put me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say yes.
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be live on TV?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: doing just what I was afraid of eliminated my fear.
My fear of giving speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.
The power of a word is impressive.
“Yes” has changed my life.
"Yes" changed me.
But there was a certain yes that profoundly changed my life, in an unexpected way. It started with a question from my little ones.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. And Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all "darls,"
Like she's a waitress from the South.
"Darling, I need milk for my beak cup."
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. And I said, "Yes."
This Yes was the beginning
A new way of life in my family. From then on, I vowed to always play with them as soon as you asked me to. No matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying very hard.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has a startling side effect: Only recently did I actually fully understand that the "yes" legend to play with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I'm an author. I think things out to myself, bring them to life.
Dream job.
No. No.
I'm a Titan.
Dream job.
I'm gonna create TV. I produce television.
I make television on a big scale.
This TV season, I'm responsible for bringing 70 hours of programming out into the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of television. Three to four shows are in production at the same time.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows that are in production at the same time, sometimes four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: The Catch, 70 hours of television,
350 million dollars for a season.
In America, my television series run one after the other on Thursday night.
Around the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are shows I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of that. I need to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.
You know who else is doing this?
No one, that's why I'm a Titan.
Dream job.
I don't want to impress you with that.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I don’t just type around the computer and fantasize, and it’s true when I say: I understand that a dream job isn’t about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard and I love it.
When I'm engrossed in the work, there's no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nowhere.
It's like I'm setting up troops like I was painting on a canvas.
As if you were hitting a high tone, running a marathon.
You feel like Beyoncé.
And all this at the same time.
I love working.
She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and reasonable. And the best part is buzzing.
There's such a change in me when the work is going well.
A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could drive on it forever.
Many people assume when I explain to them the sum that I talk about writing, that writing gives me pleasure.
Don't get me wrong, she does.
But the buzzing -- when I started television production, when I started working and working and doing, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, that sum, that energy. The sum!
The sum is more than writing.
The sum is action and activity. The buzz is a drug.
The buzz is music. The buzzing is light and air.
The buzzing is God’s voice in my ear.
And if you have such a sum, then you can't help but strive for size.
The feeling of being able to do nothing other than strive for greatness, no matter what the price.
That's called the sum.
Or maybe it means being a workaholic.
Maybe it's genius.
Maybe it's ego.
Maybe it's the fear of failure.
I don't know. I don't know.
I just know I'm not made for failure, and I just know I love the buzz.
I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.
To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more overcoming boundaries, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I observe, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, don't I?
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.
I like that sum. I love the buzz.
I need the buzz. I'm the sum.
Am I just that sum?
And then the buzz stopped.
Overworked, overused, exaggerated, burnt out.
The buzz stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single work titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."
And Emerson says, "Darly, I want to go to Shonda-Land."
They are the children of a Titan.
They're baby titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz stopped.
The buzz of the engine fell silent.
I didn't love my work anymore. The engine was off.
The sum did not come back.
My buzz was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same titan work, 15 hours-days, worked-out weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no buzz.
There was silence in me.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a showcase titan,
Everything was gray, I just didn't have fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the buzz and the buzz was me.
So what do you do when what you do suddenly fades the work you love?
I know some may think, "Cry out, stupid author-titan."
But you know, you do it, you do it, you work, you love what you do, you do, you're a teacher, you're a banker, a mother, you're a painter, you just love Bill Gates, you just love another one and that gives you the buzz when you know the sum, and knows what the buzz feels like, if you already knew the buzz, when the buzz stops, who is you?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?
And then my "Southern waitress" asks me a question.
I'm on my way out, late and she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And I want to say no when I realize two things:
First, I have to say yes to everything and second, she didn't call me "darling."
She doesn't call anyone else "hard of a baby."
When did this happen?
I miss it when I'm Titan and I'm in charge of my buzz, and here everything changes before my own eyes.
And so she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And I say, "Yes."
There's nothing special about that.
We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops".
Nothing extraordinary.
But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the lack of buzzing, I can't do anything but pay attention.
I'm focused.
I'm quiet.
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, delicate voices, wax pencils and the song that is about letting go, or whatever the girl lets go in "The Ice Queen."
There is peace and simplicity everywhere.
The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.
I can't believe I'm breathing.
Playing is the opposite of work.
And I'm happy.
Something in me is loosening.
A mental door opens and a burst of energy comes in.
And not right away, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzz is slowly coming back.
No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.
Not the buzz, but a buzz.
And now I feel like I know a magical secret.
But let's stick to the matter.
It's love. That's all.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It's something we've forgotten.
The sum, the total of work, the titan sum, that's just the substitute.
If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television lessons and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real sum is.
The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.
It depends on joy.
The real sum is dependent on love.
The buzz is the stream that comes from the lust for life.
The real sum is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzz ignores the pressure of the story, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.
The real sum is simple and original.
The real sum is God’s voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I was a Titan?
It's just love.
We all need a little more love, a lot more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I'll say yes.
I make this a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.
It's law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzz again.
I wish it were that easy. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.
Playing is not the way I work.
The truth hurts,
But I don't like to play.
I always work because I love it.
I'd rather be in the workplace than home.
This admission is painful, because what kind of person would rather work than be at home?
Well, me.
Let's face it, I call myself "Titan" --
I must have problems.
That I'm too relaxed is none of them.
We're racing around in the garden, in front and back, back and forth.
We make little dance parties,
We sing and play ball.
We're bursting soap bubbles.
I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.
I always reach for my phone.
But it is o.k.
My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?
You can do it too! Always say yes when your child wants to play with you.
Maybe you think I'm naive, a daydreamer.
You're probably right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You're not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It's only 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they remember that they want to do something different.
It’s a wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I'm Mother of the Year.
It's only 15 minutes, that's all it takes.
Everyone can spend 15 minutes at a time, even on a bad-humour day!
15 minutes in a row!
No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.
The day is short: dinner, which makes children ready to bed.
But 15 minutes are in it!
My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. It doesn't have to be the kids. It is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for his peace of mind.
It's not about playing with your own children. It's about joy,
about "playing" in general.
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what's good for you.
Find out and keep it.
I'm not perfect in that. I'm failing and I'm victorious. Meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --
“Do you want to play?” is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to outdo myself more and more.
15 minutes at a time, why not treat yourself to a full 15 minutes?
What can be wrong with that? Nothing! Nothing!
The buzz came back in my spare time. The sum seems to be coming back when I'm not working.
Work does not work without games.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. She's tempting me to come up with new ideas. The buzz has once again made its way. I use it to the fullest and love my work again.
I like the buzz, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I'm not the buzz, the sum isn't me ... no more.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
That's my buzz now.
The buzz of life.
The buzz of love.
The buzz of the work is part of me, but only a part. And I'm so grateful for that.
It's a sniff for me to be a Titan. I've never seen a Titan playing trip to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more games.
And yet I have everything under control. My brain is still working. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my head is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. The country I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right sum: the buzz of life.
The more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, quivering, naked and new sense of life spreads within me. Less titanium -- more me!
The more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am.
I'm an author. I think things out to me, I bring you to life.
That's part of the job, which means living your dream.
This is the dream of this job,
Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more games.
Titans don't stand a chance here.
“Do you want to play?”
Thank you nice.
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one second to the next, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-heal.
After a serious violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.
This is probably why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
Certainly they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." An electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that neurological function improves.
It really is an amazing technology. She has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.
Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-cure.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are approaching this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With a little help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At the time, I was a senior senior physician and working in the emergency room day and night.
I often provided patients with traumatic brain injury.
You have to imagine that with traumatic brain trauma, the brain swells and the internal skull pressure rises.
To save life, you have to reduce the internal pressure of the skull.
For this, you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.
Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to very young children who are taken out of your families.
You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to let it thrive.
That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François made it.
He saw it under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why? Why?
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. With large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.
Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.
We made another fascinating observation: Normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They were slowly sharing and after a few weeks they even died.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brains.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.
But why are they preserving us?
We don't know that.
We believe they are participating in brain healing, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.
That's not so certain, though.
One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.
We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did
and then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain.
In the last step, we reimplanted them at the removal point of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: What happens if we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen if we reimplant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. We were able to work with monkeys, Eric Rouiller.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been taken back, they go home. The room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario, we inflicted an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew into mature neurons.
Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that have been reimplanted.
The evidence they show is these little dots. These are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.
Of course, we couldn't stop here.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.
They had to take feed pellets from a tray.
They did very well.
When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the hand motor skills sector in the motorized Cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.
Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to some extent, just like after a stroke.
Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to a certain extent, just like in the monkey.
When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left, they see the monkey recovering spontaneously.
It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.
He's not that precise and not that fast.
Now you see when we re-implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after reimplantation.
I can tell you, these were very exciting results for us too.
Since that time, we have found out much more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think, "I know someone who can need this."
I'm definitely.
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of study.
BG: That’s understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: Yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience, and an almost professional team.
BG: Look to the future -- You have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. If you look further into the future, how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.
JB: That's hard to say.
First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?
Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.
After that, you have to apply this to a multi-center study.
You first really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.
BG: And that it is safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and for telling us about it.
BG: Thank you.
Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake to take them for granted.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.
We tend to view it as an immutable fact.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That's not true.
Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great copycats in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.
Earlier this year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was made unequivocally clear as finance minister in the Eurogroup that our country's democratic process -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programmes implemented in Greece.
At that moment, I thought that there might not be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Chinese Communist Party, or some of my defiant friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it changed anything.
At this point, I would like to introduce you to an economic model for a real democracy.
I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and even the Eurogroup succumb to a misconception that we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.
Because without democracy, our societies are getting meaner, our futures bleak, and our great, new technologies are being wasted.
On the subject of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies.
I call it the "twin summit paradox."
You know a summit. They know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
But few recognize his twin.
A mountain of unused cash that belongs to wealthy savers and corporations, but which are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and could contribute income, with which to pay off the debt pile and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example, "green" energy.
I'll give them two numbers.
Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in the US, in England and the eurozone combined, in all the wealth-producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.
US$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the 5.1 trillion dollars that were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, and did absolutely nothing but inflate the exchanges and drive up real estate prices.
Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summits, which do not compensate themselves by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently low macroeconomic demand, which, as in an endless loop, reinforces investor pessimism, which, fearing low demand, promotes these themselves in which they do not invest. Just like Oedipus's father, who, for fear, the prophecy of the Oracle could come true that his son would kill him when he grows up,
unintentionally brings about the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.
This is my quarrel with capitalism --
his extremely wasteful nature. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to saving the earth.
So is democracy the solution?
I think so. But before we continue: What do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as the majority control the government.
Athenian democracy, of course, ruled out too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.
The crucial thing about Athenian democracy was and is that it included the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and more decisive that it granted them the right to political participation with equal weighting on issues of state concerns.
The Athenian democracy has not lasted long --
Like a candle that shines very brightly, it is also quickly burned out.
However, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens,
but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.
Because liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was narrowed down to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.
In today’s democracies, since the time this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle has taken place between the two, gradually subverting and disempowering politics.
Do you wonder why politicians are not the same as before?
It is not because of the degeneration of their DNA.
It's because you can be in government these days and still not in power because power has migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate.
I mentioned my quarrels with capitalism.
If you think about it, it is something like a herd of predators that has so sustainably decimated the animals that it feeds on, that it is therefore starving in the end.
It is similar to the economy, which has cannibalized politics to such an extent that it is harming itself by the self-inflicted economic crisis. The power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality is rising, overall economic demand is falling and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.
The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summits become, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity.
If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" retain control in the process, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.
This is not a new idea, by the way.
The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go down very well.
The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain only by a miracle a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem with this, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summits higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it will -- very soon, I believe -- come in countries like China.
So we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and in doing so, make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film "Matrix" seem like a documentary.
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to that in "Matrix" or by something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long conversations, the meaning of life.
I think we can be optimistic.
So what would it take, what might it look like to have this "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of the "Matrix"-like dystopia?
In the practical implementation, I would like to mention you in brief, a few examples.
In the area of companies: Please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you work in -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.
Then all incomes come from capital and from proceeds, and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.
No longer a distinction between those who own the companies, but who do not work in them, and employees who work there, but who do not own the company. No more tug-of-war between capital and labor, no more big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.
In the field of global political economy: Please imagine briefly that our national currencies would have a free-fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of all humanity.
Continue to imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- let's call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government will pay the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.
Also imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It's basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
The problem was that you didn’t have the technical means to implement it at the time.
Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.
The world I describe to you is simultaneously libertarian, in which it prefers privileged individuals, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash can of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.
But above all else, it's a world where we can imagine a real democracy.
Will we wake up in such a world
Or will we sink into a "matrix"-- similar dystopia?
The answer depends on how we decide together politically.
It's in our hands, and we're better off doing it democratically.
Thank you. Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If anything I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and business is ... If we don't, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers calls "long-term stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,
Like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm completely confused.
BG: Actually, and now we probably are too.
YV: If you're not confused, you don't think enough.
BG: That's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.
As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is happening -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democracy-free zone.
In some respects, if I may say this so provocatively, China today resembles the England of 19. century.
Because -- remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.
Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
He was particularly skeptical about democratic development.
What can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
Accusing China now of doing what the West did in the 19th. century itself has done, smells tremendously of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance minister of Greece earlier this year.
YV: I knew this was coming.
BG: Yes ...
How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a fresh start with the eurozone,
Not just Greece, but the eurozone,
adopting us from complacency and the constant denial that a massive line of dislocation has passed through the eurozone, and continues to proceed, which is massively threatening the development of the whole European Union.
We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --
to make it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to choose the denial.
But you know what's coming.
This is the experience from the Soviet Union --
If one tries to keep an economic system alive through political will and authoritarianism, one will perhaps be able to delay it for a while, but when change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructively.
BG: What change do you foresee?
YV: There is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.
BG: Did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone looking back -- Seriously...
If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has not made a mistake, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the application to extend the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the donors to find a common solution.
But there wasn't.
They just wanted to bring down our government just because they didn't want to deal with the faults that went through the eurozone.
They did not want to admit to themselves that they had been conducting a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
It's worse than the Great Depression.
No one from the troika of the donors who imposed this policy on us admitted: "This was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the conversations, you still seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.
My biggest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.
Because if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.
This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, according to which it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.
BG: We very much hope you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you so much for being with TED.
YV: Thank you.
Most have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on the 19th. April 2013 is responsible.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
That goes back to the decision Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,
the Amazon TV production company.
He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking out the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can't pick any.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are on the far right of this curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. The rating goes from 1 to 10 and the altitude shows how many shows this review receive.
If your show is rated nine and higher, this one is a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks, "Where's there more of these episodes?"
This kind of show.
On the left, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" --- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.
Roy Price isn't worried about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."
He's more concerned about the middle bulging, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't get excited.
So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.
The pressure is there, and of course it's also the first time Amazon has done something like this, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.
He wants to create success.
He needs guaranteed success, so he's holding a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight contestants for TV shows through an evaluation, then produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where anyone can watch them for free.
And if Amazon gives out stuff for free, you reach out, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they do not know that they are watched watching these shows.
You will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything.
They record when to start the show, when to pause, which parts to skip or look at again.
They collect millions of data to use this data to decide which show to produce.
In fact, they collect the data, process it and that results in the response, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators."
They did this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.
It's just an average show -- literally -- since the average of that curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so a little above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards.
Around the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's manager of programming. Just like Roy, he's always on the lookout to find that one super show and he's also using data for it, but he's doing it a little differently.
Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, i.e. the reviews they give to the shows, the course of which shows they like, etc.
Then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the parts together, they took a risk and decided not to do a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. So right where they wanted to go.
Of course, the question now is: What happened here?
You have two very competitive, data-savving companies.
They connect this a lot of data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
What's that about?
Because the logic somehow says that this should work for everything.
If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision.
It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.
It is optimized by very powerful computers.
The least you can expect is good TV, right?
If data analysis doesn't work like this, then this is a bit terrifying because we live in a time when we are more and more resorting to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.
Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?
Nobody. Okay, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. If you come into contact with it, you're in prison.
If someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asking for dismissal, it is likely that that company's data analysis will be used to determine whether or not a dismissal is made.
Just like Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.
Mediocre television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,
Not always producing the best results. That’s not because a company like multi-health systems doesn’t know how to use data.
Even the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong.
Even Google sometimes makes mistakes.
In 2009, Google announced that by analyzing data, they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad kind -- by data analysis of Google searches.
It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature".
It worked perfectly, year after year after year, until suddenly it stopped working,
And no one could say why.
It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature".
Even the data most accomplished companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data is increasingly pouring into decisions of life -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we should make sure that data is helpful.
I also know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably a lot of data to make serious decisions, like the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug. Over the years, I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. This pattern should be spread.
If you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:
First, break this problem down into its items so you can analyze the items; secondly, you reassemble the items to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this several times, but it's always two things: take apart and put it back together.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break down a problem and understand its parts.
They are not suitable for reassembling the parts and then coming to a decision.
There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brains.
If there is something where the brain is good at, it is to put parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, to then make a good decision -- especially if it's an expert's brain.
That's why, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience what they would not otherwise have been capable of. But the decision of how to take all these parts back together and turn it into a show like "House of Cards" didn't stand in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision for this show, which meant they took a big personal risk with that decision.
Amazon did so in the wrong way.
They used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say, "That's what the data tell us."
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data starts to manage our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.
Many of them will...
Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.
Many know it.
It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." It's amazing. For decisions using a yes- or no question, all you have to do is shake the ball to get an answer. "Highly likely" -- right here at this moment.
I'll fight it out later with a tech demo.
I've made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.
But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.
And I find this to be very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you do, and take risks.
Because in the end, it's not the data, it's the risks you're landing at the right end of the curve.
Thank you nice.
