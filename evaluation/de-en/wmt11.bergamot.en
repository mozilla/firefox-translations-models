What should it do, the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort or the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council.
The newspaper Aktuáln.cz has "tapped" members of the new council from the SSD, as they dominate the notorious slang that has become established in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced in the past era by Lord Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and cause.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in relation to these new terms are somewhat in the dark.
At least they claim.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," reacted to the test of the "Paten's vocabulary" responded to Lukás Kaucko, the new councillor for culture.
But the councillor Karel BÃ3ezina - a political veteran - also responded in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, whom I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktuáln.cz in this year of June before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague golf hole", "go to the confectionery," "bull snacking," "treason of the capital," and "tinker."
Three Prague councillors agreed with the test, the fourth - AntonÃ3n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolnek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the Civic Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves within our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukác KauckÃ3 would supposedly not have recognized in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janouek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says KauckÃo, but added to safety: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then not only deciphered by Matador Karel BÃezina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues LukáÃ1⁄2 PlachÃ1⁄2 correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
Both social democrats also know how to whom the term Voldemort stands and LukáÃ3 PlachÃ3 even suspects where this figure can be found and therefore also what it means to "walk into the pastry shop".
"I think that is to go to some Prague's gastronomy company," PlachÃ3 is quite close to the solution to the puzzle, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janouek's companies.
In accordance with BÃ1⁄2ezina, however, he asserts that he had had this knowledge gained from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be intended for him.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly naturalised slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is really no such thing with us."
"We shout at a spade's name, now and then we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulsnsk - called "Hulda" by his party members.
"At school, I was called BÃ za (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that way," Karel BÃ1⁄2ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper DenÃ3k Aktuáln.cz has tried the name and lo and there - it works.
For the party comrades, Ratsherr Weinert is friendly the "Grandpa" or less friendly the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention before the elections through machinations with party sponsorship, is called "Igrásek" (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
The only one that the Social Democrats allow to allow in the inner-Partial language are proof.
It supposedly does not like it when he is called "Hulda", but DenÃ3k AktuálnÃ3.cz also registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Keystick Rights" is allegedly to do with Petr HulsnskÃ3 acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are labelled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes" witch, it becomes strictly isolated so that it cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are also spared this, because they help with work and give birth to children," says a nun, describing the situation who cares more than one hundred women who have been expelled by their communities in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a specialized home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, published a pamphlet to stop the "ex-purchase."
But the thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed out the dilemma of the written education in the newspaper, the newspaper "derStandard".
However, being accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them with petroleum and simply lit them.
Among other things, the BBC server reported about this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
This is after the group tried to "push out an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard for their education.
"Der Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Winners of human souls are a danger in the past as it is today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian President himself said last year to the President himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh ignited a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"For this end, he called for help from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's personal guard, forcibly kidnapped the women and men from Gambian villages and took them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International, in their report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink a bud of plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats up in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly shelter is leaving the client centre of RPG Byty of the "coal baron" ZdenÃ1⁄2k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a portfolio with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just serves up a prison sentence.
All three were held in the context of the so-called. "Deregulation" just increases the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns month, the son is said to shell out 4100 crowns for a 2-bedroom apartment with a kitchen of the second category next year.
"And there are not even running water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he tips the son's new leased contract, when to sign it has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-tuned and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and until the 7th edition. To wait for December, when she intends to publish a guide on how to take action against such contracts.
But the man waves only.
"One says this, the other," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a fair rent.
Aktuáln.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havsov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on Friday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller device with it.
"Rent 2011", this is how a special tactile field on the touchscreen lights up.
Briefly taped and the device will spits out a number sheet.
As soon as we have decoded the number "157" and it is already beep on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it is your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the city will flutter into the mailboxes for most tenants of the 4,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the Ostrava region with the new lease agreements.
The RPG Byty beats them in the letters a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 percent before.
The special counter for the new rents in the client centre has been since the 18th clients November open.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies answer after a moment hesitate when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a controversial issue.
Before the elections, the vice-president of parliament from Ostrava LubomÃ3r Zaorálek of the SSD had taken up this topic rather loudly, no wonder that the newspapers are full of today.
"Twenty years old I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a beep. They were able to change WC glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning makes an air.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners are primarily at the counter to see for themselves whether they will really receive the promised tenant discount, which RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in good time.
The other tenants who have the new lease made by the new lease by 15 February are also to be enjoyed. December sign.
Until now, however, "deregulation switch" in Havsov is anything but overloaded with demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this," estimates the countermen.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not supposed to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre, at least in which it proves it right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 remain for meals, where should I get the money for a trial of court," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign, so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime, the director of the home portfolio of the RPG Byty company, and - the neglect of the housing fund, which was criticised by the tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase, in the opinion of the homeowners.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rents collected between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, there are said to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havsov, a few red shining information appears in between.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This at all means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre per month," reads on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is a matter of increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 per square metre," argues RPG.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not drive up rents by sharply, but will be gradual within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
However, priority should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw one - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architectural office of Arch.Design, from whose studios come a whole series of renowned Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for his company minikindergarten.
With wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom and the company is keen that the project architects return to their workplace as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers to reconcile their demanding profession and children's care.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded in winning over funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company minikindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of EUR 1.8 million). CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and qualified personnel and for a period of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and operation.
After the utilisation of funding (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, whereby the company provided a strong help with the application process.
The children take care of the very skilled staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can visit the kindergarten without age-related restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but several children will alternate away during the day.
The kindergarten business is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, especially they are offered excellent lessons - from basic findings to pre-school lessons, and they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company milieu.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress of the children delayed picking up from a far away kindergarten is no longer necessary.
The parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
In this way, Arch.Design joined the Czech companies, which offer clear benefits in recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and encourage their personnel marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is still fascinating after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa BatllÃ3 by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed the "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and living creatures.
Only closer inspection do you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well-thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting still enhances the gloss of the colours.
The same lively lines and winding forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-like wood copies the window frames, railings, ornamental elements of doors, even peeping holes and strips.
The house Batllo in the Eixample district, on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, which was executed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep BatllÃ3, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed with the idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudi did not design the Casa Batllo tenement house alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on its drawing board that made the decorations for the representative apartment of the realism owner and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painting figures and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batllo was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudi.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Milá house in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni GaudÃ .
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed the "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others, on the other hand, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "like-and-coming house".
It is also said that the sword of St. George, Patron of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudi designed a central heating system that was unique for the time at that time with vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tendency already seems a bit bizarre.
During his work, Gaudi consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and was by no means deterred by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so shocked by the result that they demanded remedy two years later at the completion.
Among other things, the councillors were also coming away with the fact that the construction and its pillars even intervened in the public pavement.
However, there were no changes anymore, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district, Josep Batllo submitted an application to approve the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner of the house himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery in 2. On the stick was a social salon, there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment on the third floor.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery shop.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
However, Gaudi also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the saloon doors and thus a larger society was able to chat comfortably without having to do without a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new facade, the house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors through Gaudi's conversion.
Also impressive is Gaudi's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is dressed and the courtyards.
The play of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colours, which, on the contrary, absorb the sunlight.
The Casa Batllo house, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now visit everyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided only in this year to this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this is quite a profitable business, one kept the visits, although they were extended to other joint and the attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price of visiting the monument is not a pattitude, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist ID cards receive a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed frame? Women have different desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, where heating is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than common polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough vent tubing in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that their mould forms.
Of course, when it comes to the election, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a longer period, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“All the ice hockey players who returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep properly here.”
"For their scraped shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these, among other things, sugar-sick people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specialises in upholstered furniture.
That's why I provided these mattresses with Visco foam with specta foam years ago, but also other customers.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works very easily.
The foam optimalizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere it presses, at night you don't roll around like a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound brandy).
When choosing the mattress size, one should still add the length of the foot to the body size, i.e. 21 to 34 cm.
Man as well as woman who are 180 cm in size, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm lying width available, together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example at singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on the back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterer and interior decorator, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for years and who also presents this topic to technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and his own mattress, but beware when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is nothing else other than mounting the grates at different heights and that is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be borne in the mould layer and fine cushion.
"You can't feel the feathers by means of your hand or when you sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully cushioned beds with mattress and base such as grown together Siamese twins have nothing to look in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already commonplace today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress is slowly becoming a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is one of the reasons why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has it ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, detachable covers, but it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even if today, mattress covers are usually made with round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (immens important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often seems like the uneven fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none in it) and mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called. Use pocket spring core and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad.
For non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 strips (lamellas) are suitable for latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), rusts with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more strips, with lumose support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility of regulating the slatted hardness.
Mattresses with spring skeletons do not belong to adjustable slaving grates, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the stretchers of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips in or even angle so that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to be reduced selectively.
Namely for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
Ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called. Multitorsion suspension determined.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillows for the right mattress and proper rust, most benefits will be lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion appears ideal, as the Scandinavians like.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw sacks.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word is also called "organic" for mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly being used to produce polyurethane foams - for example cast zinc and soybean oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic is called mattresses, which are their core of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vaek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents when sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool down the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes comfortably warm when sleeping.
And today's favourites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (he has larger pores with a destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams results in multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are located.
However, you have 7,000 crowns or more to shell for a high-quality mattress.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to be awarded this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with quilted visco foam memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, since they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft with warmth, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
This way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but also increases sleeping comfort in general.
Viscropive foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people monitoring equipment to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for cars for searches, can just as well locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently with the disappearance of nine-year-old Aniska Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet, but it soon should not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have terrified the case of the disappeared Aniska, thus looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a compromise of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is by no means about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy coming," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be misuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in your pocket to someone without knowing about it, but we have not yet had to register such a case."
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "skating mans" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bosková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"The cell phones already aroused great expectations for the parents at the beginning, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bosková.
In their opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper almost always checks whether the child has any electronics with whom it could be located."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such monitoring devices found wider use, they would also look for them, because their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta'ech from RC Monitoring, which provides location services for both automobiles and individuals, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is integrated, that is, if you fall smooth and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that this is either about matchbox-sized devices that resemble pendants or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger of losing it.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, they are testing devices that look like normal digital watches in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognise at all that it is a monitoring or monitoring Location device acts.
"Or he only notices this after a certain time, which gives the police a time lead," he adds.
No matter what direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle tracking.
So the combination of tracking function using the GPS system (just like the sat nav in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap all the Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of ignition lines, ignited with explosives.
The year earlier, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition lines from the joint-stock company STV Group, a. s. for former 40 million crowns.
In his justification for purchasing this huge amount of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use a fuse against the 60 kilometres annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to it, it is clear from this indication that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition lines.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two metres of ignition fuse are completely sufficient for the training of each new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to the Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the lack of funds are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't feel why they buy such amounts of ignition cords from us."
But that's their final decision, they'll already know what they need them."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as a dealer would like to reach as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan DÃ1⁄2ckÃ1⁄2.
Jan Pejek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres from the fact that the army would have covered this "amunit" for at least ten years.
However, Jan DÃ1⁄2ckÃ1⁄2 of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year use of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians even of only two years.
"The four years mentioned are probably possible with perfect storage," admits one of them, but he who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticising the army as a soldier.
After the service life has expired, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free, but cost further money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," says spokesman Pjcek, informing us about the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ignition lines by pyrotechnicians of the police, who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army, has been exceeding barely 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of these ammunition, which they can consume before the end of their useful life.
Already because of the security of the pyrotechnicians, and there is also the possibility of flexible shopping of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords open.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES suggested, the Czech armed forces can expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundred-kilometre-old ignition cords in a few years, which it has purchased so "inexpensively" today.
To this day, I have found the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning ranking in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Lukás Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the previous year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition was Lukás Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
LukáÃ3 Pytloun loves to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that it is a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he purchased a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous task.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says LukáÃ pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity, he has been opening four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel" until recently.
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun Hotels franchise have already contacted us," says last year's number one entrepreneur.
"A large share of this licensing sale to operate hotels had just won in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition, adding Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory has brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they often congratulated me later and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to take part in this competition.
You don't need to win right away, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that it would not have happened at all.
"I have regular business relationships with some people I have met thanks to the competition to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also reflected in each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is given to general recognition."
I also really do not see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only moved somewhere near to the fore," says LukáÃ3 Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a calmer year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has had the worst.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone company competition of the year in the last year was accepted by Karel Ã...árskÃ1⁄2, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury acknowledged the efforts with which he stomped out of the small toolmaking industry in Czech Skalice, a company that generates hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages myself, but also all my employees and encouraged our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state then offered a small workshop for lease to his father Karel ZarskÃ1⁄2 as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career rush in the company where he had been employed until then, and founded his father's own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades.
A short time later, they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it has also come to the consciousness of the non-profession.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to be able to work together with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, to attach greater value," says Karel Ã...árskÃ1⁄2.
The past year, however, was not only characterised by the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
The appreciation was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And it was precisely 2009 that was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at that time was even less shaking the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to hire their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not miss this situation."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," explains Karel Ã...árskÃ1⁄2
A viable company sometimes also has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black figures, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
The company was not willing to cut back on one - in investing in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, we encouraged our presentation at international trade fairs and earned main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says SárskÃ1⁄2.
Everything testifies to the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a more quiet atmosphere," says Karel Ã...árskÃ1⁄2 allows.
An opinion poll cleansed up with nonsensical rules
The opinion poll for the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already managed to make out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" became the duty to create documents on authorities available online.
More than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
The social security administration demanded a paper excerpt from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer demand any extracts from the commercial register during controls on social security payers," said SSZ Jana Buraová, spokeswoman of the spokesperson for the Ã...SSZ Jana BuraÃ3ová.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take a close look at all the rules and orders, to have to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to abolish the nonsensical ones.
This year, for the fourth time, this year is part of an entrepreneurial competition, which is held by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is being held and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder business activity.
"As for example, the number of income tax forms is concerned, we occupy a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlek from the Association of Small and Medium-Sidy-Order Companies and Tradesman of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business activities has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is taking the 74th in terms of corporate conditions. Rank one, compared to the previous year, a ranking which is worse off for eight places.
The competition absurdity of the year was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the closing date of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to register. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Anti-price" and lets the public vote on the Internet on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more than 105, more than 105 senseless regulations and orders have been registered for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, regulations are also that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to preside over every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening, in which personalities from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech. Republic and Petr Kuel, the President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce. Republic at the height of the competition.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs clubs between their legs, there can be no real economic boom, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today still make their activities unnecessarily more difficult for entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical arrangements are having an effect.
In 2007, people most disturbed the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the trade office at the site of their permanent establishment the intention to go to an exhibition stand or fair.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation to which the second largest number of votes received in 2007 - the duty to report to the employment office of business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was held by the law on them. "Green card" abolished.
And - all good things are three:
The absurdity of 2009 was chosen by the regulation, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat tempered by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation was eliminated.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's already fifth year's competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsibility-friendly company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the procurator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafon company of the year's main competition Vodafon company companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and would provide enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in relation to the subject of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about, for example, about handicapped people, because they are personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from PodÃbrady is also primarily concerned with its health-impaired employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which they were recognised with the title "Responsibility-conscious company of the Central Bohemia region"; in the Vodafone company of the year, it represented it in third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a fluid working time that was reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible in order to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurial activities and administration for the environment as low as possible," explains her managing director Miluse Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company enlogit from the region of Ã...stÃ1⁄2 nad Labem, on the other hand, is in the middle of the health of its employees, and therefore has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and it promotes homework with its employees and at corporate events, which is offered by a homely protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma communities," says OndÃoej SuchÃo, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "PranÃ3 a Ã...iÃ3tÃ3nÃ1⁄2" from the Karlovy Vary region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We grant our employees contributions to the food, the way they work, to increase their qualifications and for their holidays," says Josef StrapáÃ3 from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All district finalists of the Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered for the category Responsible Company of the Year, which answered the questions of the registration questioning and sent it to the organiser by August 15 at the latest.
Incorrectly or incompletely filled out in questioning were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible company of the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, since it is only a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Land Fund - Detention of the police in a public tender
In the building of the land fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrested in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate trader LuboÃ1⁄2 G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a current public competition to carry out restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition were to become a specific interested party.
This is said to have paid half a million.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person in a public competition because of the offence of fraudulent activities," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo", and cannot provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In view of the sparse of official information, one can only speculate about how he could manipulate public competition.
The spokeswoman for the floor fund LubomÃ3r Ã...erná referred to the question of Právo in this respect that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner subsidiary site of the land fund during public competition.
"It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to the public competition, the correct designation "Invitation to submit claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims, which are to be settled by the transfer, than within the challenged property value."
"In accordance with the offered claims, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the land fund transfers the land plot to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson for the fund.
LuboÃ3 G. were obviously available with information about those who had registered at the request and since he was a manager himself, since he had bought a number of claims for restitution, offered to a property interest that he retires from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
In the past, Lubo G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement restitutions, to which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, LuboÃ1⁄2 G. also acquired land from the land fund, for example, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access road to the Borské pole business park was planned.
Later he exchanged it very favorably with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to incur a small in heart in order not to endanger the building project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs are rising by several hundred months
From January, households not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and sewage charges and for district heating, and rents are also growing in some places.
From January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more out of their wallet than before.
Electricity will become more expensive to 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities it will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and sometimes the district heating supplies will be made more expensive.
The electricity costing alone costs the housing households a few hundred more crowns every year.
The high-current prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, and is therefore the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
Gas becomes only moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns are to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Especially larger locations are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating per month, and more than 1000 kroner more per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, are threatened by 9 percent higher water and sewage charges, and this in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, for which the so-called from January. Rental regulation is eliminated.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which has 2,500 apartments in Ã...stÃ1⁄2 nad Labem, plans to increase the rents by one hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to prosecute him in court.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in almost 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with distance and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Remote, rum and vodka, for once a good whisky, which you stole from the home bar.
These are the drinks, after the enjoyment of which drunk Czech teenagers have to be most frequently emergency treated among fifteen.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep in their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine is completely out of style because it simply takes too long to be drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo LudÃ3k Pelikán, head physician of the paediatric department in the Central Bohemian Clinic Hosovice.
"Whisky, if the father manages to steal a bottle from the house bar, and if not, at least remote or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage of being able to mix it with Juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the head doctor.
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"The most common is about distant or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, whom you took from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to head physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in the hospital admission.
He worked for ten years in the paediatric department of Motol Hospital, where he has been working for ten years in the paediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulance had drunk pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, when she was first committed to 3.5 per mille of alcohol in her blood and in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at some dance party in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice."
"The interesting thing about it was that her mother didn't feel strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when initiating with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not talking about real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all the associated phenomenon, and this is not the case with these children."
Those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly are usually characteristic of a negative family-social background," explains Pelikán head physician.
According to the speaker of the Motol hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine until mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospitalization, go into the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by the parents or, if applicable, by the police after outpatient treatment, are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink such a bottle of liquor in the school desk, according to Mr Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes, to which one hundred percent reliance: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for joy on holiday."
"During Walpurgis Night, I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the admission," stresses Dr Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better than a child who has only an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headache in the morning afterwards, which stems from dehydration and lack of glucose, can be expelled in hospital with a fluid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "gorgeous" experience in the evening, they awaken with a good mood without hurting anything anywhere."
"They are only a little confused about where they are," admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes at least causing the patient to spoiling the good mood by listing them the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because transport by ambulance and night in an acute bed comes to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"In and again, I used this as an educational tool when I directly evaluated the children during the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it can well happen that they have to work on the whole holidays in order to earn the money for a single fetus," PhD Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not rely on recourse proceedings to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunken children from their parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sets.
It is the first time that machines of this type have been owned by an alien army.
In the abroad, they have only been seen at maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still conserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the Omnipol company - has taken over them last week.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejek, who is not yet known when she physically expelled the planes from Vodochody.
The single-seated fighter aircraft L-159, on the other hand, was separated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's department.
"The double-seated L-159T1 were replaced in the current state and appearance," said Právo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater fighter aircraft, since in May 2009 the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody for the reconstruction of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter aircraft in the equipping of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of aircraft L-159 and that it should serve to train pilots from the NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the buyer how he realizes the matter," said Pejek.
The economic paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the Mirek Topolánek government.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not announced a tendering process for purchasing, but spoke directly to EADS.
The department at that time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 aircraft, of which it used only 24, and the rest wanted to sell it.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have selected the aircraft on the basis of an entirely European tender and by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring fingers are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, namely in men up to sixty," said Ros Eeles, co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should absolutely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health strains, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was as to 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men to sixty even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research showed that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav PaÃ3es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said this study is now known to him, but that he has not yet considered the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter service providers were on the road all night on the road.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 near Brno also stands in the direction of Prague.
This is what Novinky.CZ told the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (AMK).
At kilometre 91, a truck crashed, at kilometre 93 two trucks collapsed, injured in this accident.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems with kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have joined forces here too.
The riders were to leave 190 or drive over Brno at kilometre 182 and drive on at kilometre 182 at the town of KÃ3valka.
There are kilometres of jams.
An accident has also happened on the D11 and that immediately after the access to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed, for example, in the town of Prosek, and the street is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis unit meets.
There are also problems with the railway and on the airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven express train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Airport RuzynÃ1⁄2 is closed until 5am since Wednesday 11am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Three secondary roads are completely impassable around Vyskov, in the vicinity of Brno snow drifts are formed at times, and in the vicinity of Blansko it is forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is VÃ3kov.
Three streets are still completely closed there: Roussnov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kuserov and also Ã...aratice - MileÃovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will be used for snow removal.
When it can be passed again cannot be estimated so far.
In the Hodonin region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathian Mountains.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons may only be sprinkled with inert spreads, is a snow cover of up to five centimetres thick, led by Ã...TK.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most of all in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic it is slowly snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is previously only known as their code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in its favour.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate cannon.
Your projectiles will be directed into the finish by laser with an accuracy of only a few metres.
The special junks of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when they clash at the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
This means that it can be used against an enemy who is hidden behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fighting rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, he gains an exact sight point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he just needs to push it off.
"Let's say you've measured 543 metres."
"When you push, the weapon comes down and shoots the bullet at the distance of 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the previous office building on the Marienbad Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialising in computers and maintenance on Wednesday announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be laid down their workplace in July next year from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should still be accommodated another 100 jobs of the Group, which were previously distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in the Astro Park would also be better suited to the working methods of the employees.
Fujitsu was also only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The managing director of the responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance, especially for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday evoked joy with the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt citizen's economic director Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" was once again won.
This is a "great confession of location".
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on the Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons were the deciding factor.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house on Rathausplatz, which Fujitsu has been used so far, and the neighbouring "Small Verge" were one of the most controversial building projects in the spa town with the other buildings on the Marienbad Square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was built between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based German Real Estate Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consumer describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad moves in from Bad Homburg, and the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square metres were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - is based, among other things, the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depes.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
The Wikileaks reveal platform is becoming increasingly attacked in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the wanted lists of Interpol, is supposed to be in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks from Amazon servers are suppressed."
"Free speech in the land of the outdoors," the revelation activists said via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic cables, in order to handle the high number of views on the documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks explained to the step: "Great - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had investigated, CNN television channel reported on the Liebermans office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in the face of previous publication of clarified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be denied its use for servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," said a non-party senator's statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, and the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange was right to fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore keep hiding.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person in charge of the Wikileaks revelation be charged with betrayal and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - told on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a blow exchange arose between the White House and Assange.
President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently known espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're looking at a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, said the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after Wikileaks disclosure of the messaging of the messaging.
The White House also wants to have the ways in which the entire government is sharing and protecting information.
The American administration also announced that it wanted to ensure the security of dissidents and active parties if they were to be put at risk through the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Banio spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream pastors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From gelfish and jelly.
Gela animal, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream, makes cream according to all rules of Italian ice-making.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, swipes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But those who want to know more about ice cannot pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University was set up by the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entry and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare to ice their vague longings.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bage something of its own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro animals Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano doesn't forget the icing on the cake of the national and southern general in general: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a tap on the machine, and outcomes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all kinds of milk ice.
The lecturer is immediately ascertained with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one let your own experimental desire run wild?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it slumps together, and the customer bites on sheer ice grains.
Certain variations on the matrix are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or from the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavoured additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either at the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with the ice cream made of the white matrix, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder the basis for all sorts of chocolate seducements.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano each has four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the matrix, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit pureness - taste this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste less than if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice makes the working group, which uses more fruits, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture properly speaks out the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calishing task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is necessary.
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers use it to measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables facilitate computer wing.
Making ice cream does not require as much physical effort as it used to be.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the matrix.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to sub-zero temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo smells his way and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized handbreader gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like this happens."
Inspectors in the teeth
The European food authority Efsa is infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobby association Ilsi for years.
This is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the Efsa test regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa regulations are identical in paragraphs with position papers of the si and thus bear the signature of industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech has been criticised by a conflict of interests.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager was most recently unconditional or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had thus changed sides.
Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU Parliamentary awareness.
However, Efsa cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
Apply to all reputable data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is said in a statement.
The experts working on Efsa do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mission.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently being approved in animals without any feeding trial and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what genetically modified maize is doing on the field, for example," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?", Then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck also sees it.
The scientist has been conducting research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is now trying more and more to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
As a rule, critical studies are not published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has also provided some of them, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It snowed.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to a stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not go away."
He raves: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and grounding."
When he sawed one up, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought all those who were attacked in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame to be ground to gravel or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden jack, which was once a guard house.
He was cursed and threatened, he was told when he was in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it happened, it would be the most reasonable if the stones were used further.
Around 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the cuboids weighing an average of 80 kilos, with each unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also some in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscaped gardeners, house builders.
They came from everywhere and had carried away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the kick have long since turned into "makers" or into boundaries of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets on his 4x4 and makes a tour through his 20 hectare empire.
He studied law and aborted, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
He carries his treasures together from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest old stone trader in the Republic.
It slows down.
In the snow are artfully hewn sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, it swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And further.
"Beautiful travertine."
The quadriers once belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, Cannstatter traverstor from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hewn by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not stone.
But the stone merchant employs 14 people today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass player and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual user.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent fight for high-potentials
There is a number of crowds at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to talk shop together with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are courted by others.
And because the universities do not provide any constellations about the achievements of their students, the exception talents are being tried to please and bind themselves in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is taking turn to the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bearers and folders with VW logo.
It tells the hopeful young talents of internship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways to join the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is supervising the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and think about who would be considered as an employee."
Such cooperations, Selle said, are not uncommon.
What is new that the students are so offensive.
"Otherwise the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for the new graduates will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
They must promote themselves and especially skillfully around highly qualified workers.
Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineer gap will become even greater.
Roman Dykta is looking for a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which participants have to find their way based on GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
By the way, the participants can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Anyone who is allowed to do decide in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the cream of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when the high potentials at the universities are taking place and stinging around the high potentials.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be ready.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are about to be completed and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct choice on campus, small and medium-sized companies are also stalking very classically at vocational fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, HR Manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company has around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young talent.
There are currently 35 positions advertised on the company website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not popular with the solar specialist.
The company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"This is often not possible for a large corporation," says HR Manager Stübe.
Money does not play the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are further decisive factors.
Solarworld attended a study by the Great Place to Work Institute 55. Place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute creates an annual leaderboard of German employers.
They ask employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for the employees.
HR Manager Stübe also hopes that the placement will also have advantages for job seekers.
"I think that applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy consults companies who want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer leads through his own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would advertise their employer with friends and acquaintances all by themselves.
"It's like a game with gang," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government has issued a corresponding ban in Washington - and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
New drilling is also banned off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The advocates want to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Anyone who bears responsibility for the devastating oil platform in the Gulf has not yet been clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of dollars.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is intended to present their results in the course of December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe with sharper controls and stricter security regulations.
The competent supervisory authority, which was disaughtered after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that it would close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
Industry now publicly warns that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't fall off," the eco-activist calms down the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to the breast in the water with the surrounding streaks: in the rainbow-coloured watery shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not visible that brown crude swives are floating beneath the surface.
She used to collect shrimp here, Esther Badom tells the story of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, vast amounts of crude oil poured out of a burst pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-built waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise out of the ground like black lice stickers, sadly let palms found their fronds hang their fronds.
Swarms of birds, as they are usual in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the outboard remains silent, ghostly calm spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinister: "We are living in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battlefield that has been contested for decades: the first explorers from Europe emerged here more than 60 years ago, where the first resistance was absorbed in the 1980s with the later executive writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still denied the return to Ogoniland today: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of the threefold size of Switzerland with over 5,000 drill sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the company is located too unstable.
Every few hundred metres, steel racks rise like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the boreholes far too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corrode into the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have gone into the ecosystem of the Delta in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil, as penetrated into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the event of the "Exxon Valdez" accident - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Anyone who is to be blamed for the continuing eco-giant will be disputed.
While the Shell group holds sabotage and the organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leak pipelines as the main polluter.
Shell imposes significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008 that the rate of defects on the leads alone is "a multiples higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-stained workshop under the open sky, shapes appear from the mangroves: they are naked and smeared up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
At first, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collection pot, later drilled out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel x 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still beat the diesel price, which is almost 40 euro cents per litre, ridiculously low: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkerers" who tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil daily in this way.
However, only a tiny portion of the provisionally intersulted raw material is being illegally refined: the lion's share fill organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tankers and swallow it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more due to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production is considered by the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell, especially to Shell, is so destroyed that only one withdrawal of the company would be possible: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese turn out to be better."
Michael gets nervous.
"Highest time you disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil finishers are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but they are threatened with a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who are primarily from the Land order, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damned stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction faults in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error during the investigation of an emergency landed aircraft that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency landed Qantas-Airbus appear to have had much more fortunate than previously known: The Australian aviation security agency has identified a major security problem for the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in a statement by the ATSB authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
The affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Below is the Qantas-Airbus, which is on the 4. November in Singapore had to make an emergency landing.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed an grounds of a lawsuit at an Australian federal court in Sydney, which will allow him further legal action against the company.
Qantas head Alan Joyce said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had come loose and the wings had damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide have to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily lowered about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa switched off the engine as a precaution on an A380.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Land-wide snowfall releases traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow has fallen overnight almost all over the country.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights are coming out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
The winter is frosting Germany: In icy temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowing on Thursday during the night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east are sometimes 15 centimetres thick snow covers.
Traffic is severely limited on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, winter service was in continuous use, but the constantly newly blown up snow was not finished.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) awaits storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, the snowdrifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the storm centre Meteomedia, alarm level was therefore violently in Saxony - the highest level ever.
Sometimes 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars got stuck there that night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stalling traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are considerable disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance services from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be suspended.
In Saalfeld in the Thuringian city of an ICE to Munich had to stop his journey.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the roads.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cuts.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is on permanent use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 camp beds available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a railway crossing in Ostholstein while collapsing with a train.
The train driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was hit on a level crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had rolled over her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
The meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore whirl up on slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - down to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters nice: the twin storms in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to get the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" citing a spokesperson writes.
The speaker did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties themselves and then rent back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest bank is giving its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the twin towers from the investors of an in-house fund for 272 million euros in mid-2007 and then extensively renovated it.
The energy conversion devoured the figures according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper's towers, which have now been renamed "Greentowers", to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands of mourning dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth had a violent explosion.
Twenty-five hundred and 62 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no emergency services could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies have not been able to be recovered so far.
Now, relatives and friends remember the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddles were to be seen.
Pictures and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were blowing at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
At the first explosion on the 19th century. In November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, they start to cool down the annealing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit to art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and laps his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use violent killing methods and once his enemies tears the intestines out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, how it is actually called does not say the whole film about a word, and the other characters also let themselves be carried away at most to one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries.
Otherwise, they kept silent and scorched in the creepy hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the Viking world with the screaming of the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineastes with interest for existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, only harm if they are mutually exclusive.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works more humour accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema friends should be deterred by the shattering brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die at the latest before boredom when an Eye breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem for freely interpretable reasons and stuck in an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema distribution in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because the pretentious to blood-like facade hides an sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent plot, it is all atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
And there is no escape for the audience.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly laces him down his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands faithfully by side keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior of hell for enemies and temporarily allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means blurring, but perhaps only for the already corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoyance, excitement and marvel.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is refraining from taking a stand - it is still allowing controls.
Around midnight from the 5th to the 6th. In September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has supposedly built in the cuboid with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that departs from the river.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence service CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, which is also common under the name of the nearby locality el-Kibar, would have been well suited to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Per computer animation, she blinded where what components of the reactor were said to have been before the destruction was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
She also presented photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was standing shortly before commissioning, it was said, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly known more than then, yes, the puzzles grew rather larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret services members in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "pliev".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered in the summer only succinctly that the IAEA "had material to ask questions."
The Syrians hurriedly set aside the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen took tracks of uranium that had been produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite imagery from commercial providers through a member state immediately after the attack, which were said to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these shots cannot be received on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always asserted that he has never pursued a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, this was the IAEA rejected as unlikely after the analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in attack at the time of the attack, recently.
The investigation of the case has been dragging itself down since June 2008 and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is guarding over.
The IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike this still exist, the key to advances in the Enlightenment.
The inspectors have not yet disclosed which plants they are, nor what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to in the IAEA as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis has identified these places and identified a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or next to a military base - it is precisely on this ground that the IAEA does not allow the IAEA to access the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the USA to spy off military facilities.
The nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three towns and the block on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was to be separated from it later, there are at best plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of lorryloads had disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the debris has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, which was located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had demanded access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months later to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
If Western diplomats had appeased a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has no urgency, for example US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA is needed for it, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but allowed to escalate.
On the other hand, how a diplomat points out: "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the screenplay herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that is enough for unrest.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, is stubbornly falling in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women's labor forces have protested immediately, after which some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organisation of female war victims wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador to the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she once offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tell her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organisation has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her screenplay to read, gave a shooting permission for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has incorporated herself into the Yugoslavia conflict with great difficulty, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all participating sides.
However, it remains vague in the content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulated on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other in them even before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different from the "rape victims fall into torturer".
That Jolie's film actually begins before the war - that's certain.
According to Jolie, the pressure on them is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can make peace for her: by putting the script, as so many before, illegally online.
Nothing like away here
This evening it is finally going really round for the Irish.
No trace of sorrow.
To this end, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cry with lots of music with crashing loud music, they stomp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Irish, is shaking - and meet table tennis balls over a three-metre distance - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, there is 500 Euro victory premium plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist who doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, to distract himself from the piercing question of what the future will bring.
On his plan is not fun to play in Las Vegas, he will hold job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling with me," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerki, wake up her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Two of Tanners' three siblings have already sought their luck abroad because of bad prospects at home.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The young go: As with the Tanners, it looks like the island in many families.
Experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin predict that they will be leaving the country in the near future.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a severe loss.
If the forecasts were preserved, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered from in the eighties.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, draughts is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettled by the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has so far only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are letters to the editor of young emigrants who complain: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country is losing an entire generation."
"The last then please make the light out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future winding up because the government is only weighing eyes and no longer offers young people any future prospects.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students shimmy from an unpaid internship to the next.
She says her biggest concern, she says, be it to have to emigrate herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on working abroad.
"For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known how it feels to build something elsewhere for six months.
Because there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just pulling up a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland now only rarely, because he makes extra layers in order to be able to pay the loan for his house home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I deserve money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am hardly ever more."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed credit.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pour after hot tea and says, "I have no children to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he often hears at the moment.
"Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll only feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just look at how it goes with life elsewhere.
He has already done a few years of work in London and why shouldn't it go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still there that worries him in these days: the celebration of his 27. Birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Do not eat too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"By well, that sounds frightening."
"We'd rather have a way-to-be take away, very relaxed, with some friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democatian routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is supporting private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the results of the Latinobar survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In numerous countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see see see). Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been around approx. 6% grows, the number of pro-demand prospects increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp slump last year.
But only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (s. Diagram 2).
Ca. 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice. That's as many as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% of its government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to achieve more democracy.
The fact that this has also continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen by 32% again this year.)
But there are strong differences in sentiment from country to country (see see). Map 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been felt more strongly and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country a major problem than in unemployment (see paragraphs). Diagram 5).
Ca. 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: approx. 71% of respondents said that the private sector is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (s. Diagram 6).
Ca. 58% said that only the market economy can make progress to their land, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela respondents have maintained this view (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the USA, with Venezuela being taken on by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election slipper
Nobody expected the elections on 28. November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the election workers who rushed to the help of the land.
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, polling cards in the edge stone, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Electives opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the January earthquake, roamed the way in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the lifting of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election "as quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities do not necessarily invalidate the process, however serious they may be."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, alleged to the irrepleent president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is committed to the preliminary results on the 7th edition of the vote. December announce.
The expected runoff election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who is only little or no approval among the voters, declares the winner of the run-off election from the election directors, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organisation.
Just before the election started were approx. 250,000 cards required for election have not yet been distributed.
There is a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly to the center
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest figure since its election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to steering economic policy even after the election of his wife, often set up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27. October led to further disagreements.
Some critics of the regime's ranks of the ruling Peronists were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian slapped another and others accused the government of bribery) did not succeed in adopting the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget now also applies to next year, which gives the President even more opportunities to spend money at its own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to its main goals, not inflation cut.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleansed the National Institute for Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently beautiful the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
It has called on the private sector and the union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, the inflation spurt the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to connect Argentina back to the rest of the world in a financially economic term.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with security holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to press for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which they have approx. Ã...6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer award index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathetic that was shown to her will be blown.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she cancels many of her husband's political decisions quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the Strait?
On the 27th More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and councillors in the five municipalities. This is considered a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only scarce.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has been around approx. 8% fallen.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual incidents in Taiwan were caused by truck convoys with rioters, bulk moving flags and only spicy dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man shot from the crowd in his face. Lien was wounded and a standing spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the election and put the DPP in a poor light, which has brought more votes to the KMT.
It is possible that China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time also avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much to be fomented.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of his policy to China.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration. But the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's regency, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as the presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is doing everything it can to show that it too is capable of establishing close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas premature rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry with this change.
From his cell, he said that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever more shattering between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet and the local facilities.
The strong occurrence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only fully supporting rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you occur at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony for the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been repeatedly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual. But it corresponds to the Grammy Rules, according to which an artist is allowed to have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album, with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her lively voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success comes closest in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of the Spalding Nomination.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category Instrumental Albums. This favourite of the critics experienced a huge success.
The competitors Iyers include among others. "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbed favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where other albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are more like to be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category. He thus compete against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a Democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award includes a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra is headed by five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A. composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated in the category of classical music producers this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical music albums are Bruckner's No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg nominated for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was born on the 4th. January at Disney Hall of the L.A. Philharmoniker conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen premiered and recorded.
The approx. 30-minute play is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of the works of Stravinsky with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and the principal Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vooolistists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category classical crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to the Commission said on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're only very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting started at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides spread fairly evenly according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There's no more America," was a comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at an end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on 11. September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
Its community with approx. 135 families have lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque is said to have two minarets and about 13m high.
It is said to be on the approx. 17,500 m2 of land on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species, which can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered essential to be obtained up to now.
"This organism has two options."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it very special, even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake, California, continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists have to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study looks at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of discovery of extraterrestrial life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can use other elements to set biochemical processes in motion and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at Milton Keynes Open University in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, chose Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, it assumed that microbes that are subjected to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is primarily based on the fact that it behaves chemically in a similar way to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It reaches our biochemical system, where it virtually smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adjusted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or on a other planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, is not new to the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic. But there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early earth years, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early gear age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen show dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday's Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well advanced," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide exact information about the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still underway."
"We don't want to say more," explains Whitmore.
"We follow some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were uninjured, according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's almost one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They frequently stay in motels and park their vans in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them in her motel room.
The thick-skin Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised a finder's reward to anyone who could give a reference to the corgis. The animals were implanted for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage is paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got the green light for a new beginning.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepare" peeer plan to repay the debt of 5 billion dollars and pave the way for new films and television shows for the 86-year entertainment company.
According to Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcies law, so that nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat slopped-down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees is covered by more than 400 to approx. 320 lowered.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually comes into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a proposed bond of 500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself is bringing in a cash prize of 75 million, is leading the company. The financing is expected to be held by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the contract to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, which was fighting with interest payments of 300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve the financial concerns of MGM and pay the more than 140 plunders of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company to buy at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the creditors the Ã...2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started over when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which have already received a cash consideration of 1.2 million, amounts to €9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly to the management of the company, will receive a "success bonus" of €4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only released one film and created an annual schedule with seven or eight films, which are to be released in early 2012.
Furthermore, they are planning two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between 265 million and two million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who approx. 18% of the MGM loan has financed, attempted a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for a cash prize of €99, while the price of a Kinect game will cost about 10 classic jumping ropes or approx. 48 cans Play-Doh equals.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three national toy dealers in the city of 80 - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less at the same time than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own website appear, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, there is a wider offer.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all the prices of Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, '13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as large as guinea pigs singing a note when you press on her stomach.
Once press a note corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you cannot stop.
For a combination of messenger and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price 60, for children starting from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic puppet offers interchangeable games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge foot with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphee, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, Ã...40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with a drive to become a lesson, with a know-it-all with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech (€60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as the one on the Leapster Explorer (No.70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price (€90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash (No.30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about merging the blocks to words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go after the offer in the toy stores alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online tier in the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" mix 'N Match figure packet (5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle beast.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano (10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves rapidly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It is fun to send it through a maze of blocks.
And he can do some things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived in the mouth of our dog for some time.
Police Operations in China Become Genter
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin moved over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates, and issued orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the city order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the spectators.
"It's worth it!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely outgrown the teenage, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight row.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
"They look average for me," Mr. Tang remarks slightly disdainous.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced force with Niederstarrens: In 2009, according to reports, 50 officials orbited an imbis car that was not properly placed and stared at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the court.
Xindu, a municipality in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the city police patrol. They were specially chosen because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
By right, said the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce the city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his mobile phone, how they completed a protest action against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a scuffle of the hand with five officials.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China during an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government," the national newspaper China Daily said last year, following further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "real thorough purge".
Sceptics are sceptical to the current approach to be significantly inadequate.
When the distrik was looking for eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or should only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to a job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonious facial features".
You should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when the 26th reached the reaches of Year age.
According to officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically strenuous.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their outward appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they have other duties beyond."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district city administration, does not want to agree with this description,
suggested, however, that in China size specifications in job postings are not uncommon for both genders.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical distortions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or hunchback here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patroling on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple sticks and a well-formed mouth.
She does not find it sexist that so much emphasis is placed on her looks.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their figures, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply scare merchants through the streets to stop them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many buns and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please disappear here."
"We have told you so many times that!" explains Frl. Xu, a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily stabbed his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the civilian women, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
"It's the same almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superior.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, after the rumour circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials rocked this morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a fierce face and continued their motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, was left behind. He turned his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we proceed verbally."
"Sometimes also physically," explains Mr. Li nonder.
"Most of the time people start to argue."
Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
The Senator's lawyers announced after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to lobby her husband, Senator Ensignsacks of the allegation.
This decision ends the most serious charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Until the scandal that made headlines nationwide and smashered his career, he was considered a potential presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, the Ministry of Justice has informed them that the investigation against Senator Ensign has been stopped and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethic lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has disregarded the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, which were first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, helped one of his election workers to buy lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during an Ensigns campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get a job with Hampton. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying work for them after the closure.
Since Hampton was still in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbies.
According to the published indications, "it appears to be an agreement and violated the revolving door statue," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are targeted by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethicists, the ministry, seems very cautious in recording political charges after a number of defeats persecuted with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrifying," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington," a group of lawyers who seek various charges against Mr. Ensign brought to court.
"In principle, this means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign said in an interview that he had received a prosecutor's phone call on Monday and another the next day, in which he was told that the ministry would not bring any complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated again in a statement on Wednesday, had "traded in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I don't probably go into the details of the discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only that much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission has decided to close the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of Ã...96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to whom Hamptons had violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has moved on, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had taught him that he "tangles" at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, arranged for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had hired lobbying.
When information about this affair reached the public for the first time last year, Mr. Ensign with his voters and abandoned his position in the Senate, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican ranking.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. told. Ensign two weeks ago reporters, which he wanted a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer being the target of police investigation, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, who said, said the senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly follows the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calling attracts attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tap into the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent their reports of gruesome testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter notifications about the process of raping and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, come to an official end when the judgment of the death sentence expressed by the jury falls.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed claims to the court, set out the grounds for an appeal and which will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and such an immediate penetration of sorberic details, including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters, has occurred, so that the jury was influenced in an unamitting way by the public indignation.
This appeal could lead the appeal courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies make new rules in the courtroom necessary.
"As I experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Court of Appeals last week rejected the applications briefly and succinctly by decision when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court sayings have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In its historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States issued the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections, which Mr. Hayes’s sentence a half century later considered, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to keep the communication routes from the courtroom at the time of the case Dr. Sheppard was still unimaginable, to regulate.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting an immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who have been the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defense attorneys, for example, also claim that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrible crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the judges have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their accomplished Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had fulfilled them with disgust.
The defence lawyers say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who was a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had unduly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to free the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the campaign for the office of governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"A such daily rush of media puzzles, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "one has not been experienced in New Haven and maybe even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter's coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were more incendiary than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly was an anti-technical view that impedes reporting on future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes were required of the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the coverage and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "representates Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st. century."
Can courtesy combine the dividing thing?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little politeness broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning to the fight of the parties in the capital quickly?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and leaders of Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the big questions to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the session at the end of a period of government in which no more decisions are made.
After all that you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor to govern a observance of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point collecting.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
That is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other demands a sign of the willingness to cooperate and compromise, while oneself tries to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment were limited by the participants to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to be expected to see a rapid change in the atmosphere that has been forecast in the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November election Washington voted in a mild manner for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone of voice has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even everyone, whether temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it is believed that the favoured tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112. Congress in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-agreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - leading to courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see many things that will happen from today until 2012, as a preliminary struggle or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, who served as their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be to poker, they know they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions regarding the recommendations of the Decverage Commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the increase in the retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
Deputy chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have urged the deficit issue to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored anymore.
But within the Commission they need 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan the official recommendation and they are fighting very much to even reach this figure.
The greatest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the body, since there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise on financial matters, at least today.
Galston foreshadows two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first struggle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and health system, followed later by a period of major two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public Opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, both parties must carefully pay attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanness and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological divide between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far-reaching election in 2012.
Seen in this way, the courtesy that is shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "peptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimized businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the ladder is migrating upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on its homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that in the meantime would have been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption charges for years, and he has won numerous slander complaints against such accusations.
In September, he declared a Russian TV channel when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This is what surveys have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocracy than a government," says Memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Authority (MVD) and the public prosecutor's office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"The ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors on the lowest stage are following the latest."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it says, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to obtain protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will be very modest not; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of a commission of Moscow, in an interview recently.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without any opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
The country, as estimated, by, corruption costs Russia more than 300 billion dollars a year.
The country ranks 154th place in a newer study of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed by "very least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which occurred after Moscow late in the evening, will certainly provoke displeasure within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to say that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded angrily to the revelation that American diplomats had called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to be shamed with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an ethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confronting the Past
In a dimly lit, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man who built it, later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges that have developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-time supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to confront the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia was the first time condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, complicating their efforts towards reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that explored the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, overwork or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, the regime's remnants and his military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here, until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, they spread unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overflow to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the gruelling poverty of rural Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they lay down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also roused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The mandate of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further action beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in the Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told commissioners of the Cambodian documentation centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers presumably died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the withered grass Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to load her up, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discussed this.
"Camboja has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, Chhang Youk from the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that you can understand like everything."
The center created the first government-approved textbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How many times in Cambodia do young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path stretched overgrown by shrubs and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire heap.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone saleswoman by the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Soda's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she would put down a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to accumulate not further weapons uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be gathering highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in an additional article of the Security Summit in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Secretary of State Sergei Martynov.
The US government had spent years trying to persuade Belarus to collect no more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But the US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" from Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised to secure all precarious nuclear material in four years in Prague.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Nevertheless, Belarus approached the USA a few months ago, when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove uranium of Belarus in October was especially complicated because the material was easily contaminated, say officials.
It was loaded into a special train, which more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials.
The second attempt was made on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officials.
The US government is paying 14 million dollars for these efforts, with much of the money going into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely cautiously coordinated and voted to build trust" leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, working on the Global Reduction of Threatening.
The James Martin Center for Unreading Studies says that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-hours of uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp till 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the USA were tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcome the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections of the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected by the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and redirected to the daily newspaper "El Pais" (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Government Head, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, called for the Spanish government to be informed of "to prove that foreign planes fly over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the assistance was charged with human rights-fading practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, were discussed, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President admitted that the Council's report "had hit Zapatero on the sidelines" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain did not object to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so that "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention, even though the government has little influence, since they were in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the embassy in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal with discreet governance between governments," says Aguirre.
At lunch in March 2007, when the US ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly concerned about their independence and do what they think appropriate," he gave his staff instructions to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to let the tension s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations will capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he stresses.
The child murderer confesses that she complained to the Internet about the "Mühsal" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
MÃ3nica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she keeps from age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Corua, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know her love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman had a relationship with Iván TÃ3ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was about him, but his former never had him performed a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she had another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one remained with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love affair broke up and they separated.
In March 2008 she wrote alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and sour, because I have come here to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not being free, being able to do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she has just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like to leave the boy with my mother, I will take him away when I am back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "This week I'll go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine a job on the 20th, if I don't want to lose them."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone except my mother," a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th was dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, but not."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer class, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17: Memories and lamentations.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me any videos to the email. You see, if he wants, he finds me, such a crap."
On the 30th one more thing: "The boy is doing well. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
There is one of VÃ3ctor, her current partner: "He is shooting money for me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison release".
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting supervisor, declares to have remorse because he felt guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
MÃ Â was transferred yesterday from the centre of prison for court prison in Menorca to the prison of Palma.
The defence lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of the facts, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
However, she had previously stood the drowning party in the bathtub and had stowed his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28. The PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona in November
After the important increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking back on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 6,4073 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 3126,22 in the regional elections in 2006.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this ascending trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC share of the vote and the retention of the PP electorate - if this trend continues, PP analysts predict that in parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU four (she now has 10) would win over and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (out 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose a deputy - currently has three - while ICV could hold its MP or win one to it.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue in the scales to put an end to socialist supremacy, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists can neither achieve a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
The People's Party has also seen significant growth in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and strives to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell caused Al Qaeda to do thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police from the police from the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadi cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba " (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay, which demanded 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that with "Operation Kampai" the forgery Al Qaedas has been "weakened" worldwide and "with their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were fake and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impeccable.
The cell uncovered is not the only jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation besides the Thai investigative bodies. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the EU territory in the coming days as the one that was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was held in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai people Sirikan.
They had headed the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been wiped out in 2009 - especially tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents in the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45 had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
Investigation circles underline the fact that no connections between those taken in Catalonia and the assassination attempt in Bombay have been detected until now, although the author of this assassination, was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a money transfer company a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP demands that Mas return the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas her terms and conditions in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already placed during the election campaign and can be summarised with the priority of the economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, like a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party certainly turned to Artur Mas, who awarded her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU depends on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to form in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the party leaders of the PPC are concerned, they demand that in support of the inauguration of "all discourses concerning Catalonia's sovereignty and independence" and an agreement on the financial equalisation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to subject a referendum, to be put on.
What both political leaders have in common is that they want to make the established political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the access of Mas are concerned by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan PuigcercÃ3s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaitat Catalana).
The nursing home reiterates that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the retirement home in Olot do not rule out that their caretaker killed over eleven elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage what the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse, who had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his work - had caused the establishment.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Canada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to indict the persons responsible (for the deaths)," but "the right and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation because it did not establish the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was due to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were carried out on the basis of their age and illnesses by telephone.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point and explained that "no possible action could not have been the reason for the incidents at all time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the lawsuit there is no evidence of negligent acts of anyone other than the accused."
The baptized baptized as "death angel" yesterday had eleven murders and declared that the first crime on the 29th day. In August 2009, one and a month and a half later the second old lady murdered.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that it is difficult to control the staff's access to the medication.
The insulin injection and the sedative cocktail was used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to rid the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will highlight whether Vila is lying and actually choosing a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it out from within by giving them bleaching water, as he had done according to confession in three women, whom he had done according to confessions, which he had done between the 12th and 17th. October murdered.
In La Caritat one does not believe the statements of the nurse, not even in the number of suffered murders, which could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change its approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded strongly yesterday to ECB President Trichet's threat, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk premiums of the euro peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has hardly paid at points, which is causing concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB must back withdraw for the fourth time tomorrow in two years, and probably a number of times in the future.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan be published to buy sovereign debt, as they were ineffective, as well as the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one-week indefinite access should be retained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and maintain quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to purchase bonds to continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back and if stubbornly it is insisted that we can withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the bank reaffirmed not to consider the purchase of sovereign debt and the markets then collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, thus provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government asset management spent only 500 million 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt gap were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and another 15 000 possible. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it failed to recognise the issue of the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary approval to its new budget next Tuesday. Since it still does not have sufficient assistance, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has her discourse on the summit of heads of state and government on 14th. December more moderate. Political unity is required there to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish President yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, dismantling the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound investors' ears like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are focusing on strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our resilience.
For Spain, applying for an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would not get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife: "Now not only being, but also appearances count."
Only courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the chairman of the board of Eulen will contact the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in open conflict of the Alvart family, owners of the companies owls and El Enebro, do not slack.
David Alvarez, founder of the company's gurpp, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th place at the request of five of his seven children, since he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Alvarez and his children, JesÃos David and Maria José, are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest business services holding does not seem to be prepared to give in to his litigation to control the organs of El Enebro.
The Board of Directors drives out of five of his seven children. These appointed themselves at the shareholders' meeting of 18. January of this year, which is already registered in the commercial register as contested, to members of the Board of Directors.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which was convened for the 16th by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid, has triggered a new thunderbolt in the womb of the Ã...lvarez family.
The appeal of the judge to arrange the meeting is the only legal route that ensures the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Alvarrez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to be interpreted by means of legal subtleties, fraudulent activities and abuse of rights the annully declared assembly of the 18. to have recognized January," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the contestation of the assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists who wrap themselves in discreet silence tried unsuccessfully in June to convene an assembly in a judicial way.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Alvarez control seven children 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital according to the family protocols.
This is the real background of the thing that the judge has to decide in the hearing on the handling of the action for the action for which no date has been set yet.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
At first, nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, everyone relied on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari at last November at the final sprint.
Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, there is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched on the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car racing.
This computer science program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to achieve faithful reproduction or Simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industry department at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing teams, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, the Red Bulls team employs 180 highly skilled young people. With powerful computer systems, they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to a reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
There are two buildings in which visits - especially journalists - are strongly limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation on the race tracks are concealed by other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
The plant's technologist, Steve Nevey, stresses that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in R&D for racing cars competed with 50 percent to victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the proportions have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of its success, while the pilots' contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by IT, because they "are not predictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores, each 80 to 100 square metres, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, cited as an example of the converted shop at the Gran Via in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the coming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The deputy chairwoman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of store opening is always the same. It rely on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and handles exclusive shops (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training the store staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network intended to "optimise customer service and the advice of small and micro-enterprises when shopping and then, and even packaging," even packaging, is intended."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP equipment with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed in particular for small and micro enterprises and private customers, as the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'curl" a million customers into three years
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foreshadows a slump in the interest margins that banks are trying to compensate with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - an even more existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to take full advantage of the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year flagship plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers who will lose the bank. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because so far it has given its business customers more attention than its private customers.
This year, it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. It will present the challenges facing the Bank, together with the annual accounts report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, since the financial crisis around the world's banks have confusion.
Sabadell will complete its Optima pilothouse, which was established four years ago, this year. This was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by a financial year.
The customers who are leaving the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only come out of the crisis "slowly".
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will be thawed, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity will already be passed on the price of loans as a compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn off the tap, but the interest spread teens are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increasing the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco DÃas from 22 and 27th November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently following the stategie "to increase the fees," but "within a competition framework ".
Sabadel's guard plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that "larger companies are needed in Spain."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increases" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slide into red numbers.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of capital fee.
Having assured that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he is refuting the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be circulated, but in contrast to the incidents in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo transactions and thus the crisis can be intercepted.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that there could be a wave of fusions of the savings banks and emphasised the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase. They kept the second round.
On the other hand, the general director of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca CÃ3vica cannot be regarded as a second round, but they were adjustment."
"The largest part is complete. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of sieveze, but all the important processes are already accomplished. They were controlled by Banco de Espana, which has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "has been completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiry, which in earlier times, has not now been defined as part of the business plans with Banco de Espana," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he emphasised.
Olavarrieta explained, "there are a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process of dionsent and nonsense," because "Banco de EspaÃa urges us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world and added that those who doubted this would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic activity we have to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which is "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very well passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the Euro's retention, but at the same time established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and small businesses, regulating temporary employment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros for the unemployed, who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had evoked the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is starting to specululate over three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by much of public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population.
The third party: a redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of countries that exceed the targets; more possible way the cessation of the payments of some countries and the increase in the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been looming for some time. Therefore there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provided incentives for deficits and the German government moved out of its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of drifting apart between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal was the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At that time, this was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel will come out with a clear position again in the last days of October. It calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it drove the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was accepted. In the next few months, we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross it.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures are needed now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer be possible from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the contrary countries will be severely penalised, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to pursue a tough growth path, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive foreign economic balances.
The other alternative based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has set herself ready.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like something would change.
Among the possibilities under consideration, it cannot be excluded that we would have to leave the euro area, which is fully stuffed with less reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and control bypass
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion instigated by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated in the game of 23. November against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed, whether it was an unsporting action or not, and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction at the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules, but in this sport.
Part of the occasional debate about the case presented goes back to the fact that a team from the Real Madrid football club (who insisted in his anthem nobleness and honour and had punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the leading role, and the dramatisation by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provoking technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are a circumvention of rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to be avoided.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the contrary players from taking an unjustified benefit from the counter team. That did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand by misplay or perversion of the rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly accomplished in order to avoid a sanction, but should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the sanction happily.
Another question is what kind of advantage the contractors drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized that the rival was neither brought into a more unfavourable location nor advantages for the game played were recognised, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually leave. In addition, players receive a sanction with this approach and pass into the second cycle of cards, in which they exclude less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
This does not make it so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions to make the greatest possible benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of a circumstance), they wanted to choose when they would undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing from it.
Although the line between the inventiveness and the rules environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic was created as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusion and because of the type of rule transmission.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is less more ethical than an aesthetic.
Customer fishing for Group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves an avalanche of reservations on days 16 and 17 this year. December fall.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the TurrÃ3n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, which provide oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the large mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on a lunch or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations surveyed.
To make the accounting even more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve) has all orders in the week from 13th to be found in the week of 13. Drop December, with the result of an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top daymakers (of the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have suspended group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economy, lowest prices are demanded, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant body, GaietÃ FarrÃ3s.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People are thinking about it 'ten times before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they pay attention to the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "send the quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are the most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey at various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of the 17th city. Decembers the provider leads to collapse.
The Soteras group says the questions for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros are booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led to the peculiarities of the calendar to arrange reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible possible to maintain last year's prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which directs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 restaurants, the optimism is not lost after revenues have flourished since the second quarter and good ones, albeit a few days of concentrated prospects for the Christmas business, are not lost.
Sources of the group of companies also highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends who were coming forward to Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than price hit has been added to the six group menus. One gets the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back on the upswing.
From the side of the Fecasarm umbrella organization (with mergers such as the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric GomÃ, entrusts to see the end of the tunnel and notice that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although customers "suggest a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not decreased, no matter who pays.
Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
In the margins of clarifying and juicy details, which provide the documents about the content of the conversations and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary "takes off" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhytmus than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not put together, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - do Washington provide sleepless nights.
The following risks counts the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, to: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed scattering of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people who are implied in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered only by the US, but also by Russia to be an exhaustive and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire strictly believing personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to re-duck individuals working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is declining in terms of nuclear distribution and the increased pace in which Pakistan is making nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declares: "Frequently there is no transparency; we do not receive answers on offers of help or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe Pakistan, it confirms that "though the economic catastrophe Pakistan produces nuclear weapons more quickly than any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear" to the person responsible that "Pakistan's army must stop its tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a senior leader in the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning to the persecution and finding of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "find and persecution" from Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, it is not new, it dates from the 20th. November.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "promises that the police would know where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities have been received.
That's how things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are dependent on identifying and locating Assange "to temporarily arrest and deliver it."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organisation, consider the red warning to be a carte blanche for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be.
The approach outraged Assange's lawyers who published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also remind you that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and compared with the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin, received the appropriate permission.
"It's like a hunt, not like legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world seeks him - and his mother of Australia asserts him out of the innocence of her son - Assange holds herself in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an indefinite place. During the meeting, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior leader for the fight against anti-terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt by the President Barack Obama spokesman to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are announcing in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to say that Assange had to be "killed" had to be revoked.
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or anything."
Anyone who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever has been who has allowed information to be leaked in the government, he is guilty of treason, and all that is not execution is a too lenient punishment," he told Fox.
PuigcercÃ3s seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod Close to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to reach a secret ballot on his continued existence.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan PuigcercÃ3s seems to have found a recipe to avoid an internal riot for the umpteenth time in the ranks of the after the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes directionless ERC.
The party leader is aware that his resignation is not enough for the loved ones of former party leader Josep LluÃ3s Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as their mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could secretly comment on his staying in office.
With ballot papers, not with shift hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the presidence a ticket, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would not feel confirmed by half of the vote plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod affiliates demand more from the president than to provide his office only to the party. An inadequate gesture, since PuigcercÃ s controls the supreme organ of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to promote resignations, they will agree on a action plan with the Board from now until May.
In return, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the Strategic Reorientation Document, that the leadership will present the Council to the vote on 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for PuigcercÃ3s. In return, he is to promise to bring the congress back to autumn 2011, which the party leadership already considers to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is a pity in stability and he strives once and for all to make the organization capable of washing its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the reigning Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcerc is an ideologue, the owner of InnovaciÃo considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various objectives".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the General Assembly principle as its functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
PuigcercÃo's team, which fought for at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 trembling meeting, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the General Assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, since the internal rest of the last few years has not been advisable to approach this matter.
Now, without the critical sector, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.

China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China said at COP16 that its country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its supply of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16, assures.
At his first public appearance on the 16th UN Climate Summit (COP16) assured Su Wei that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He said that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He said, on the other hand, that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and supporting pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives for reducing gases emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities had worked with those of the central government and the communities to achieve the goals of saving energy, effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
He also said, has already undertaken several years of plans or closed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the effective energy program, which has been introduced over the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project on provincial level on climate change, another to exchange traditional light bulbs through energy-saving bulbs and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, government advisor to climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than was commonly assumed.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tons per person, while in the United States it was 100 tons. China is responsible for a total nine percent contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent in the last five years and further is to be done by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former panist party had the right to appeal to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right would be granted to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the right to him had.
In an interview before the appeal was held by Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision that had been taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the ComisiÃ3n de Teuton de Consejo Nacional in his case, so that a decision is taken by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to become a presidential candidate has never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that AcciÃ1⁄4n Nacional was stronger from the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th conference. December, where his successor is elected, emerged.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a shock for the community elections, he was successful and served his purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "Is not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best chairmanship that AcciÃ3n Nacional needed for the next three years. Therefore, he passed the relay "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unceasi and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party leader."
He predicted that of the one in the last elections of the 4th elections. July recorded the party's upswing to be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not time to think of 2012."
"Now it is a matter of supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would bear the flag and observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is up to the requirements."
When he was asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe CalderÃ3n for his discourses in his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and CalderÃ3n, they should begin to defend them if they finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government can make expressions such as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no word for words and even less censorship.
Obama campaigns for the law in favour of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you're in favour of passing the Dream Act - Law, call your senators and push for the passage of this law," the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Law to Legalize Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social web Twitter.
"If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act - Law, call your senators and push for the passing of this law," Obama tweeted.
His short message contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document calling on the public to get in touch with their senators, since the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he says.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the extension of the tax reductions from the time of Bush and the funding of the administration would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Law Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time, and after that we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would ask for the vote on the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Law, which would be voted on the initiative to legalize undocumented students in the Senate next Thursday, even though the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - Law, or the Law of the American Dream, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in this country and are enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the advocates of the project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most courted Republicans include those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they did not support another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Senate Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust to the Language' was a walk in which the participants made a strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "takes us in trouble", the Argentine scripture spewed sweetly towards the audience, which was made up mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table hosted by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio RamÃ3rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz then marked as a great narrative. Luisa tells the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she receives no answer, but gives clues to the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinces: "Patid is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst smells the secret: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs relieved and closed that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and did not exist." But she is convinced that the desire of the language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also presented an adorable story, which he called 'praise of the invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back widely travelled men or restore the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a U-turn and reported on America, the great novel, which did not lack its own chronicler from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of the stories told by the conquerers.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in a different way the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the feeling of shame."
However, he emphasizes that "the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lie approach each other where one no longer knows which side belongs to the narrative, where fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is said."
When it was the turn of Mayra, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIl invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated her contribution to the great wound of the social violence that affects her country - as well as the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained, after she had pointed out that literature is communication and commitment, which is based between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was completed by the Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose contribution also "the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" was elevated.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness on dogmatisms will also amount to dogmatisms, and forget that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: And nuance often means putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass those who prefer to divide the world into black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three losses in finishes, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey during the endgame, two different styles are also faced with each other, given by their respective coaches, and their encounters marked by opposites are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has played himself up for the second champion with the medal, he has one step behind the winners and, astonishingly, he played successive finals with the same team.
The santistic strategist reached the first final as a coach at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost to Rayados with 3-1.
Rubén had to take a setback again with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was a draw after 210 games, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game.
Rubén had already lost two endgames with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I love, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the helmsman, asked about the lost endgames.
The last endgame has remained strong in his memory, he assured to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players are also prepared, because the last time we were already prepared to withdraw with two penalty, and I believe that the one is a teaching, until the game is not closed."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts, does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate were a bad game, sometimes something, sometimes due to nervousness or the sometimes the sometimes the something we were already looking to this something, the title, sometimes this something, we were something, we look forward to this thing."
It is in Romanso's power to no longer be just the second champion and to taste the fame that the titles bring with them for the first time.
The USA changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Before their conference at the consulate, the people must present themselves to the service offices for visa applications; costs will be reduced.
From the 10th The procedures for applying for a visa in the United States embassy and consulates will change on January 1st of 2011.
In the new procedure, most applicants must introduce themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letter in English) before their conference at the consulate.
The staff of the ASC takes up the biometric data of the applicant, which are checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the processing of the visa decrease, because it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over separately.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the representative to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is obtained in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for a visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service premium of 26 dollars.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found in the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201-Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the finding of alien life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The United States National Aerospace Authority (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from astrobiology experts at 1 p.m. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
Upon convening of the press conference, NASA assured it would present "a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments that have been considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was put forward that they could turn into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It seems that it is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic to all imaginable life forms, since the lake is strongly arsenable.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances of giving similar lives to other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
If these organisms metabolise arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is shown that "there is actual another life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know."
The Space Agency announces the actual reach of its find tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn's largest moon) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and PatrÃ3n form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organic Law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th had just had the 60th. Legislation was started, and an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and JesÃos Manuel PatrÃ3n Montalvo, who introduced himself as an independent one, were installed. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the introductory session begins to the 60th anniversary. The legislative period was railed by Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and PatrÃ1⁄4n Montalvo, against the reform of the Organic Law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there were two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidium, led by the panist Salvador LÃ3pez Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political constraints with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They started from their political will, and if they had not, they would be subjugated by both parties again, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up to this point, I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, who do not even take consideration to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez RodrÃ3guez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and PatrÃ3n and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now to be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that there should be an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"This group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they can become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT expressed the PAN and PRI that the congress had currently turned into a 'prey' for two.
"It was only one party before, now they split up these together."
PatrÃ1⁄4n Montalvo requested that the honourable Members be respected and give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out because of top decisions, which will probably be nine MEPs. The five, which are currently seen as split into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The Mazatlán municipality pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of just over 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the amount paid to the company's owner for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso was issued with the number 9258447 on the last 16th. issued in November with the purpose "Setting outstanding invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel LÃopez Moreno had already sent ahead that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoria Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What was not mentioned is the total amount that is still to be owed to it and, as a result, the number of checks issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, the debts are simply paid, just as they are paid to the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappear" in the last quarter of the year "resurrected": 24. September, two from 15th September October, 19 October October, 29 October October and this last one of the 16th November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that their services are not used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper on the 25th of May July the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers was published, it became known that it was previously issued from March 2008 to 9. During the three-year term of office, Jorge Abel LÃopez Sánchez, the municipality had paid the municipality of more than 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where they earned checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Touristic places need to be improved
Tourist enterprises regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the burglary of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán's tourism industry applied to pay special attention to the authorities, the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada trade association, recalled that at different occasions it was called for the destination to be maintained and the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had a negative effect, as the tourists could come to a stroll and see the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise, they would not carry out the construction work slowly and haphazardly in this way."
The hotel owner José RamÃ3n Manguart Sánchez said that the overthrow of the tourist had made aware of the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How should she do that? Well, by providing preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, we inhabitants also have the right to a clean habitat. The city administration needs to change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly keeping in good shape," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
RaÃol Llera Martinez, under-secretary of PromociÃ3n TurÃ3stica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they are not used properly and gave rise to a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to shape along with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be paramount.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first of all need to be tidy and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we are advertising this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MPs should take the great responsibility of laying down a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
The corporate industry of Mazatlán is calling for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th century was Parliament inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. This is what makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups who are dependent on good parliamentary work, and that the same patterns of partiality and paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurs' Coordination Council, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility of laying a role model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right to act freely from collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they transform into carnival compass of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to build the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, stand up for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José RamÃ3n Mangu Art Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the great challenges faced by the 40 representatives of the people is the driving force and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they are driving economic growth, creating incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will help job creation in some way."
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MEPs to allocate the necessary importance to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget to promote it.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the second most resources. This is incompatible with important economic activity, which brings foreign currency and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agribusiness."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not redefined in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Saint King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next Tripod, because the household is no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, JesÃos, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isapsi, José Juan and Miguel do not give hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they want.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from their hand to the mouth, because the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes hard times are the order of times because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go on the road with the brats to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes for a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother JesÃos, Cayetana suggests clothes in size for one-year-old.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster,' but I replied, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very dear," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old Maria Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old IsaÃas is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
14-year-old José Juan are missing tennis shoes. A pair of 5 1/2 or 6 sizes would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the Noroeste newspaper's lobby.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, cannabis production and sales networks were crushed by ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will be faced with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they are said to have served mainly drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered the main wire bodysufferers of the drug ring, were arrested from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke judicial building hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, accusation of production of cannabis, their possession for sales purposes, the frame and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation activity, which went on for more than a year.
"The information received from the public sector has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel.
Around 70 policemen from the Estrien regional investigation unit of the Quebec Security Police Department, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily persecuted
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, is to settle the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be stamped in after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I lean strongly against this charter."
"I keep with a party that has put shackles on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting, before the assembled deputies.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows each of the seagoages identified to be transported to be recorded for up to a year of seagoing for up to a year, as proposed, violated the Canadian law and freedom constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill, as he turns against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed to it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism regarding Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has rejected critics from the hand who demanded that her party was not steadfast enough to the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are trying to enforce this by arranging another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We are therefore not in favour of the Conservative bill because it is looking for the blame for the refugees and keeping children imprisoned for at least one year," said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians urge the MPs to not tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal events that concern Canada and that treat the country like a foothold."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have refused.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP immediately declares to his constituents.
The new unity does not find an unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry into this issue.
Robert Dutil, a public security minister, claims that this idea is not coming from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation last January on this issue.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October. October last year was not discussed in the least, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois qualified, this announcement in terms of public security as a "rabbit conjured up from the hat" and "solution that is rightly crafted at a table end".
For his part, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power had too much influence over the future unity in question.
"They will see the result if we announce it," he contented himself to confirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means of being able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (state of state. College to train high administrative officials).
To get out of this impasse, he proposes to grant Quebec a special mandate to the financial audit control so that they can investigate corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the examination control," he decided.
It also believes that Quebec could grant the audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the bankruptcies of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law to be better tailored to these types of crimes.
This demand comes from the Chief Public Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague of justice, Rob Nicholson, are currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people were arrested, even though the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism as a result.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict guarding due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street has fallen together.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation has poured into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 further millimetres of rainfall were expected here until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimetres of rain showers had come down here.
Since the snowmelt that has already accumulated in certain areas is to be added to these rainfall, the transfer of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service declared warnings about the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jéréme, in the Laurentian mountains and the chone in LotbiniÃ3re, become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
The heavy rainfall has caused the transgression of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an alternative bridge was carried away due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the transgression of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Flood Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, especially mascainongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reprimanded
The Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians, as well as his abusive way of speaking on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinions, but certain statements would have included "unsufficient information about social care and unjustly negative presentations of Haitians, as well as such an uncouth way of speech, which is not appropriate for the broadcasts during the daytime."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion about suicide involving the distribution of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in the period 2008 and 2010.
The first disposition was lodged as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des Personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid as misleading information.
Regarding the issue of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" had raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not blamed against his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had had come up with a media-related dispute in this regard, which had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that they had not donated them in favour of Haiti aid, because they did not know with certainty whether those in need would really receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustifiably negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I have already lost my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an uncouth way of expressing.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM banker acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, had had to communicate its decisions once during the main end time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Algerian origins of Montreal, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now rising to the tatami and the boxing rings of the world in the search for new challenges.
"I started martial arts such as kunging and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 in order to develop further among professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fighting, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are scarce."
Recently, his sign as a security guard had gave his rivals bad news, who worked as a security guard and at the UPS company, in which he had done bad news at the between the 23rd and 30th. October in Edinburgh, Scotland, amateur world championship two gold medals held by the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) won.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category were invited to be among the top four at the last World Championship."
"I babe in 2009 in Toronto brought bronze."
"In 2005 I turned eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress on every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China, in which punches and kicks as well as ground throws are permissible.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less frequently in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter who has emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pound guy.
"It's a bit of the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will each coincide in the final of their category."
"Then the winners face each category to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved mutual agreements to project planning companies of 450 million dollars in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Ã...nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a side effect of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to hand over this important hydroelectric project in the amount of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Ã...nergie gérance" came up with the lucrative treaty without there having been a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that increases the risk of competition formation and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing game and exhausts the competition."
"This means that instead of games framed instead of secret means, you are now performing in open form," said Sylvain Simard, a member of prisoner of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Secretary Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract had been a frame-up game.
"I remain true to my line," she railed by reinforcing that the PQ had "daughted" and "lacks it hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise with regard to a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the treaty was awarded without competition being allowed to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception, even in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flyover of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be more consistent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, attributes to the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the "Ecury gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken a special account of this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has had the nose over the fact that the contract has been approved by the project management after the agreement.
"If you make a call and there are only a few applicants, your prices will skyrocket."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
This contract, approved by the consortium "Ecurge gérance", is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts granted to companies or branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking their share in "Ã...nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They amount to 449 783 344, including the contract with "Ã...nergie gérance" over 295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had hinted upon the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "financed" before she specified that they were their managers.
Barometer of verification-conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but uncertain.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also not to the marked brands or eco-labels that are supposed to steer his choice.
It's a pity, even though it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where information is teeming with more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, a shortcoming that identifies itself as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading shown, which was held yesterday.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admits that it does not believe the environmental commitment of the companies as well as the green corporate advertising, so the responsible consumer center of Sherbrooke reveals the sophisticated measuring instrument of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt their trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Nevertheless, information about responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently stimulated by just over a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are being tried and tested.
According to another statement, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and had mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they also had preferred 61% purchases from traders in their district and had encouraged the purchase of foods grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Quebec homo consumus loves to present itself as a king of recycling, who is trying to reduce its environmental traces by looking after animal welfare.
However, social and ecological awareness still seems to stop at his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they used public transport or to preferred the ride-in centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The feeding and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behaviour survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was invited by Société Angus and the company Paralléle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to work together, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Paralléle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex belonging to Daniel Langlois' cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return to its actual cinematic function, apparently not receive what they have demanded.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a loan in a lower than the initially hoped-for amount, which could create a viable solution to favorable conditions, at least according to the sources removable from the state litter box.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, the application has been corrected downwards since the repeated bunch.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), Francois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final fact-side report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was submitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Paralléle and Angus have now reached their views until 31. December Time to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not provide financial aid for real estate projects there, which he did not also have to provide other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, subjected substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years with great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinema halls that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele on the track.
The Société Angus and the company Paralléle with Christian Yaccarini are leading their part, heading to a privately financed campagne, from which they hope to stimulate the acquisition of a sum of 700,000 dollars.
Since spring 2009, only a single screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le ParallÃ le.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and you ignored what he and his group hold of the downward corrected proposals that they have been made.
Mystery of the complex shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic leaderships spread by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations regards to the Americans under the Canadian's inferiority complex; but they reveal the same sense of superiority to Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that Canadian voters did not have Canadian-American relations in the sense of the story, and they believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government enforce their 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were distributed to the public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content to nibbling.
One from the 22. In September 2008, a dating connection, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the attention of the United Nations no longer participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador appointed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various possibilities for this situation.
"An inherent inferiority complex to the Canadians may because Canadians may because Canadian political leaders may be more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to shift the black Peter to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade) ", he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial type of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship, which the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the vote in the sense of the vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the 22nd Bill sent by Terry Breese, charg d'affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the confidence vote against the federal budget in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade caused by a recovery program amounting to 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the so-related continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another January 2008 dating and by Ambassador Wilkins notified Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC spread dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are less subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or even seductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by CIA muscle procrops.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case-by-case decision'.
The end of the meeting, as described, "he has handed the State Secretary a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary of state has promised to review the file again".
Finally, let us note that the minds heat up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very narrow consultant, had explained via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had given talks here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan to renew the lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to reducing the greenhouse gas (CFC) reduction, which is almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments of industrialised countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFCs released to Earth due to the lighting would be avoided if the white-hotening bulbs, which were still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better even more than light diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the large exhaust emission centers such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans, which were supposed to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would have to be withdrawn from this record in order to stabilise the climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced even twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched on the market this week - this society, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, which conveys an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that yes completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a collection point.
According to the report, however, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit coal-fired mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-annealed pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the gains that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would, for example, save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects excited notice of election results
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "destant" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need of the independent electoral commission to preserve its work and to announce the preliminary results without further postponement," said a UN leader's press spokesman.
"It asks all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the preliminary results are promulgated."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline set at midnight to wednesday, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many appeals from all over the world were voiced that the CEI will finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of election under Laurent Gbagbo, who is leaving office, and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is expecting the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup, which failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the FN's manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo confactors are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has assessed the delay in the promulgation of the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His alliance division affirms that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, since he knew that he had lost; and to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the electoral commission was prevented from publishing the results was prevented from publishing the results.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held to crown the unification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned the leaders of the Ivory Coast on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for it in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round on 31st October with 38% of the votes compared to the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a leading candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis, in line with the International Labour Office (IAA) (including the overseas departments at 9.%), the provisional, seasonally adjusted figures published by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee on Thursday show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7%, including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
From an incoming period were not employed in the French metropolis in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
The senior citizens, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the people over 50, 6.6%, including overseas departments.
Only 25-49 year olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France in the overall way.
After a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to continue in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhone region (PS), an investigation was initiated and he was taken to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of an investigation into the public and suspicious markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzling shareholders, misappropriating general indictment, receiving hire, complicity in corruption, unauthorised bribery and possession of weapons, said his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to debate any questions that the prosecution will ask him instead of spreading fantasies."
"It is easy to subject to a number of criminal indictments, another matter is to prove it," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-NoÃol Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had placed great emphasis on sending the judge a memory to justify his attorneys before his hearing.
A member Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keeping his landfill he had to run.
With regard to the business competence area or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have had knowledge, said Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Public Service, was also charged with embezzlement and complicity on Wednesday, but then released under the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and were released from detention from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under judicial supervision, said Michel Raffin, Deputy Attorney General.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole waste management company (MPM), is being prosecuted due to "undue influence and passive corruption".
Two state officials from Aubagne's conurbation, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title of "intercuring and misappropriating of general goods by a public service agent," the other for "complice with misappropriation in misappropriating public funds."
The partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "the recealing and embetion of social assets".
Among the people who were faced with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public-sector activities that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company, to have helped wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 in the files of several open investigations as a result of anonymous letters.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the award and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain towns in the Marseille Municipal Watershed (MPM) territory.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace overgives its mediating role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "espionage", kept the French public's sues, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this among the attentive views of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents preserved by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "gesture" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not release Majid Kakavand, a Iranian who was imprisoned in France and wanted by the American judiciary to performance due to the trade in material in favour of Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they are using the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this respect.
One on the 12th Billograph edited in Paris on August 1, 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way in which hostage-taking is dealing".
Francois Richier, Elysée Advisor on Strategy, talked with Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything they can to return their own nationals, who were forcibly held in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "characterized loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "friendly human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "Silentness is solving nothing", passing the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "conclusive Iranian tactic": "Courtation for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which on 16 February. August was to be achieved on the day she takes refuge in the French embassy "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he makes it sayy that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that will "getting worse".
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran in the near future," he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but will continue to be held in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demanded to Iran for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, was released from custody after a judge in Paris has been made.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is following the illegal Iranian network of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a horse commerce ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French ?
On the occasion of another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4th edition of Kathleen In September, Francois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently MichÃ3le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a telephone number, puts it back on, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian, "currently being in the buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make believers by means of pronouncements and "flight attempts organized by the media," Syrian President Bachar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediating role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of the 25th August 2009 dating telegram conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is based on so much "thanks to Mr. Assad" is about, the Paris message is asking himself.
"Despite their explanations full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was perceived as prematurely and undeserted by numerous critics' votes in France and abroad."
"The Syrian role building" tries to show Paris "Syria which commendation can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "swallow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On the 11th August had confided to Francois Richier: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16th Return to France in May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a commune, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our land makers".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Craps", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, so government leaders indicated.
A bill to ask online game operators to deny young people under the age of 16 after midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, representatives of religious ministries and ministries of the family.
"Many kids play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also leading a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Ministerial Representative of the French press agency, Commissioner entrusted with this draft law by the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be open again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also considering asking the manufacturers to scale down the time limit granted daily to these games to those youngsters whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish, which will make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in online game competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games over 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA Appoints the Host Land
In bright excitement caused by suspicion of corruption, FIFA' Executive Committee on Thursday will include the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the waying of influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes therefore threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
Following FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer more arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the execution committee at the moment of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with bringing about the suspension of two members of the execution of the execution of two members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well have ruined the chances of their own country, cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup, in 1966.
The BBC had once again breeded the ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that shots up three influential members of the Committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to anger FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had been lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the mov that his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue England's image before the contract?
Nothing is less certain, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack a trump card with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial dark sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about Solvency of Spain and Portugal are increasing the chances of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the frank hint at the charges of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the Committee.
"They are throwing up with dirt, trying to compromise them," Putin railed.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorite.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 World Cup approval for China, which is making the Asian chances of laps in 2022, which are making it obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the stops with the waiting for futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA, which is the suffering of the European countries.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really clipped.
The middle margin had made him take a swear.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not look good at the side of the mystery that attaches to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt would henceforth.
In one sense, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, supporters said Jacques Chiracs that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it himself.
On the 15th In a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy assured November that his decision be made "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would suggest the perspective of "two seats" in the Elysée on Tuesday evening in front of the UMP parliamentarians had spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy ?
Far from being missed.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they cause comments, then for a twofold reason.
Accelerating the race for the election rate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of the competition with SégolÃ3ne Royal, which is driving Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS exhorted earlier than accepted to combat.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer Francois Fillon's candidacy for Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded directly and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were to be defeated as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned himself to the obviousness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order for a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt can undoubtedly not afford to forfeit the current situation on the European bond markets, in order not to provoke their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in favour of resolving Europe's budget debt.
She did not dare to say whether she believes that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its programme of government bond purchases.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB the day before in Brussels, had not shown himself very eloquently on his plans at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but rather contented to point out that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would be "continued" and that we will "see how decisions will be at the meeting on Thursday."
The only certainty: The ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bondage purchases of the treasury from the ECB last week were doubled to around 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the secretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases to Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the retailers, the anticipation of a further pursuit of the purchase price is not doubted (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable change in the course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months will have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to create the unrestricted reserves of money in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already making themselves known that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in an essential way."
"It would also take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal, anticipates his part.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that stimulates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must be at any price to the lack of investors in the market and act in this way to prevent the hasty enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states," yesterday testified to an important bondholder.
If interest rates start to fly at the height, the states would be prevented even more from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is covered in Italy
After a disturbing start to the week for Italy, the situation yesterday has eased a little with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional chairmen Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indicatable" and heard him reckon with an "unpredictable" weekend, but the person immediately denied what the person concerned immediately disfigured.
In any case, on Tuesday, the scissors with German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy at German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed his right hand as "hardly concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible danger of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dish-reducing tax intakes, which are at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget budget available at the Senate expects to be considered 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the riot about a new household collective, which could be used to a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the time Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, we have been repeating this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term, nor in the long term, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. R.) less stabilization progress is required than from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political integrity remains.
On the 14th Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies in December, as a result of which the early elections could be organised at the end of March.
A little favourable period is therefore ahead of decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had expressly emphasised it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe that it was proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: the Europeans clearly hold together, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area".
Although perfectly relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest feet of European government bonds was grist to the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, there can be no question of a normalisation start.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly on banking systems," says the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially, especially since "the political time passes much more slowly than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger hidden in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures that are already in place.
The informal discussions between the most direct finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their other parties to the G20, are making good progress.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The scene includes the fate of the unconventional measures to reinforce the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling began its Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not an explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first securities expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had entrusted Reuters to the agency, the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-round countries, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market organisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures, but are intended to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
To avoid at any price, both one and the other, are to ask for international assistance before they have decided their own budget-reconcised and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who joins the company on 24. In November, it was the first to come across the idea that if the 750 euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to reach its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, regarding the market of European public debt, judge against the market of European public debt, judge that an extension of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This appropriation exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.

Snow and black ice: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snow episodes still entail traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert due to the impending risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sevres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments, which are already in alert Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snowed slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm are expected, in places also from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
Affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cotes d'Armor, Finistere, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Cotes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the transport axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in emergencies, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school services were suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for on Wednesday evening for heavy traffic.
The prefecture "calls for drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of Orly's expected heavy snow on Thursday.
The DGAB recommends that you contact your airline passenger.
Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
The 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro is to be remembered in particular, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital bid of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then enable the SGP to give a portion of the cash sum to their doubles in the markets.
Today, the first projections were finally made.
The 2010 supplementary budget of 2010, reviewed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this fund.
These are double measures: the creation of a special tax on the development and increase taxation of offices at Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is estimated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a rearrangement of the existing corporate taxation: "in order to modernise them in order to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not estimated in the text.
Of the 4 billion, it is a long way off.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion in the capital endowment brought down by the state and that the Société du Grand Paris is gradually being paid for the project," says the explanatory statement.
With the SGP you cannot find this system at all offensive.
"Since the moment you have booked revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the project planning for more than three years and then draw only from the 4 billion," explains.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP is estimating that 2013 will be started to mark the 4 billion on the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions will be able to look for a long time, runs the risk of causing a rather moving parliamentary discussion.
The first public session will take place on the 7th of October December.
Raccious hackers and busy spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a twofold meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense hypocrisy that governs the relationships between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let us proceed in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by an intelligence service (an local nation) is made exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary", American revelations over Berlusconi's sexual habits throw off nothing more than what has been read over months in any journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists for a long time fabric for their sketches.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esthermal publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosbrunette) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish any research on occult texts (yet because he does not know where news about the non-existing thing can be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultation do not believe in anything but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the successful mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be something, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, were the same as those Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a frieze made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-be-adigen hacker can tap into the secret secrets of the world's most powerful country holds the considerable blow against the prestige of the state deceased.
Moreover, the scandal brings the victims less than the "sharp judges" into distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct where every movement can be controlled thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become a total sacrifice of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the passage of control ceases to be one-sided and becomes circle-shaped.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can find out the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, since it reveals the public sphere; but reveal in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets.
WikiLeaks has neither been wrong Sarkozy nor Merkel, but Clinton and Obama did not do wrong.
What will be the consequences of this offense inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that the states will not provide any reserved information online in the future - this would amount to a notice glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports secret via telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state is moving on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and certain relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable routes, not carrying their messages anywhere else than in memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in the only copy in sealed drawers: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is moving forward like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with a (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band by reeling from back to front and unraveling all the secrets of the montage, while the (numerical) CDs today allow nothing else than jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the change.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France talks its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the quickly resolved financial promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing) that have been implemented by the developing countries.
And already the rough French experts are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to making 30 billion dollars available between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France has promised EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has pulled all the registers to its partners from the fact of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report by its Member States, press conferences, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and equally appreciated for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see it when all developed countries made the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, bringing it on the right path to respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional deployment has been brought in without being to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a guideline for those of 2009: the international financing will be maintained and is adding 150 million over three years as part of the "Fast Start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar indicative values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at official development assistance level.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there is no benchmark for expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to respect its commitment to the 'new and additional' financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about it, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are located 1 borrowed € as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to accurate: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission containment, which are based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro, which is collected as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the country of investors should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in its interesting than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by raising 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and donating 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are making 100% of their obligations with donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union spend €1 in order to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and means a comparable commitment.
Beautiful hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 millions of "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the total number of discussions on the climate.
But the drop could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its way of recording for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of disputes of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently discussed topic): the question of "reculability" or the type of booking of its loans does not escape.
France could change its position to be as progressive with regard to disputes as it is with other things.
Hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "recyclability" and the use of loans would inherently increase the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years occupies 81 different chemical substances throughout the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that their results "given the small number of analyzed samples do not reflect a statistically significant value, but rather an illustration character of the treated problem," had bought between July and September the food usually consumed within four foods consumed by about ten years with meals plus a snack in supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as sweets from laboratories in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safely barren, as well as 37 substances with an endocrinine disturbance factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the approximately settling, this survey is very well taken from the fact that the reality in which consumers are exposed to possibly carcinogenic substances or substances with an endocrin disturbance factor is caused by the consumer," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study has found traces of an insecticide that was strictly banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the hoe steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were also peppered.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At dinner, the salmon steak was "rich in the most" with 34 chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unencumbered.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "will probably be undervalued," says the study.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
