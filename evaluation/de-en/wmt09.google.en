The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the red at close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed Monday&#39;s slump right at the start of Tuesday&#39;s trading, dropping another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the slump was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the local financial sector, can be seen.
Fall in stocks in Asia
Shares on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index slipped nearly four percentage points during the business day but later erased some of the losses, narrowing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange fell more than 5 percent but then narrowed losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the local index.
&quot;The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,&quot; said Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam.
Despite being part of China, Hong Kong determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the draft financial system support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries would also be affected by the slump.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would cost up to $700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion).
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush&#39;s request to support the plan.
In Bush&#39;s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes posting their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar slump it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but no sooner was there any sign that the bill would not pass the House of Representatives than the index went into free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
Leaders of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It should be voted on early next week.
US lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks to pass a $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) bailout plan for the US financial system.
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the US Congress on Monday.
Banking and Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank told Reuters on Sunday.
According to various sources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, an announcement that the plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for a recovery in financial markets.
After that, however, there was a &quot;disillusionment&quot; due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan has to be effective
&quot;We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a market stabilization package should look like,&quot; Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with the American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This envisages a purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from the finance companies, which plunges the finance companies into heavy losses and endangers the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We are on the verge of definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the marketplace.
You have to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we&#39;re there,&quot; Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is intended to reassure investors about transactions in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a decision by Congress could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and it is also unclear whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will pass in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it feels the program isn&#39;t doing its job, with an additional $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush sees progress in negotiations as positive
While the President has veto power over this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the core tenet of the program has remained, which was based on raising finance to buy bad mortgage securities that have fallen in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgages.
&quot;We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,&quot; said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday&#39;s progress and &quot;appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Restriction on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on accountability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding benefits and a timeline for funding the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the scheme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The Treasury should be in charge of this.
&quot;We&#39;ve worked very hard on this and made great strides towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,&quot; Paulson said.
The plan also envisages helping homeowners who are struggling to pay off their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing borrowers&#39; monthly costs and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
&quot;That&#39;s because you don&#39;t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share the losses between themselves,&quot; Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is irrelevant in Marek&#39;s view.
&quot;It&#39;s much more important that congressmen agree to support the plan and that they pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological meaning of the agreement that there will be a farewell is the most important thing at this moment,&quot; stressed Marek.
Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they come to a total of 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria brought about a noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People&#39;s Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the previous chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously in jeopardy.
In contrast, the electoral officer of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is gearing up for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but has lost 5.5 percent of the votes since the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP did even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results for these two major parties in Austria&#39;s post-war history, and especially for the People&#39;s Party, which had called for the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People&#39;s Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party executive on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could repeat itself, when the People&#39;s Party made agreements with the populists (at that time it was the FPÖ still unified, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a joint government, which even resulted in sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider is obviously counting on this development, who has already stated that he is prepared to work with any party and assumes that he will return to Vienna to take part in Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably cleared the four percent hurdle and consequently not entered parliament.
A knife-edge duel: MP3 players versus cell phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
So, of course, it looks like it&#39;s better to just buy a phone.
Despite everything, there are enough reasons why you should get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
Surely one hardly buys a great expensive record player for the home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc&#39;s latest album.
For one thing, such musical novelties don&#39;t appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there&#39;s no objective reason for it either.
However, if you have art rock, jazz or blues LPs on your shelf, you are probably dreaming of at least one.
It&#39;s the same with music on trips, i.e. with compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will also find it difficult to cope with headphones for twenty crowns on the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
Battery life is also important.
Some good music players can do a lot more than just play music, but they can&#39;t even begin to do what cell phones can do.
No modern device can be used as universally as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, making phone calls and texting, it can play music and videos, record both, sometimes it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and it can perhaps also navigate.
And if you factor in the smartphones and communicators, you&#39;ve almost got a small computer in your pocket.
It&#39;s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more functions you use on your cell phone, the more frequently you will have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Few phones can play music for more than 10-12 hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That&#39;s why you should expect the cheap cell phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you still make phone calls from time to time, it&#39;s better to buy a charger for the office to be on the safe side - this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won&#39;t have this problem with MP3 players, even the lesser ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous use on a single charge.
Another problem arises when you want to transfer the music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small number of devices have a USB connection, and not every cell phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With players, you do not need any special software, with a few exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via the USB port.
Most phones and players create their own music library, organized by artist name, album title, genre, or user rating, for example.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address book, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with OS).
Players are easier to use, cell phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, ease of use.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you only listen to it briefly every day, for example on the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files will suffice.
What almost every mobile phone can do.
You don&#39;t have to particularly control which music formats a mobile phone or player can handle.
Everyone creates MP3, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better cell phones also make it possible to buy music online.
All you have to do is call up the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet and you can already buy a song or album.
This service in and of itself can be a compelling argument as to why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the provider&#39;s offer is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices aren&#39;t the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this way of selling music (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them.
When you feel like listening, reach for the phone in your pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free kit with you.
If not, you can fall back on the built-in speaker, which almost every mobile phone has, but only very few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music cell phones will be the price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
You can get a decent Walkman for three or four thousand kronor.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is that it is easy to use.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - players can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneously switched on mobile internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card later, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But be careful.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don&#39;t have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, it is better to use specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is close to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest along is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman line of phones share the same user interface as MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (typically 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturers .
The first virtual provider will come to the Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic ones to lower prices.
Perhaps this will not be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile phone providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How come the prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a declaration of war.
It may sound paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is so much competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees with this.
It&#39;s probably true that a classic provider with its own network doesn&#39;t have many chances anymore (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequencies either).
But there is one more option - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile phone providers then had to react.
Even before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market in Great Britain, there were voices similar to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don&#39;t have to look far for examples.
In February this year we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers, becoming the country&#39;s fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
You don&#39;t need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually position themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less comprehensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, going for a non-clichéd audience can also be a pretty good move.
This provider is aimed specifically at men.
&quot;Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust,&quot; said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the company that operates this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
The spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It&#39;s also relatively saturated from a service offering perspective.&quot;
No chance in the Czech Republic, say the mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly promising.
Mobilking is more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region,&quot; said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of corporate customers, has been showing interest in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
&quot;We have a keen interest in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already been able to make progress in negotiations with some of them,&quot; said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
According to unofficial information, the first virtual provider can be expected perhaps by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
&quot;At this moment we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area,&quot; says Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónica O2 press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point out the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in rare agreement with O2&#39;s statement, adds: &quot;So far we haven&#39;t found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.&quot;
And she adds: &quot;Hardly any virtual provider will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think on such short notice.&quot;
Vodafone is more focused on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický says: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider the best from the customer&#39;s point of view.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile Internet.&quot;
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The actions of the cell phone providers are easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, which would lead to falling prices and thus also to a drop in profits.
So why should you make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when something is at stake is also proven by the long back and forth about the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came onto the market.
This is also proven by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is a suitable argument as to why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová commented: &quot;The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Considering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and especially its services.&quot;
In view of this approach by the mobile phone providers, the absolute lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately - in contrast to Great Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
This is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
&quot;The market entry of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers,&quot; said Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in response to our inquiry.
Such a formulation would not come as a surprise from representatives of the providers.
From an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, is supposed to ensure that nobody abuses their position on the market, this is more than questionable.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual operators operate quite normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction of mobile telephone services.&quot;
However, pressure on the correct functioning of the market and price reduction are probably not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile phone providers that results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the gas stations is surely just a coincidence and the result of tough competition.
&quot;The Authority has not found any indication of any anti-competitive behavior in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking in the telecommunications regulator,&quot; Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many contentious issues.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different point of view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider has - logically - the monopoly for his network.
This means that he necessarily has a dominant position in a certain segment.
Even if you don&#39;t go along with this line of argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile phone providers are proceeding in a remarkably similar way.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all providers.
Shifting the responsibility onto the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to extend the competences of the ČTÚ to the area of economic competition in telecommunications in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, although a number of experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only some of them are public.
Normally, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach a select few.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, they will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar types of resale.
&quot;If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a matter of breach of contractual terms, which we will then deal with, which may lead to termination of cooperation with the relevant company,&quot; Martina Kemrová replied to our question to this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that word of this will not get around to those responsible at the mobile phone provider.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
From the activities of these companies, they generate not inconsiderable profits, at the same time - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: &quot;The law allows for such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it like the normal customers of the mobile network providers.&quot;
But that alone should at least seem strange to the ČTÚ.
Another question also arises for the ÚOHS.
If cell phone providers turn a blind eye to such an approach, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it doesn&#39;t want to, it doesn&#39;t have to be satisfied with providers&#39; declarations that they don&#39;t know about it and that their terms and conditions forbid it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a significant drop in prices for the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, who were not trying to protect the interests of the mobile phone providers, but rather those of their customers.
Whether through formal action or non-formal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case at each other like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that lack of clarity in the competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But let&#39;s not throw in the towel.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile communications market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile network provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally no longer be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Pick the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland at a ceremony on Sunday to mark the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra conducted by Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo vocals, in a choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The arrangers of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions at once on the iHNed.cz server.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices who were distinctive and popular for the solo versions.
&quot;Right from the start I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then also with the choir, so that the text can be understood well, so that there is harmony,&quot; says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first heard in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theater in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the &quot;new&quot; anthem sound?
On Wednesday, the Prague public transport company will also be using a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of Prague transport as the date when the first passengers to board a metro, tram or bus carried an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
Around one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card can currently buy this.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from January 1, 2009) and have it loaded onto their chip card at the same time in the information centers and branches of the public transport companies on the subway - Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
Since yesterday, the coupons have also been available online on the transport company&#39;s website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers well into the afternoon.
Those who use internet sales can really forget about the issue window in the subway stations, where previously they regularly had to wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, which is loaded onto the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
&quot;At these points, there is also a counter with trained staff available to travelers who advise those interested in buying online and also put the coupon on the card,&quot; says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also load the electronic coupons onto the Opencard at self-service machines that are installed in some underground vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket validators, and passengers may have noticed them in Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; adds Opatrný.
An automatic machine checks the coupon instead of the driver
Operating the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card and the previously purchased coupon will appear automatically.
Starting tomorrow, the electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
That is, on suburban trains and on bus lines Nos. 300 to 499, which are used mainly by residents of the Central Bohemian Region to get to the capital.
&quot;In the trains that belong to Prague&#39;s integrated transport, the conductors have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone,&quot; explains Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization responsible for ticket inspection. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague public transport company.
The suburban buses have card readers at the cash register next to the driver.
When boarding, the chip card not only has to be shown to the driver, but the Opencard has to be placed in a marked place on the side of the cash register.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the coupons that have been loaded.
&quot;If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons that have been played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,&quot; says Drápal.
A passenger who does not ride suburban buses and does not know when the coupon expires can, in turn, go to the self-service machines where the coupons are loaded onto the card.
Here the information on the validity of his documents is shown on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a referendum from the USA
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested that the Bohemian Forest be annexed to the United States.
This comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can&#39;t be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have approached the US President with such a wish.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans from Krumau asked the American President not to allow the return of the &quot;Sudetengau&quot; - which was occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,&quot; says a letter, which began with the words &quot;People to whom fate dear to the heart of the Sudetes&quot;.
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans to assume - knowing the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protectorate of the to take over the Bohemian Forest.
&quot;We cannot believe that, regardless of the views of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you are giving this area to a foreign state that oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and did absolutely nothing to the Allied victory,&quot; the letter reads .
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of revenge from the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
If the US President has any doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest Gau about whether the residents wanted to become part of the USA or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today&#39;s knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that their deportation from the republic would be negotiated, only a few of them even acknowledged such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some form of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
During the war he served as a Budweiser German in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and taken to a POW camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They thought that when they came home, Czech would suit them,&quot; says Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that they would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don&#39;t think so - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety campaign in Czech history.
This is another way of characterizing the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček&#39;s authority promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign, worth 150 million crowns, will run on TV, radio, in cinemas, on the Internet and also on flyers.
It is intended to discourage drivers from driving too fast and driving under the influence of alcohol.
And remind them to buckle up before driving.
Above all, the campaign wants to appeal to the consciences of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people that appeal to emotions.
The &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the whole campaign also bears witness to this:
If you don&#39;t think so - then pay!
The words &quot;don&#39;t think&quot; are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And then in a pool of blood is the word &quot;pay&quot;.
This is supposed to mean that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your life.
The spots will &quot;shock&quot; viewers through 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see pictures with graphic images of accident victims.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were put together by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick for motorists
&quot;The motto for the drivers is carrot and stick.
Carrot means that if they drive on red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk,&quot; said Martin Kořán, traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that&#39;s why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, signs that draw the driver&#39;s attention to a danger are less effective.
&quot;If you put up a static sign warning of a hazard, it will probably soon blend into the environment and drivers will no longer notice it,&quot; says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The head of Israel&#39;s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has advocated the return of virtually all territory occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview printed by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
&quot;We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,&quot; Olmert told the newspaper.
&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because without this there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He acknowledged that an eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
&quot;Anyone who wants safety in Jerusalem and most importantly doesn&#39;t want tractors or bulldozers to roll over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in in the city in July, killing several people and injuring dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a &quot;special solution for the Bern Temple and sacred and historical places&quot; located on the territory of the Old City.
&quot;Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It&#39;s not going to work,&quot; he added.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated Israel&#39;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for signing a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the part of Damascus.
&quot;My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,&quot; Olmert affirmed.
&quot;The Syrians know all too well what they have to give up in order to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shia) Hezbollah movement; they will have to relinquish the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shia) Hamas movement, the al-Khaeda terrorist network and jihad (holy war) in Iraq,&quot; the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
According to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles in India is not resolved, Czech-Indian relations could cool down somewhat.
The minister emphasized this in New York after today&#39;s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
&quot;If this doesn&#39;t clear up, then of course there will be a certain cooling off,&quot; he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
Despite everything, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted to work with the local government in Dardjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
&quot;His problem could be resolved,&quot; said the minister.
According to Mukherdshi, the best thing for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher authority.
He could ask for bail and await his verdict at liberty, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made the same statements during negotiations.
&quot;He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be an option for him,&quot; said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole affair is to provide the convicts with &quot;competent legal assistance,&quot; the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such help is already being offered to them by the Indian side.
&quot;We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-standing tradition.
The Indians admit that too,&quot; Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he reiterated to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
&quot;We really think it&#39;s a big mistake to arrest and charge these Czech scientists,&quot; he said.
The minister dodged an answer to the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
&quot;I&#39;ve already been promised quite a lot,&quot; he simply stated.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, walking around in a long-distance coach is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident involving a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question has been raised as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus while it is being driven.
&quot;If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, then the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic,&quot; said spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week was likely caused by the driver of the truck crossing the path of the bus.
To make matters worse, the young woman was sitting next to the driver at that moment, in the least secure seat in the car, although she still had two other seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing room according to the vehicle registration document.
If this is not provided for on the bus, the travelers must be seated.
Student Agency long-distance coaches are not standing room; which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;We discussed this with the Ministry and this did not agree to the movement of travelers at first.
This was later withdrawn and we came to a consensus that passengers should be allowed to go to the toilet during the journey if they have their seat,&quot; he shared his point of view.
The law knows no steward
&quot;There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes that role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only recognizes the term vehicle attendant; However, it does not define their rights and obligations,&quot; adds the spokesman for the ministry Hanzelka clearly.
On the other hand, the Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this issue retrospectively.
&quot;It depends on whether the bus also has standing room in the product approval.
That&#39;s all,&quot; he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there is standing room and the maximum speed is restricted, local standing room buses with a higher speed limit, and long-distance non-standing room buses with the maximum speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
BESIP road safety specialist Jaroslav Hořín does not see any fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
&quot;If you drive smoothly, there are not many dangers; the situation is comparable to service on board an airplane.
Again, it&#39;s not certain when turbulence will come and the stewardess may hit her head.&quot;
&quot;However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must clarify the safety of the stewards through internal regulations,&quot; he says, adding that the law does not fully resolve this issue.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer steward services.
The company employs around two hundred people in this capacity.
Even after the accident, the director does not see her job as risky.
&quot;But as soon as I get the impression that the steward&#39;s job is risky, I&#39;ll drop it.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to travelers upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs,&quot; he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards on his buses as an interest in safety. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
&quot;We don&#39;t have any stewardesses, but we&#39;ve been against that from the start.
Sooner or later this will end in some fatal accident,&quot; he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
That was an unbelievable tragedy
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed in an accident on a bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off the hard shoulder without indicating and blocked the bus&#39;s route.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid it by making a sharp maneuver, but collided with the truck with his right front part.
Jančura denies that the two seats for the stewards were sold.
&quot;These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked.&quot;
Company plans to sue truck driver
With compensation for the young woman&#39;s family, the agency will not wait for the court verdict, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A law change?
Not in sight
More precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-strong team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
&quot;However, no concrete conclusion has yet been reached.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda either, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving,&quot; says the expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers,&quot; said Hanzelka, although monitoring the safety of the buses is the responsibility of the police and health and safety authorities.
A Czech judges the struggle for the bottom of the sea
He approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
&quot;The island is part of Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself,&quot; says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-strong team at the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds to it from time to time.
There is a spirit of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed holds a little-known world that is rich in natural springs.
Crude oil can be found here, as well as ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms that, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The riparian states vehemently announced their claim to the new sea areas today.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
&quot;Put simply, the continental shelf is considered that part of the sea floor and its floor that is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the coastal sea, often also the limit of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,&quot; explains Mikulka.
The application that the country in question submits to the Commission for the Determination of the External Boundaries of the Continental Shelf must be backed up by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
&quot;One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far considered five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the latter three countries have succeeded,&quot; Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas, recently met with an international echo.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the seabed expanse the country was given last week by the commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state proper.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
They promise that the future profit they will derive from the use of the seabed will be of inestimable value.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the &quot;Montego Bay Accords&quot;.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor designated by the Convention as &quot;the common heritage of mankind&quot; begins.
No state will then have a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution set up by the Convention.
&quot;But the seabed is not gold mining country,&quot; says Director Mikulka, exaggerating somewhat, adding that its &quot;individual areas are precisely defined by law and the system is contractually anchored.&quot;
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
In 1991, as a result of the convention, it received the status of a so-called &quot;pioneering investor&quot;, as did the investors in a few other countries.
The organization has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is indented there, it is a kind of Tatras on the seabed.
&quot;You can mine there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,&quot; said another jurist, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concrete example with him.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary Shem who, according to legend, brought the Golem to life.
Düsseldorf&#39;s hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of big words in the letter from WestLB&#39;s board of directors to the company&#39;s employees.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with Frankfurt&#39;s Deka-Bank, &quot;the central capital market house of the savings bank finance group&quot; could be created, according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a &quot;competence block&quot; with sustained earning power to such a deal.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the state bank sector.
This is what it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which only recently made it clear to the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk for some time of some kind of connection between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and WestLB - also on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank boss Franz Waas did let it be known when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August that he saw no point in merging the bank on Mainzer Landstrasse with a state bank such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which is borne equally by the state banks and the savings bank associations, has commissioned the management board to hold talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
According to the financial center, the talks have only just begun.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial center of Frankfurt, is not the first to be mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it looked for a moment as if Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came of this alliance of three.
No sooner had the plans become public than the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba participating in them.
The other two houses then did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there have always been speculations about a connection between Deka-Bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, spoke out against planning games about merging with his company.
Irrespective of this, however, there seems to be a growing realization that there is a need for the various houses in the public sector to move closer together.
Now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, the first thing that could come closer is a connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, you will gradually run out of partners.
In the south it would only be a junior partner, although it has weathered the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Savings Banks and Giro Association of Hesse-Thuringia, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to a merger with West LB at the beginning of the year.
At best, Nord LB would remain.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings Banks Association had not yet answered the crucial question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken.
In the end, West LB could also be broken up, although of course this is not wanted there.
The letter from the board of directors there says that an &quot;overall solution&quot; for the house is definitely being sought.
It remains to be seen how this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank.
The second Oktoberfest weekend is known as the &quot;Italian weekend&quot;.
It&#39;s the first time for Elena and the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, by the five-liter Kaiser beer keg, stands a massively built bearded man and shows the 200 or so Oktoberfest travelers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena first slaps Luca, then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova train station, four buses will start at 11:45 p.m. that evening, &quot;destination Monaco, festa della birra&quot;, expected arrival at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, and only Brazilians travel in one bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loudly, says Marco Guarda, that&#39;s not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with a faux fur lining and glasses with wide silver frames.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
Out at night, at the Oktoberfest during the day, back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada in the direction of &quot;Brennero&quot;.
There&#39;s no beer, not yet.
It quickly becomes quiet on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
Good thing, they will still need their strength.
There are stops in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates take another break on the Autobahn 8 just before Munich.
When Marco&#39;s group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past six in the morning, as planned, around 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech and explains the plan of attack.
First: put on the yellow cap.
It says &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; on the left, in fracture, next to it the Internet address of Marco&#39;s travel agency: &quot;conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second: &quot;When the doors to the beer tent open, it&#39;s time to run!&quot; Marco calls out in the morning.
&quot;Run!&quot; Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
&quot;Not in front, otherwise we&#39;ll block, and not distribute all yellow caps on the same benches in the room!&quot;
The measure, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don&#39;t forget to tip.
&quot;Show the security people that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they&#39;re gone!&quot;
Third: &quot;Come back here tonight exactly half past ten!&quot; Understood?
And off we go to the Wiesn.
On the way, one ties yellow caps to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian people&#39;s party as landmarks.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It&#39;s the second Oktoberfest weekend, known as the &quot;Italian Weekend&quot;.
There is no precise information about numbers; we are talking about 50,000 people making their way across the Alps and invading the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have traveled from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics in which the Italians take first place ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies prove.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück just last week.
It&#39;s a good thing that the politician used the word &quot;relatively&quot; and also added that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis developments.
Because that happened over the weekend.
The Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed on the Dax, is receiving a billion-euro loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part that it actually uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background are losses at the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced itself at extremely short notice for long-term projects for which it lent money - which is no longer possible due to the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank&#39;s cash reserves had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, income from write-ups on receivables and certain securities and from the release of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of subsequent offsetting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax code and from agency work for group companies, the drop in income was still moderate at around 16 percent.
After being privatized in 1990, the former state financier initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which were then spun off by Aareal Bank.
Because one earned too little in classic state financing, Depfa then became more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write down the value of the subsidiary, which will have a &quot;significant material effect&quot; on the group&#39;s profit and loss account, it is said quite vaguely.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
For 2007 it had already been cut by two thirds.
Since the Depfa takeover, Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier.
It is more dependent than other institutes on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has largely dried up again as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing part of Depfa&#39;s credit portfolio - around 50 billion euros - every year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group&#39;s financing needs are covered for the foreseeable future with the loan and the company is shielded &quot;from the influence of the international money markets that are currently largely non-functional&quot;.
Other sources say that thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That stands to hope for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and imponderables of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding may not have to be taken in full.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank was reportedly still facing bankruptcy late on Sunday evening, even the at least temporary rescue is not able to calm the mind.
The share price collapses by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up quite well.
While senior debt shows little movement, subordinated debt prices are falling more significantly.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If Hypo-Real-Estate-Bonds used to appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institute itself, which brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of Depfa, than from the stability of the international financial system be considered dependent.
As long as the central banks, governments and less ailing commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the pensions will be repaid on time.
Or something will happen that hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports about the partial nationalization, the probability that bordered on certainty has now only become a legitimate hope.
This should give long-term creditors in particular a few sleepless nights deciding whether they should part with their commitments.
After all, short-term investors can use a closing line to form a loss carryforward for future withholding tax payments on price gains in later years.
German special forces were on site when the hostages were rescued
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When things got serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are emerging about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists who were kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the defense and interior ministries, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, specialists from the Bundeswehr as well as officials from GSG 9, the air force squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief were at the site of the liberation.
However, as spokesmen for the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners go and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany in order to integrate them as support forces on site.
&quot;Fortunately, it didn&#39;t come to that,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the travel group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were trafficked back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the very end, as did the details of the liberation and possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin there was initially no information as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper, the five vacationers and the special forces are to be flown out in an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is totally &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What that means?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she talks about Japan.
&quot;The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited
Even before going to school I was jittery.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the 40 minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way on my own, luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
The beginning of the lesson doesn&#39;t seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
The students trundle in from eight o&#39;clock until a short round of discussions with the teacher begins at twenty to nine, the &#39;home room&#39;.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I&#39;m not the type who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn&#39;t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, a blouse, blue knee-high socks and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the desk in this outfit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: &#39;Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...&#39; - my name is Sylvana, I&#39;m from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language a good two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were all whispering, giggling, and waving, and I kept hearing the word &quot;Kawaii.&quot;
I already knew that from my manga.
It is part of the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means &#39;cute, sweet&#39;.
Then I quickly scurried to my seat.
The girl next to me was grinning quite widely, feeling honored that the exchange student should be sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was fairly quiet, but when the gong rang I was literally assailed.
Everyone was chattering and giggling and asking me questions in the stomach - it&#39;s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother also made me a lunch box like that - it&#39;s something different than the boring German lunches.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat wrapped in tofu.
Most of the time I have no clue what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely novel.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except maybe for the salty pickled plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a bento that she has made herself, which she then prepares in a particularly artistic way - in the hope of getting to know the boy better over a snack during breaks.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I&#39;m curious if I can watch it here too.
&#39;Why Japan?&#39; my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
&quot;Because it fascinates me.&quot;
After all, I&#39;ve loved reading manga for years.
And so that I could better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So it was absolutely clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a soft spot for tradition, manners and customs.
And that is very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven&#39;t felt lost here either, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has just failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones plummeted.
The US House of Representatives rejected the government&#39;s financial bailout package by a vote of 206 to 227.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets failed to win a majority.
In a dramatic action, the supporters tried desperately to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had urged lawmakers to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get political credit for avoiding something that hasn&#39;t happened yet,&quot; he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concerns that the government rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to crash again after the failure became known.
Experts are now anticipating further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the program to come into force.
Rats have feelings too
A rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean it feels fear too?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
But how could you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
For several years, articles by famous scientists have been published in the Internet journal &quot;Edge&quot;.
In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question &quot;What do you think is true without being able to prove it?&quot;
I believe that animals have sentience and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove this since we can&#39;t even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and bring up questions of sentience or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware doesn&#39;t match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: it plays dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don&#39;t believe in that though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to extrapolate our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one, the circuitry almost always associated with human consciousness includes the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and executive/controlling functions).
This broad region is much more highly developed in man than in other primates, and appears to be entirely absent in other creatures.
So, at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and being able to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans are different even from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of human beings: since such a large part of our experience is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case one could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, language would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed by our own experience, then its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of what I have said relates to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that may be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could study the processes of consciousness in animals regardless of their contents, and that is what is done in studies of primate short-term memory, particularly in the case of visualization.
But the approach pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for visualization to occur.
What are the feelings now?
I attribute it to an emotional system like fear being activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
So, what we call &quot;fear&quot; is the mental state we are in when the activity of the brain&#39;s defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
In this sense, sensation is closely tied to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates, and humans in particular.
Connected to the linguistic nature, there are fine gradations of perception, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to ascribe them to others as well as ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, suggests that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the bodily sensory regions of the cortex and brainstem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genus sensations.
In theory I can&#39;t disagree with that, but I think it&#39;s unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears like fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees from danger, does it feel fear too?
In my view, mere behavioral similarity cannot prove equality of experience.
The neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brainstems, while cockroaches don&#39;t even have a brain.
But is the brainstem responsible for sensation?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how would you prove it for rats?
I believe rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sentience.
But I don&#39;t know how to prove that.
And because their sensations are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness relies on specialized circuitry and language), I prefer to study rats&#39; emotional behavior rather than emotional sensations.
In any case, progress on the neural level beckons here, provided that the same measurements are made in rats and humans.
Just as I don&#39;t study language and consciousness in rats, neither do sensations, yet I don&#39;t know if they exist.
It may seem short-sighted, but I&#39;d rather make progress than keep running into a wall.
I&#39;m just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
&quot;The government sees Uefa&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland,&quot; said Wasjunik.
&quot;But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still a lot to do in both countries.&quot;
The two hosts are behind schedule for the construction or renovation of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of EM stadiums may even be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can&#39;t waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now,&quot; said Ukrainian federation president Grigory Surkis.
&quot;UEFA will keep a constant eye on us.&quot;
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish federation PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is &quot;a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
&quot;We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparations for the EM 2012 will not suffer as a result.&quot;
Several first division teams were sentenced to forced relegation for manipulation in the past season alone, after all, even the start of the league had to be postponed at short notice.
Organizers are registering increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, sales of travel bookings for the coming months have risen significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, Germans&#39; desire to travel remains undiminished despite the weak economic prospects.
With bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
According to the DRV, the increase in sales by travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies every month and extrapolates it for the entire market.
The travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Because of the weak dollar, trips to the United States are particularly popular, the DRV said.
The increase in bookings here is around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the home regions are particularly popular travel destinations for Germans.
Package tours in particular are very popular, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs for energy and food, the costs here are &quot;easier for the customer to calculate than for individually organized holidays&quot;.
Laepple explained that consumers could save money with early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, among other things.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who went on a trip fell compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about private things in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her ex Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and hits back.
Belated war of roses with the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an ugly argument with each other – in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time and that was very painful.&quot;
She only found out about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan&#39;s press work for her new film &quot;The Women&quot; - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to his coming out as an unfaithful husband was clear: &quot;Outrageous&quot;, the 54-year-old told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; that &quot;Meg is repeating and rewriting the story of our relationship again and again&quot;.
It is also &quot;regrettable&quot; that their 16-year-old son Jack is again &quot;publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that divorce means for every child.&quot;
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father to twins.
And so his statements end with the swipe: &quot;In any case, my life goes on.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing well.&quot;
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have even become up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant slump in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was clearest in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate as the reason for this, which has led to a &quot;declining desire to travel among American tourists&quot;.
Financial centers such as Frankfurt or London are also more severely affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in flight prices was also upwards in the first quarter:
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, travelers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, economy class airline ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in business and first class were much smaller.
In Germany, prices collapsed even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, prices on German domestic flights have even halved.
The company explains that the reason for the collapse in prices is on the one hand slowing economic growth.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV becomes the leader of the table.
Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven at Borussia.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge Crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lob on the crossbar.
His message was precisely worded, it flowed convincingly from his lips.
He just knew he was right.
&quot;We need the second goal,&quot; hissed Hermann Rieger in the cabin aisle of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some past players.
And so his request found a hearing at the responsible level.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and thumbed up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg&#39;s head coach Martin Jol.
His command must have been similar: Bring on gate two!
The implementation failed.
&quot;Not everything was nice to look at today,&quot; Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have &quot;desired it to be more relaxed&quot;.
Hamburg owe the 1-0 (1-0) to Mladen Petric&#39;s header (11&#39;); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
&quot;It was a dirty win,&quot; concluded Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV turns 121 this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators were already celebrating themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which identified their club as the class leader.
It&#39;s going to be a birthday without a real party.
&quot;We know how to classify that,&quot; said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim report stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team, with their late signings - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalscorer Petric and Jansen, who was poached from FC Bayern - is slowly finding its way, but is not yet able to shine.
&quot;We need more flair and more dribbling,&quot; Jol demanded.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter mugs and celebrities in designer dirndls.
A Oktoberfest debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don&#39;t have much in common.
She is blonde, a TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I&#39;m a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Barely three minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers are already pouncing on us and taking full pictures of the memory cards - very flattering and that on my first visit to the Oktoberfest.
That&#39;s how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually based north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in traditional costume has been limited up to now.
But once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, everything isn&#39;t that bad.
Almost everyone wears a dirndl or lederhosen; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all perfectly normal.
Only my dirndl apron gets strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to the fact that I tied the apron incorrectly: &quot;Left hoast free, middle Jungfrau, right taken, widowed at the back.&quot;
I secretly fiddle with the loop from the back to the left.
&quot;Fits&quot;, it said and laughs.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt hats that say &quot;To drunk to get dressed!&quot; stands and uninvited stretch out their bare behind.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and is also attending the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it&#39;s &quot;gorgeous&quot;, with a long drawn out &quot;ooooo&quot;.
That&#39;s what he tells me after he&#39;s drained his previous mug.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious &quot;wild bees&quot;.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o&#39;clock in the evening paramedics flock to the fairground to take care of the poor wretches.
The nurses always appear in packs - four at a time carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works the same as with most Wiesn visitors: go empty, come back full.
You can&#39;t see who&#39;s lying under the tarpaulin in the blood alcohol coffin.
&quot;These are the ones that always grab,&quot; one of the paramedics called out to me on request and disappeared into the turmoil.
After the voting loss
Fear is rampant on Wall Street.
The first news that the rescue package had failed caused the Dow Jones to drop by 700 points at times.
That was the biggest single-day loss of points in its history.
The Dow later recovered somewhat.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was down a good five percent at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at that time was American Express in the Dow, which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could win.
Goldman Sachs shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Major investor Warren Buffett had invested in the company just a few days ago.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for buying up so-called bad mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid out all at once, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock options from the financial companies, which could be redeemed if the share price develops accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on the state coffers.
Share prices in Europe and the USA in a downward pull
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the USA do not eliminate investors&#39; doubts.
The share price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and pulls the Dax down.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pulled the German share index (Dax) deep into the red.
Despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, the shares of the Munich real estate financier temporarily lost three quarters of their value, Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6,000 point mark and was down 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world collapsed.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared the US government&#39;s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to get financial markets moving again.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could follow on October 1st.
The other European stock exchanges only knew one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the leading Japanese index, the Nikkei, fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
Arcandor shares in the MDax fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects spacecraft flight
For years, researchers have been perplexed by a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because the fuel lines will soon freeze, she is now threatened with cold death.
A mysterious phenomenon has been confusing scientists for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver by space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
What has puzzled the researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect based on the time-honoured law of gravitation.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes speed up or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They dubbed it the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was right and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have detected in the universe.
&quot;Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,&quot; he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for around ten years.
It obviously has an attractive force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the scientists&#39; calculations, dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostage-takers are said to have been killed in a shootout before the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are said to be already underway.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: &quot;Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We&#39;re checking her health right now,&quot; Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and well, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
&quot;The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,&quot; the officer said.
It was &quot;only a matter of receiving the hostages&quot; when suddenly &quot;this surprise&quot; came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over to one of the hostages by the German wife.
The daily newspaper &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot;, citing a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
The name of the victim of the accident was released by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been released.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon&#39;s crash on Shenfield Road in the town centre.
She was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital in Romford but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of careless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Stepfather&#39;s abuse &#39;led to suicide&#39;
Years of abuse from her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has been told.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: &quot;I feel responsible for her death.&quot;
The court learned that Mrs Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise bound her and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away working in a public house.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse she was subjected to twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said Ms Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been &quot;emotionally dead&quot; since 2006 and had &quot;given up her life&quot;.
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead at her Plymouth flat.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: &quot;I used to tie her up and blindfold her.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t sexually assault her.
I feel responsible for her death.&quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: &quot;You are an extremely disconcerting fetishist and it must have been terrifying for your victim, especially as she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim&#39;s suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended up in court had she not done so.&quot;
He added: &quot;I take note of the impact, as described by Stephanie&#39;s father and mother, her actions have had on their daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.&quot;
Officials in charge of lost data face charges
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost highly confidential documents on a train in June will be charged under the &quot;Public Safety Act&quot;.
The man was seconded from the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents were given to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge in the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action came as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: &quot;You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Department of Defense and the Cabinet.&quot;
The employee, whose name cannot be released, is being charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safekeeping of information.
The Royal Prosecutor&#39;s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police over the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he misplaced included classified assessments of al Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken from his home to an undisclosed location.
Housing associations are eyeing B&amp;B costs
UK housing associations could face costs of more than £80m following the Bradford and Bingley Bank bailout.
The Government provided £14bn to protect the deposits of Bradford &amp; Bingley&#39;s 2.6m customers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The General Manager of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was &quot;unbearable&quot; that the societies and their members would have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid when Bradford &amp; Bingley&#39;s loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is accrued each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in that figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently... are now being called upon to pick up some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450m in 2009.
That means the companies will have to raise £81m for the first year&#39;s interest.
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the Association of Housing Associations, told the BBC he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the housing boom are now being called upon to foot some of the costs of institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records began in 1945.
&quot;We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives exist to protect housing associations and their members from potentially significant costs.&quot;
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year and that could be nearly double that.
Because building societies are mutual, non-shareholder organizations, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Türkiye broadens diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey&#39;s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 paces inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavour.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
At least that&#39;s what the guidebooks tell you.
The building sits astride the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner in front, giving the appearance of some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart
But once inside the domed ticket office, there is no doubting the grandeur of the project of which this was the westernmost entrance.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, a latecomer in the imperialist game, intended to pursue its ambitions of dominating the Middle East via a rail link to Damascus, Baghdad, and further out to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany&#39;s imperialist projects flagged during the First World War.
Its railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
British forces advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train blew up, destroying the ornate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly decayed, largely passed over by history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, to mark the broadening of Turkey&#39;s diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighboring regions created by Cold War borders has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP&#39;s top foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, some ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the old-world lockstep in the well-known documentary &quot;The Night Mail,&quot; I arrived in the Turkish capital, designated as the new city for the new secular state project to turn their backs on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has sparked some mistrust in the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP&#39;s headquarters, a purpose-built, ultra-modern stone and steel structure in a developing suburb surrounded by half-completed shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met around the close first deals of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Suit, tie, I&#39;m sure he even packed a Blackberry.
&quot;The goal of the party&#39;s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbors.
The Cold War was exceptional,&quot; he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from her hinterland.
Nowadays she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
&quot;But surely at some point,&quot; I asked, &quot;Turkey could be forced to make a choice?&quot;
&quot;Turkey,&quot; he said, &quot;did not want to face that decision.&quot;
He then emphasized a point that nearly everyone I spoke to here repeated almost routinely: Turkey&#39;s relations, not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, figuratively, Europe as a whole can travel east towards Asia and the Middle East on those same railroad tracks.
Back at the Hydarpashas train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of those two German gentlemen, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this structure 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe&#39;s Middle East ambitions could now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry that would take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called &quot;the sick man of Europe&quot; in those days.
Back then, at least, there didn&#39;t seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating land.
Milk will be five pence a liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by a further five pence a liter from Monday.
It&#39;s the second price hike this year, following a twopence hike in February, and comes after investigations were carried out by a consultancy.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
The wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002 before the price increase in February.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defense attorneys said the court refused bail on charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, has demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that although she has been granted parole to go abroad for medical treatment, as part of her release it is not clear if she will be able to remain at large if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to the Supreme Court.
&quot;The High Court denied Sheikh Hasina&#39;s bail request because it says she does not need bail as she is already on parole abroad to receive treatment abroad,&quot; her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court.&quot;
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for December&#39;s elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami alliance party leader said Sunday.
She was jailed last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of violence linked to the Taliban, the United Nations said.
The United Nations rolled out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban&#39;s promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of workers carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission&#39;s decision to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court of Appeal has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB&#39;s stake distorted competition and gave it unfair influence over broadcaster ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB&#39;s purchase of the stake in ITV cast doubt on ITV&#39;s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to open an inquiry.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and communications office Ofcom have all opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was an unreasonable and excessive move, particularly given that BskyB had announced it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor&#39;s affair
The US Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the 2006 firing of the nine US prosecutors.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of the administration staff.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was fueled by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now tasked with clarifying whether the officers interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal activities, have not been fully investigated or resolved, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine US prosecutors from their posts in December 2006.
At that point, the ministry argued that prosecutors were being fired due to poor job performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their peers, leading many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors have been involved in prosecuting senior Republican congressmen, while others have refused to investigate allegations of Democratic voter fraud.
US prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Justice Department, has come under fire over the firings and has effectively resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general&#39;s report was particularly critical of Gonzales&#39; role, saying he bore &quot;principal responsibility&quot; for the sackings, &quot;abandoned his leadership role&quot; and showed &quot;extraordinarily disinterestedness&quot; in the process
Other officials, including former chief aide to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with investigators.
Meat Loaf&#39;s epic song is to be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic anthem &#39;Bat Out Of Hell&#39; during the &#39;Q Awards&#39; music awards ceremony.
The singer, who is set to accept his special gold award during the awards ceremony in London next week, said he was honored to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf&#39;s hit 1977 album.
&quot;Coldplay&quot; leads the nominations for this year&#39;s awards after being shortlisted in four categories.
Q Magazine Editor-in-Chief Paul Rees said there are some songs that transcend such matters as time and genre and &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; is certainly one of them.
The song, penned by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice, which was provided by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf&#39;s &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; has spent about nine years on the charts and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been suffering from serious health issues in recent years. One of them was surgery in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in the city, often forgotten and possibly for sale soon
New York City has thousands of thoroughfares, avenues, side streets and other ring roads, some famous and some just convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it&#39;s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
Located in the East Village, this tiny street runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alleyway than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no street signs.
It&#39;s practically impossible to find them on a standard street map.
However, this street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer that recently erected luxury buildings on First Street.
It intends to repave Extra Place to create a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the longtime neighborhood, which says it&#39;s intrigued by the short alleyway simply because it&#39;s one of the remnants of the block&#39;s past.
But the city government department in charge of protecting and constructing the residential buildings and in charge of the road has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the borough council&#39;s land use committee earlier this month, city officials and Avalon Bay officials drafted a proposal for the developer to purchase the road.
Still, the committee prefers the road to remain in city hands and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the precinct officer on Parish Council 3.
&quot;Very little space remains city-owned and we want Extra Place to remain city-owned,&quot; she said.
&quot;There could be offers to fix and operate the road, which Avalon could do, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed.&quot;
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would repave the small street and add seats intended for, among other things, a café to which the company plans to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during this month&#39;s session.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it didn&#39;t necessarily want to own it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s primary concern is to renovate this derelict laneway and turn it into a public meeting place,&quot; she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was indeed the city&#39;s desire to sell the street, stressing that the department&#39;s job is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood, The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical appeal.
Some believe the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the Ramones album &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the November 1976 photo.
The street was full of scrap metal, rags and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have dismissed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, humble as it is, should remain public.
Others have hailed Extra Place as a rarity — a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called &quot;Jeremiah&#39;s Vanishing New York&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City&quot;), published part of the city&#39;s history talk about Extra Place that appeared in the magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was published in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: &quot;Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal warehouse doors, locked windows and week-old newspapers flying past gutters&quot;.
With few exceptions, this is exactly how the street looked one evening recently.
A rat ran through the back of the street not far from the door that used to lead to CBGB, which now houses a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti covered the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested the road could use some sprucing up.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp, and gross.
Debate on Bilingual Education: Education in English-speaking Environments
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates&#39; positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research fellow in Californian Studies and senior director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of Not As Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choices.
Reaching out to Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama&#39;s proposals on education are a case in point.
Obama&#39;s campaign notes that &quot;African American and Hispanic students are less likely to graduate than white students&quot; - which is true.
To close this performance gap, Obama&#39;s curriculum specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in education for those just learning English.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes instruction in languages other than English, conflicts with his interest in closing the academic achievement gap.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in east Los Angeles, as an example.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are new to the country, are learning English.
Yet, in 2008, an astounding 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state math exam with a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English test.
This amazing success was achieved using methods different from those favored by Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes verification and practice, constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach of providing education in an English-speaking environment. That&#39;s the point Obama should be aware of, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in subject teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me the school had had remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would walk into the classroom and not recognize him.
&quot;It works,&quot; she noted, &quot;it works for us.&quot;
Would Obama use a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Hispanic and other English learners?
The school&#39;s accomplishments would make that question easy to answer, but the educational positions within his own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama&#39;s response uncertain.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about &quot;English-only&quot; legislation.
Instead, he said, &quot;You should make sure your child knows Spanish.&quot;
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despising and trivializing them.
Oil prices fall on renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even America&#39;s financial market bailout plan might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price is down more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to almost $90 a barrel this month, only to bounce back on the back of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors again expressed concerns on Monday, even as congressional officials said they agreed over the weekend on what would be the largest bailout plan in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend leading to a bailout plan, markets seem to have failed to revive sentiment.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to fall further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that goods markets will also be affected.
&quot;From a commodity markets perspective, what we are most concerned about is whether the US virus is spreading globally, particularly to China.&quot;
The bank&#39;s analysts have lowered their expectations for oil consumption in the coming year due to weak economic growth, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Central defender Shaun Ellis thought he&#39;d seen it all, having featured in the Jets jersey more times than anyone over the past eight-and-a-half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumph.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; Ellis said.
The second quarter began after a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals to match the inclement weather.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre&#39;s pass got through to Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon that saw their evolving collaboration take a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one slipping as a full-back and the other with 10 seconds remaining at halftime.
&quot;I wasn&#39;t trying very hard,&quot; says Coles of the passes that went to Coles.
&quot;He&#39;s a super player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think.&quot;
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense took apart quarterback Kurt Warner.
Fullback Darrelle Revis intercepted a failed throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused Warner to lose.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets regained the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot for a 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Erik Mangini replied, &quot;The second quarter or the third quarter?&quot;
Responding to both, as the Jets conceded 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single one, Mangini said, &quot;Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been scored in a short time.&quot;
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again why some consider him the greatest long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in Sunday&#39;s Berlin marathon and became the first person to complete the 42.2-kilometer distance in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
Victory on the flat course in 2:03:59 saw Gebrselassie improve by 27 seconds on his previous result of 2:04:26 he achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in a varied career in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every distance from a kilometer to a marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon over fears, perhaps exaggerated in hindsight, that air pollution was making his asthma problems worse.
Instead, he registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya switched to long-distance, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06: 05 won.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that two weeks ago he had cramps in his calf and was unable to train for a week.
Apparently he came back from the break refreshed and not rusty.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy,&quot; he told reporters.
&quot;Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and I still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great.&quot;
He has been criticized - particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s East African rival - for overly orchestrating his races, generally eschewing many of the world&#39;s top marathon stars, over-relying on race leaders as if this were a track race, and setting world records above competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the middle of the course in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers faltered.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final attempt to part ways with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, capped off a remarkable year by posting the seventh fastest finish of all time in 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing games due to what was described as a back injury. However, she bounced back to win in Berlin and improve her personal best by five minutes in her third marathon.
She planned her run cleverly, allowing a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to break away, but overtook them after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop of Kenya was third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships of black life in a very special city
Tucked among the outskirts of Orlando&#39;s amusement parks, a few miles from the glitzy, noisy, and gargantuan bustle, lies a quiet city that showcases the pride and complications of African-American culture.
Eatonville, the first all-black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: &quot;the city of 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no jail.&quot;
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city it describes—and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Depression-era Florida guidebook produced by the federal writers project—is and remains in many ways a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who &quot;knows so little about us that he doesn&#39;t know what escapes him.&quot;
Even now, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about race relations, many here remain weary of being watched by outsiders.
&quot;We&#39;re very careful about how our story is told,&quot; said Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a parishioner of the city&#39;s oldest church.
It has to be right.&quot;
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 residents where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is both a literary stronghold and an example of—sometimes condemned, sometimes praised—black culture of the rural South, rooted in American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and wary.
And the concerns about Eatonville&#39;s image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in vernacular, such as &#39;Mules and Men&#39; (1953) and &#39;Their Eyes Were Watching God&#39; (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide transformed the city, which sits just off Route 77, a road that cuts through the often-forgotten heart of Florida, into the settings of black history and human drama.
Cheeky like Oscar in both real life and fiction, Hurston took readers to the store of Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
&quot;Off the road on the left,&quot; she wrote, &quot;is the brown-and-white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playground, which Howard Miller always tends to, although he can barely read and write.&quot;
She also mentioned Widow Dash&#39;s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn &quot;sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits hourly rooms.&quot;
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriages, and sex.
This was definitely not a guide book.
Indeed, this was not a portrait appreciated by all.
&quot;Zora described things as they were,&quot; said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston, citing the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual innuendos.
She added, &quot;Some people didn&#39;t like this.&quot;
Hurtson is still remembered here as a feisty eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston roared into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking, and dressed in pants in a city that even today prides itself on its venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
&quot;People were always happy to see Zora,&quot; Mr Franklin said.
But &quot;she never lingered too long,&quot; he added, rocking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely christened.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unnamed grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no grand commemoration, no grand public readings.
&quot;I don&#39;t think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turning point came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to build a five-lane freeway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community&#39;s slow two-lane main street.
Orlando&#39;s suburbs had already pushed Freeway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the community&#39;s relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950&#39;s, the fight against miscegenation brought hatred into the community.
&quot;During that time a bunch of white boys would often come and throw oranges and stuff at the people sitting to one side,&quot; Mr Franklin said.
&quot;There was even a woman who was killed doing it.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.&quot;
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court&#39;s requirement to enforce integration, calling its decision in the Brown v. School Board case &quot;offensive rather than respectful of my race.&quot;
Residents now say that while desegregation was positive in some ways, it weakened Eatonville&#39;s group cohesion and the self-esteem of its youth.
&quot;Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher at night,&quot; said NY Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group protecting the Eatonville community .
This could be sustained, she added, until teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
&quot;You didn&#39;t hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there&#39;s a cultural divide,&quot; Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who defied prejudice like she did, with positive self-esteem and statements like, &quot;How can anyone have the joy deny my company!
I do not get it.&quot;
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston&#39;s unnamed grave and began fighting to rekindle her fame.
Five years later, a critically acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookshelves, re-establishing it as part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville&#39;s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston&#39;s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the construction of the freeway could destroy the county.
Thousands of fans turned out for the inaugural event two years later, and each January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road building plans.
&quot;Plans for a five-lane highway revitalized the city, accelerated the whole thing to top speed, aroused real civic pride,&quot; Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms Boyd put it a little more simply: &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city&#39;s self-image.
More and more newcomers arrived, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past anew.
Eatonville was added to the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida specialty: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880&#39;s.
(She&#39;s 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville&#39;s history and significance are still often treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and certain items - such as the mural on Eatonville&#39;s oldest church, which was painted by a white man and depicts black men working in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear her closed-off community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival was growing, so was a heightened sense of homeland pride.
Young people, especially, tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative, and hardworking, silly, and mixed-race as any other racial or ethnic group in America.
It is the genuine love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin&#39;s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in city government or the police force, who he says could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;Most people just driving through here will think, &#39;Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,&#39;&quot; Alondra Kenon said one Sunday after church the other day.
&quot;But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it&#39;s a very beautiful city.&quot;
Here in New York, financial Latin is spoken fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and massive television screens of Times Square, they would not even realize they were in the midst of a debacle.
They would never believe that overhead, in the glass-fronted, shoebox-like offices, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face their worst horrible working day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Vendors still clatter metal tea trolleys along sidewalks, carrying trays loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still shuffle between apartments like human pack animals laden with 50+ ironed T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole slung over their shoulders.
Office workers still wait for their breakfast bagels at sidewalk food stands, and it&#39;s still impossible to get a yellow cab between 4pm and 7pm on a weekday.
It didn&#39;t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, because of all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to time my obligatory walk to the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the ATMs to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counters where regular customers order check books, tourists ask directions to Macy&#39;s, and where new customers open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my &quot;licensed personal banker,&quot; lined up for the same reason I did.
however, unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a building society), credit unions and those local thrifts that only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into receivership and as New Yorkers drove home for the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the clerks waiting in line before me took their cash to a bank considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of Wall Street&#39;s bailouts.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become fluent in financial Latin over the past few weeks.
A woman on the phone at my local Chinese supermarket referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its emaciated-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, with as much familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, my apartment block&#39;s uniformed concierge in her 50s, has strayed from our usual conversations about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
&quot;I now have all my savings in money market funds,&quot; she told me after my visit to the bank.
&quot;I switched, I&#39;m not taking any more risks.&quot;
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford&#39;s Musical Director since 1962, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he formed his magnificent youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to the age of 21, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (the mythological shape-shifter) represented the choir&#39;s willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music that was put before them, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a cappella or with full orchestra .
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting and existed solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which never waned over the years.
How many times did Death urge us to &quot;let the music speak for itself&quot;.
He used to say: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.&quot;
It&#39;s all in the music.
So sing it!&quot;
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never imperious but also never exuberant.
Whatever the musical level, he always demanded something even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years or so I&#39;ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say I&#39;ve never been disappointed by a single one - many times I&#39;ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, in his words, simply &quot;peddled a well-known show horse or two around the world.&quot;
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that &quot;in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship...while at the same time pursuing a BSc, a MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author&#39;s note in Woodruff&#39;s book, Beyond Nab End, but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a Lecturer in Economic History at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British Rubber Industry under the supervision of Professor JD Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 on a Houblon-Norman fellowship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a leftist from Austria&#39;s right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of Belgium&#39;s right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp, Thursday January 17, 2008, in support of the organization &#39;Cities against Islamization &quot; to represent.
They carry road sign-style signs depicting a mosque crossed out with a red line.
Police have accused far-right extremists of desecrating a grave at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right parties made significant gains in the country&#39;s general election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were badly damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the graves, but detectives say this is an attempt to disguise the motive of the extremists, who are driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by the news of the grave desecration, which came as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, Austria is facing a round of soul-searching after the country slid to the right in yesterday&#39;s general election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that garnered almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for strict anti-immigrant legislation and some of their slogans have been criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even voiced his aversion to foods commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a &quot;European brotherhood&quot; to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, showing that the far right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters concerned about their future in the European Union make.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sex abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges gave Glitter a six-month ban after he informed authorities controlling him that he was planning to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted an international travel ban last Thursday after giving judges evidence of Glitter&#39;s criminal record for child sex abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent but was represented by the law firm of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court said: &quot;On Thursday 25 September Kent Police applied to Ashford Magistrates Court for permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from traveling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person.&quot;
As required by the Sex Offenders Registry, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities he intended to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he intends to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify authorities could result in a 5 year prison sentence.
Kent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter&#39;s possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent&#39;s Police Unit said: &quot;Police in Kent will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.&quot;
&quot;We think it&#39;s easier to check someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system in place to effectively prevent any potential risk.&quot;
&quot;Protecting the people of Kent is a priority for Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that may pose to the community.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting 2 girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok where he was scheduled to catch a flight to London.
But he said he wasn&#39;t feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn&#39;t let him through passport control and after some back and forth he flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he return to the UK.
Eventually, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his solicitor, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Magistrates&#39; Court in west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for permission to require that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
According to the Home Office, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter has been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master backstage to capture his character&#39;, Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffle, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to have a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private lives, into those moments that are alien to the audience, I know when to make gestures typical of personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands worried that they will not enter the stage, Can be found.
In his project `Flamenco-people&#39;, the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts varied theatricality of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this suggestion, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, part of the program of Flamenco Photography Month, `reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is increasing day by day,&#39; explains the artist, making it clear that `Flamenco people&#39; are `anyone can be human, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
Ordinary people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
You don&#39;t need to take photos on stage to capture the personality of these performers.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with my camera&#39;.
Bauer, inspired by the `Cante de las Minas&#39; festival, went on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera&#39;s image sorting function and the available material, images were created that are reminiscent of classic photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture, giving the picture modernity and the idea of how the peasant understands flamenco: `music with traditional roots, changing and surprising every day&#39;.
It&#39;s not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing itself, but the artist&#39;s personality, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the El Fotómata gallery in the near future.
Well-known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of the nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer&#39;s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as &#39;portraits of sports veterans&#39; (&#39;SportARTproject&#39;).
Although the concepts of the `Flamenco-people&#39; project are different, the photographer admits `I really enjoy photographing people, getting to know them and putting myself in their state of life, be it for a brief moment or a longer one Time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or bump into people, personalities that you sometimes don&#39;t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.&#39;
The collection of portraits of flamenco today, entitled `Flamenco-people&#39;, is exhibited in the El Fotómata gallery, located on the street called la calle de la Mata, parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is &#39;a foolhardiness&#39;.
He doesn&#39;t yet know where the novel&#39;s plot takes place and what it&#39;s about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he&#39;s working on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favorite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is working on is &#39;a foolhardy thing&#39; and &#39;everything indicates that he wouldn&#39;t have to write the novel&#39;.
`If I had more sense I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel someday&#39;, thus concluding his participation in the festival where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros&#39; was one of the most prominent figures at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, winner of the Hay Festival Premium and voted for by most of those present, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend&#39; and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theater.
Introduced by Félix Romeo, he found that he had an audience that realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go over everything again: like his A vocation for literature arose, which emerged from &#39;extraordinary thirst for adventure&#39;, from &#39;joy of reading&#39; and from &#39;wanting to experience more than before&#39;; how he writes and `maintains discipline&#39; to complement `the lack of inspiration&#39;, his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what &#39;memory images&#39; form the basis of his stories.
The Hispanic novelist acknowledged that there is &#39;no way&#39; by which to measure or know whether books are life-changing, &#39;but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience &#39; stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it &#39;creates effects&#39; and &#39;disconnects people even more&#39;, so I asked writers to &#39;don&#39;t succumb to levity&#39; and &#39;take responsibility&#39; for his vocation.
The weather did not cooperate at the festival in Pozoblanco: some bullfighting festivals were cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters realized that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival that was supposed to end the festival in Pozoblanco was postponed to yesterday morning.
So the organizers, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
The festival was exposed to the unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
It rained on Saturday, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullring one by one.
So there was only one party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after exiting the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante struck two of the bull&#39;s horns and an ear, more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After fencing so poorly, much of the crowd responded with boos during his second bout.
In Álava, two people tried to evade inspection of their car loaded with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the driver of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they wouldn&#39;t have to stop with a load of more than two thousand kilos of hash.
Police gave chase and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28, known as AAJ, according to the Basque country&#39;s interior ministry.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident happened when officers from the Álava Region Traffic Police had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the Armiñon urban area.
They decided to stop a car to conduct route control. The driver did not follow instructions, suddenly increased speed and tried to evade control.
The police officers began the pursuit until the car stopped at the shoulder after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee down a country road into a wooded area.
Ertzaintza city police eventually caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2.178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with bundles of hash, which were later sent to other police stations for detailed laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles.
In addition, the officers found that the number plate was &#39;duplicate&#39;, so that it did not match the number plate given in the vehicle documents, which is why an arrest was also made for falsifying official documents.
The Ertzaintza City Police Department is continuing the investigation with a view to arresting the second suspect, who, as previously mentioned, managed to escape, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
The arrested AAJ, 28, was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be brought before the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for driving while under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, best known for playing Amanda on Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving while under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness observed her trying to pull out of her parking spot in Montecito in a rather strange manner, a spokesman for the California Traffic Police Department told People magazine.
The witness detailed that after 4:30 p.m., Locklear &#39;put the accelerator on the floor and made a lot of noise trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she backed up she grabbed hers a few times Sunglasses&#39;.
A little later, the witness, who may not have recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear pull up on a nearby road and get out of the car.
The witness was the person who called emergency services because she was &#39;fearful for Locklear&#39;s life&#39;.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, parked across the street, blocking traffic.
`She seemed disoriented&#39;, so the police took her to a special drug and alcohol center to be tested.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `Based on initial observations by officers, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,&#39; the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and was taken to a local detention center around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian federation of the United Left should take charge of the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, has assured today that the regional federation for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former youth and sports councilor of Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva , who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases I am a big federalist and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for it,&#39; Llamazares pointed out what the party&#39;s approach to the one who until now sits as a councilor in the Seville municipal council is .
Despite this, the VL chairman defended the need for `transparency&#39; in the possible investigations into rule violations that Silva may have started: `The VL always insisted that such cases be given the maximum transparency&#39;.
Regarding this issue, he stressed that education has &#39;a strict code of ethics for all public offices&#39;.
`Sangre de mayo&#39;: Heroic book by Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós&#39; &#39;Episodios Nacionales&#39;, in &#39;Sangre de mayo&#39; José Luis Carci presents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with an investment of around 15 million euros for the shooting.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried `to present a multitude of personalities and social analysis&#39;, something he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film starring Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, at the beginning of a long list of the Actor.
`Sangre de mayo&#39;, which is over two and a half hours long, will be released in cinemas this Friday and will later be shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós&#39; literature, affirms that thanks to this filming his &#39;childhood dream&#39; has come true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second centenary celebrations on November 2nd in Madrid. Mainly because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales&#39;, he accepted the job.
The total contribution of 15 million provided by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for the filming, he added, offers Garci the &#39;unique opportunity&#39;, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, to portray the image of &#39;confused Spain, choosing the wrong leader for the fight chosen because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII&#39;.
However, the cineast regrets that he could not count on financing like `Alatriste&#39; or `Los fantasmas de Goya&#39; (twice as high as `Sangre de mayo&#39;), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel could not be included with whom Garci worked for most of his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar&#39;, contributed through his usual way of working: he placed himself on the stage with the actors with whom it is necessary to rehearse before starting to shoot and for those who had not done any casting he came across as `humiliating&#39; and inspiring respect, `part of being a film director is providing help in the theater and cinema, to know what is happening in the cinema industry you work in.&#39;
Many of the actors he encounters in `Sangre de mayo&#39; have to repeat themselves in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he won one), believes and affirmed that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo&#39;, nor `Siete mesas de billar francés&#39; and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos&#39;.
Garci doesn&#39;t expect any awards for this film.
`In the beginning you think you are working for offspring, later you realize that it is only for prosperity, and now you are satisfied if you have produced another film,&#39; explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for women&#39;s emancipation, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which restricted free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested me this role, which seemed impossible to me.&#39;
`We try not to talk about her life but to keep her spirit alive,&#39; said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance basics helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, `The Dance of the Butterfly&#39; seemed like Guajira to me, or `The Dance of the Snake&#39; like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I&#39;ve been told that my dancing is also in that aesthetic realm,&#39; she claims.
The production counts on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerta abierta&#39;; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-pupils.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I&#39;m happy that she agreed to be a part of my work and I&#39;m very honored.&#39;
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he `takes on the role of the accompanist of the artists who were divas with whom he falls in love again and again.&#39;
This work also narrates in a certain way the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
`I wanted to commemorate her because I think she is one of those women who had a huge impact on a certain era and whose work is no longer appreciated and therefore even less appreciated,&#39; Bayón claims.
The show will take place today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theater.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life&#39; because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them for their simplicity and for the power they exude, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.&#39;
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado&#39; also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado&#39; at Saint Stephen&#39;s Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to present planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón&#39; (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
Thus `the triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón&#39; will end with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the traveling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz&#39;, which opened in May and, after being in different places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council of Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado&#39; edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make known the person and the work of the Andalusian poet of the world.
The USA can hardly imagine itself without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.&#39;
This phrase comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in &#39;Sensation Reporter&#39;, and from the then dominant notion of US cinema, which was let down by all of America until Newman came with his thrilling notion and followed it.
Now look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a big blow to everyone.
`What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,&#39; said Robert Redford, weeping, `my life and my country were the greatest oddities of his life.&#39;
No one was afraid of making a fool of themselves or exaggerating.
As the &#39;Father&#39; of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and market collapse, when the crushed self-esteem of Americans is in a hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If there are few people to admire in this hard time without virtue, one doesn&#39;t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses as well as gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs, founded in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of an overdose, to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
It&#39;s all a gift to the country, which has struggled to assert itself against a deadly food culture.
A wave of astonishment swept over Hollywood, regardless of nationality or citizenship.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not just one person died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Academy Award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have lost the greatest of us all,&#39; confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who dares to try to live like Paul Newman lived: maintain high standards of integrity, lead a responsible private life, live far from the cameras.
That&#39;s not always easy or even possible in today&#39;s media jungle.
But there is someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?&#39; he often joked himself.
In heaven he&#39;ll be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinions as his fans, which isn&#39;t exactly common in America.
`Of all the great roles he played, none he was so proud of as faithful husband, loving father, thoughtful grandpa and philanthropist,&#39; they say.
The roads in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after failing for 2012, maybe it can be 2016.
But I ask myself: `Are we prepared for this?&#39;
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it&#39;s not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my judgment it was the worst road with all the trimmings there was.
Of course that&#39;s a lot of nonsense, given the rating and I could check, clearly something like that wouldn&#39;t have gone through.
But, let&#39;s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket fetch that allows you to go first.
It doesn&#39;t seem bad to me either, but if they&#39;re going to let you go ahead, then they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
So not after all.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists in going there just for that) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The t-shirt only came in size `S&#39; (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to only buy smaller, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, stuff like this is trivial compared to the days on the road.
Apart from having to go very early to get the chip, there is a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Eventually, as might be expected, the road began and we hadn&#39;t left our backpacks in front of it, even though once we had managed it, it would have been more difficult to get them back.
In addition, during the 40 minutes of waiting it looked like rain, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow surely some 500 people will have pneumonia and some like me won&#39;t even show up for classification on time because of this chip I got, I can imagine the exit was wrongly marked.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect street, I would never think of that street.
So I think we&#39;ll be dreaming of a city that&#39;s well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time to come
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference&#39;, hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an artificial intelligence being without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as a Order a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a route planner to get around the company campus). The system pays attention to what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this &#39;receptionist&#39; can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also sort those present into groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist&#39; notices a third person, but she understands that this person does not belong to the group who is interviewing her, nor is it a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that they will listen soon.

Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week there was very superficial talk about Microsoft&#39;s change in strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and won&#39;t have as many built-in programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the bare essentials instead of being filled with commercial junk, they would run five times faster. Man, Steven, that&#39;s only going to be for the few.
It&#39;s all just a statement considering Microsoft added one or the other feature and &#39;extras&#39; in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually becoming less important, as is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, part of the theory was that it was Google&#39;s first move to compete with Windows.
Many cleverly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law.
That&#39;s correct.
The system will never go away, but one must think of its &#39;death&#39; not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the `windows&#39; environment.
What is half of the applications in the computer used for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so over the top, less complicated.
Microsoft&#39;s interest is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality they need it, without a doubt. I bring a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the Microsoft employee recreation rooms earlier this month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink vending machine: `Your search. Our future&#39;. It prints out a request to use own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning of 2009 but rather at the end of 2009, more likely even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already out, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick&#39;s &#39;Blood Diamond&#39;, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &#39;The Godfather&#39;. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start counting the countless star appearances, we can fall back on the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had been lifting heavyweights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male cotton T-shirt, sleeveless and fitted.
English speakers call it `tank&#39;. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called `Marcel&#39; in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the origin of the name is linked to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
&#39;La Marcel&#39; towers above all for its excellent cotton, for its distinctive unisex cut and features a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) which these t-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only focus on the production of `tanks&#39;.
They also have college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cardigans and cashmeres, cotton trousers, striped t-shirts, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it&#39;s a pity to use them as underwear.
You are very attractive.
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this people carrier offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are the technical refinements that enable even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new Jazz shares a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new spatial flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
However, before starting to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new Jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, compared to other manufacturers, Honda managed to update this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and throughout 2008.
After the Jazz appeared on the market, around a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with around half a million cars sold in six years.
Despite this, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10,000 cars. That is 17% of the assumed growth on the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002. That is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the Spanish branch expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models a year.
In more detail, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the drop in sales in Spain.
In reality, the brand&#39;s leaders hope to close the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That&#39;s 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to last year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is betting on the appearance of a new model.
It&#39;s Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer&#39;s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight&#39;s market launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior space is also increased.
This success is due on the one hand to the new space flexibility program and on the other hand to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution also used on the previous Jazz model.
Also the capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading surface system, reaches up to 339 liters, that is 19 liters more than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, because the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, apart from additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, while the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque performance for the entire engine running time.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves an output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This petrol engine - the previous Jazz model achieves 78 hp - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In view of the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp 1.4 model consumes 5.4 liters of fuel and emits 128 grams of CO2.
`I want to be a young mother; I&#39;m not worried about the candidate&#39;
Her big appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite but full of joie de vivre.
The Gruz siblings are currently taking their new job in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, that means a lot more than it does for some pretty rich girls who keep their reputations.
She was in Paris for the promotion of the Mango company, moves to live there and also makes the presentation of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner in the short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards&#39; and attended the Valentinos dinner honored.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
Working for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new season 4 collection for Mango?
Both my sister and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s; we find a lot of ideas there.
I like walking through a city and observing women, how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, aren&#39;t you?
I think so, but eventually it all comes together and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was little, I&#39;ve had a passion for clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s to rummage through my aunt&#39;s closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and in rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is tied together, it&#39;s like that, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
You recently turned 30, didn&#39;t you fall into a crisis?
What.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty year old I feel good.
I find the woman is maturing, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I&#39;m not afraid because of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was little and it gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother, aren&#39;t you?
I&#39;ve known for a long time that I&#39;m going to be a mother because my body demands it and I also want to be a young mother; I don&#39;t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I&#39;m not worried.
I will convey great feelings of happiness to my child and educate it with a lot of love.
As for cinematography, you keep track of the works you participated in that were filmed last year.
That&#39;s exactly how it is and I really want them to be presented to the public.
As a woman who has just left the theater, I am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be right away.
I very much wish that `La última hora&#39; and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo&#39; will be performed for the first time.
Let&#39;s see how you like them
A few days ago you appeared on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
It&#39;s okay, don&#39;t say things like that.
It&#39;s not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I&#39;ve known for a while, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organization&#39;s &#39;Women for a Better World&#39; charity event and the clothes we&#39;re showing. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection were auctioned for Mango to raise money for Naomi&#39;s NGO.
People don&#39;t know Naomi&#39;s good heart.
Many things are said about them. I, as the one who knows them, would tell you that they are not true.
Nonetheless, I will support this good cause she is a part of.
She asked me to join the parade for this great cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do that too.
To support the women in the third world, which is also necessary.
`Auto Bee&#39; that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, this time Nissan took inspiration from nature, more precisely from bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&amp;D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of Nissan&#39;s four-layer security shield.
This robot aims to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped flight space, very similar to the Nissan Security Shield.
Most importantly, the bee&#39;s compound eyes can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, allowing it to fly uninterrupted in its personal airspace.
In order to reproduce the all-round perspective, the technicians developed what is known as the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two meters in front of the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a collision avoidance signal
`The moment when obstacle is detected, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels by 90º or more angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive maneuver is completely instinctive.
If it weren&#39;t, the robot might not be able to react with enough speed to avoid obstacles,&#39; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer on this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, but also not across corners; he can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways as the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to make the little robot avoid collisions.
`This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act on it.
It does not require storing neither information nor intuitive logic of the performed maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few tens of KB of disk space.
That sounds surprising, but it&#39;s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will bring to production cars in the next decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide driving to the destination avoiding the obstacles on the way.
Drivers who are prone to recidivism because of alcohol levels will need to install the `Alcolock&#39;.
The agency orders the driver, who has had three official penalties for drinking, to install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car while intoxicated. If he&#39;s drunk, the car won&#39;t start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Attorney General&#39;s Office report. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The purpose is to rehabilitate the driver, which is why he is given a course in driving behavior re-education.
In addition to the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also take part.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who have been reported more than once for drinking and driving get back behind the wheel.
The &#39;alcolock&#39; would prevent that because it&#39;s a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents auto-start if the driver has taken a breathalyzer; or if an alcohol concentration higher than permitted is detected.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by whoever imposes the sanction.
In this regard, a study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of violations in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, legal reform can be realized in the usual way, and yet reform of the Basic Law, which is necessary for the law enforcement process, is demanded.
The device is not yet available in stores in the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow of all days, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#39; Party, which proposes installing this system on school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes&#39;
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled by the program, the Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF Airport.
The sun was going down, but its rays still forced one to use one&#39;s hand as an umbrella to see the royal couple disembarking from the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very well, well, you can&#39;t pick people up at the airport at this time. She&#39;s from here or something
No, she&#39;s the Spanish one, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good
But the Mexican press knows full well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Navy soldiers delivering salutes of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long windblown hair, without the usual `peep-toes&#39;, she may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke is waiting for them.
She&#39;s trembling before she gets a mortgage on her.
One has to recognize that the US Treasury Department, besides having sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and to avoid US citizens getting caught up in mortgage stories from supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel&#39;, they say.
Or maybe, the &#39;hotel of bad credit&#39; or mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specifically its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it&#39;s the moment to ask for no credit.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the aim of the game.
Certainly she has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for the teens than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it&#39;s not about buying a better house
The best premium in fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards&#39; to promote and enhance young fashion talents internationally.
This will be awarded a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the window of the Mango store at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris yesterday and almost cried from the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company&#39;s second largest store in Europe and it was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m².
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened connected with it that we would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for chairing the jury of the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
Surrounded by many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart broken by the pain of his brother&#39;s recent death, pulls himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH which was stunning. Holding the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, he accompanied Valentino to the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up without jackets together with the Baron von Rotschild, because they lent jackets to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurrying to the shop, wore pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a ballet rehearsal hall, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of `grand plie&#39;.
Inés Sastre, did not join the tour of the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were delighted by the presence of Oliver Martínez, a character who always arouses stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance has to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that&#39;s life.
1001 advice against stress
There are not 1000, but one more possibility to forget the chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if they are few, they are all gathered in one book that tells how to relax. The book hits bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it goes off at 7am, but even worse is the thought of getting back into the frenetic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two methods to combat daily fatigue and the problems of how to disconnect from the world of work.
But the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga postures, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The anti-stress work is called &#39;1001 Ways to Relax&#39; and so the tranquility that the book conveys is making its way to bookstores from Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, methods are offered on how to stay in touch with nature or suggested 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline isn&#39;t pumping up your veins to restore balance to the body and stress has become a problem, it&#39;s time to sit on the sofa, turn off your brain and focus on reading.
talk in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I don&#39;t mean the ones who wake up telling us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
If it&#39;s happening to you for the first time, at best you&#39;ll be scared, but in reality it doesn&#39;t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talking.
It is quite common, especially among children and teenagers.
Certainly, more than one of you have been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during a high fever) or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child will not remember anything.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Connections with other phenomena during sleep are often sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), talking during sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or being overwhelmed.
In any case, this is a little-explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is highly variable.
It may be speaking quietly in single words, whispering, or it may be the complete opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In those cases when the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and comes about in this way.
We said it&#39;s a positive disorder, so it won&#39;t be treated unless it&#39;s related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is follow a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to agitate the child before bedtime.
So, choose quiet games for the kid and avoid stressful TV programs that are awful and a bit too wild.
For the nervous children for whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child sleep soundly.
If talking during sleep ever occurs, try to remain calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
don&#39;t wake it up
This is useless because the child is unconscious, so you will wake him up.
Although the child is talking, it is sleeping, so it is resting.
Remember, if after a couple of apparitions they are frightened, it is recommended that they seek counseling or find out why the child is frightened.
If they understand what they&#39;re saying (which is not so common), they don&#39;t pressure the child to conduct an interrogation and elicit more information.
You won&#39;t be able to do anything with it because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it is saying that, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it doesn&#39;t tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing serious, this is a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhauser... finally
After a long dry spell, Illhauser is finally back on the road to success on the pitch.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks created numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, wasn&#39;t very high.
After an initial attack by guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot just missed the top corner, Illhauser should easily dominate the game, and alternately first Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Brain with a high pass and Romain with a toe shot, managed to defend to challenge Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in midfield, only letting through the lively Riahi at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive, with two chances created by Riahi and Temporale, and then the first goal for Illhäuser by Marais, who was just in the right place to receive a ball that Diebold saved in an initial attempt had been.
But the Illhäusl goalscorer was not to enjoy his luck for long and was sent to the bench about 12 minutes later, leaving his team-mates outnumbered.
Denmark, however, failed to capitalize on this and did not pose much of a problem for an illusory eleven who only retreated a little to `pack up&#39; their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game when the ball came very close after a big mess the bar passed.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
Faced with the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the approaches to several Brittany and Normandy ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him &#39;with a constructive spirit&#39; and hope he will come up with &#39;concrete proposals&#39;.
The President&#39;s visit comes at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee set up by Breton fishermen to take action in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record average of over 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, &#39;the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to secure seafarers&#39; job conditions and pay&#39;.
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados that caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections with Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the seafarers showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d&#39;Olonnes, in Vendée, where the trawlers did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of merchant ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique broke the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to await the course of Wednesday&#39;s meeting at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
`The strike will continue&#39; because `the fishermen will not give up on anything&#39; and `do not want to go to Paris&#39;, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Commercial fishermen, who don&#39;t pay taxes on diesel, currently cost around 50 cents a liter, but they believe that the breakeven point for a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents a liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable &#39;Butch Cassidy and the Kid&#39; actor died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83 of complications from cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer meets its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the looming recession as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world&#39;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially for its 30- to 120-seat aircraft.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to Sunday&#39;s Financial Times, insurer American International Group, which received financial backing from the US Monetary Authority, is considering selling more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was advanced.
AIG is poised to pursue the sale of a majority of its businesses, in addition to its international life insurance and US retirement plans.
According to the FT, AIG&#39;s board of directors met Sunday night to review potential sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG may divest include its aircraft leasing arm International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments, the FT said.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales as soon as possible in order to repay the 85 billion loans granted by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk of the American authorities retaining 80% of their capital and the current shareholders losing the same proportion.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices on Monday, with the Dow Jones down 6.98%, an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson&#39;s plan to bail out the banks 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is down 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the fall in trade following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final hit figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&amp;Poor&#39;s 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Wall Street, already struggling earlier in the quarter, collapsed after the Chamber of Deputies unexpectedly rejected the plan to bail out the banks, which was supposed to bring some stability back to the markets.
By a vote of 228 against and 205 in favor, the House of Representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans opposed his plan.
`This is a bad image being circulated that portrays Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,&#39; said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,&#39; she added, fearing that a project accepted in several days will be `too late&#39;.
`If the project is doomed to fail (...) it will quickly be up to the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which will affect credit conditions more,&#39; warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, further emphasizing the sense of extreme urgency, &#39;that every day that passes &#39;brings about the ruin of a financial enterprise&#39; in the United States.
Following Washington Mutual&#39;s bankruptcy on Friday, US authorities planned to have Wachovia&#39;s banking operations bought by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favor of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets were facing &#39;not just an American crisis, but a global one&#39;, he added the analyst at FTN Financial added.
The market for basic necessities has grown rapidly.
Treasury receipts in 10 years fell from 3.632% to 3.827% Friday night, and receipts in 30 years from 4.161% to 4.357% last night.
Morgan Stanley is providing its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to issue $9 billion, taking over 21% of its capital, an innovation that predicts a sharp fall in its stock market price is due.
A week after a preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks announced that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a flat price of $25.25 for a total consideration of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share price on August 31st.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion to purchase convertible stock, which will earn it a 10% profit and can be sold at $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global deal will be done based on a single average price of $29, which is 28% above the current market value.
However, Morgan Stanley shares are down 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
`This strategic association represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley&#39;s transition to holding bank status,&#39; said John Mack, CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley assumed that status last week, which should allow it to expand its operations into new areas, but under Federal Reserve oversight.
Her association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street&#39;s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the past few days: last Monday Morgan simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for around $8.5 billion.
`A week ago,&#39; explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo, `we thought the holding would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce risk and protect ourselves. &#39;
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will go ahead with a cut in earnings of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred stock to common stock within a year if the latter is exchanged within a given timeframe at more than 50% above market value, or approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more details on the strategic intentions of the two new allies.
After MUFG&#39;s investment, Morgan Stanley should have a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it has &#39;significantly&#39; reduced its balance sheet since late August.
The past few weeks have been tough for the group, who have seen their stock price fall by half while the price of their default insurance soared.
This price declined on Monday but remained at high levels, around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other &#39;survivor&#39; of Wall Street&#39;s big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett&#39;s group , to have picked up.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refounding the Republic around 21st Century Socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third party who, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, put the plan for a new constitution up for election this Sunday.
Mission accomplished as according to the public results totaling 80% of the voters vote 64% voted `yes&#39; in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted `No&#39;, 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were cast blank.
In order for the constitutional project to be passed, one vote must be obtained more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two exit polls and an NGO census announced a clear victory for &#39;Yes&#39;, prophesying 63% to 70%.
Incidentally, during the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
In Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, he assured the `Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly&#39; and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held quietly under the Organization of American States (OAS) observation delegation, referred to a 444-point text aimed at safeguarding the &#39;new socialism&#39; championed by the President.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy, giving it the exclusive right to &#39;plan development&#39; in a country that lives largely on oil production by foreign companies and on the foreign currency that emigrants send into the country.
The project, promoted by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants greater powers to the head of state, who will be able to hold up to two consecutive four-year mandates and the possibility of dissolving the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also secures the principle of free health care and free education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Eventually, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the Quito-Washington agreement to use an Equatorian base as a launch pad for American counternarcotics operations.
Obama, winner on points in the first television duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to see who emerged victorious, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs for both the Republican and Democratic elections announced their own victory in this televised duel that was to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain&#39;s performance, while respectable, was not &#39;brilliant&#39; enough to enable him to halt his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday that put Obama five points ahead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), thinks the Democrat clearly outperforms.
Among undecided voters, those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner with 39% of the polls, while 25% of them see McCain as the winner, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the fine performance expected of fellow competitor Joseph Biden in his first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She&#39;s got good instincts,&#39; warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain never stopped emphasizing his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while clearly emphasizing his opponent&#39;s &#39;naivety&#39; on the issues at the heart of that first televised duel.
`Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that...&#39; he pointed out several times.
`I don&#39;t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,&#39; he added.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being disconcerted.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions and renew the world&#39;s image of the United States.
&#39;McCain still doesn&#39;t get it, but Obama does,&#39; countered a Democratic campaign commercial this weekend, which accused Republicans of not grasping the full extent of the crisis weighing on the &#39;American off the street.&#39;
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me but nothing about you,&#39; Obama told 20,000 people gathered in the pouring rain at a campaign rally in North Carolina yesterday.
He didn&#39;t even mention the words &#39;middle class&#39; or &#39;worker&#39;. &#39; The financial crisis gives a clear advantage to Obama, whom Americans believe is best placed to bail out the economy even when it is on the brink of collapse.
`The coming week could be a crucial turning point,&#39; estimated influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama&#39;s &#39;good economic instincts&#39; to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is `the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies implemented by George Bush and endorsed by Senator McCain.&#39;
After reiterating that he might even cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street vacillations, the Illinois senator pointed out that establishing the country&#39;s eventual energy independence and the Promoting renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, are top priorities for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant consisting of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully dodged questions related to the $700 billion financial market bailout plan that passed last night&#39;s Congress and is extremely unpopular with the public.
`Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?&#39;
Young people and members of the opposition demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered in Minsk&#39;s market square on Sunday evening since polling stations closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced yet, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: `The dictator should resign&#39;.
Some admit that they didn&#39;t vote in the first place: `What&#39;s the point if they can do whatever they want with my vote anyway,&#39; says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has presented itself in the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including visa bans for 40 leading Belarusian figures and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections are deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
`We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting,` lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous coalition of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and in our case that is the executive.
When opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they were appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean TV airtime, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. &#39;
The opposition therefore owes it to itself to get involved in the political game, because `the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis and we don&#39;t reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent&#39;.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that the turnout figures seem too high and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Did you notice that there was an election?&#39; asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, and those who are closest to what the government wants. &#39;
The stillness of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the central election commission congratulate each other on their success.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held captive in the desert for 11 days, were returned safe and sound to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at al-Maza military base next to Cairo International Airport at around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
Without being able to speak to the press, they were taken directly on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, an expatriate area of Cairo, to be examined there.
They are all &#39;very healthy&#39; and the kidnappers &#39;no ransom was paid&#39;, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
After being captured on September 19 during an off-road vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages were repeatedly moved from hiding place to hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, which organizes the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, from two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
`Guns were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,&#39; said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 Egyptian special forces members had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is at the moment, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
`We must acknowledge that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces men,&#39; he said without further ado.
He also denied that any ransom had been paid.
The previous evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped an all-terrain vehicle on patrol containing the hijackers, killing six of them, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army said they were linked to a Darfour rebel group, the Liberation du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate about the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological digs, or the national historic sites that are starving miserably?
Which politician would dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That Quebec, like Canada, doesn&#39;t have proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors write in their country&#39;s constitution that protecting cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that cultural heritage must be protected by every citizen, every legislature, and every county, by mutual consent.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 Historical Societies, strive to delve deeply into history, save a few pennies to save the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the force of desperation when promoters and decision makers unleash their bulldozers on our ancient stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and heritage?
Parley - Of the blood made sure again
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Most importantly, she has regained public confidence, which had been badly shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
The national blood pools managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donation Service are known to have been contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994 the Government of Canada, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched a public inquiry aimed at shedding light on the circumstances leading up to such a tragedy and formulating policy to prevent another catastrophe of this kind.
At the time, while Judge Krever was reluctant to deliver his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Committee Gélineau fulfilled this mandate.
According to Gélineau and Krever&#39;s reports, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, serving Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to service the other provinces and the two territories.
`In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, barely 38% of the people had confidence in the blood bank system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Decary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the tremendous effort to improve blood safety and work in this area over the following years, we have regained the public&#39;s trust,&#39; she says, before proudly pointing out that as of early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec&#39;s population is now had faith in Hema-Quebec.
dr However, Décary keeps in mind that &#39;trust is something extremely fragile&#39;.
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has operated on a prudent basis.
At that time we were witnessing the emergence in Europe of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been at the helm since its inception in 1998.
`And we didn&#39;t have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we invoked one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that when you don&#39;t know and when a disease is progressing slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, you use exclusionary measures manifested by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 blood was not accepted from anyone who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, several years ago it was proved beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event showed us that the principle of prudence that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor&#39;s blood, and not that of antibodies to the virus, as is the case with was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period that occurs between the moment the person is infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This time was reduced to less than a week.
This significantly reduced the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and not being able to detect it.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, it would take 12 million units of blood to be distributed before anyone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 units of blood each year, it would be more than 24 years before a case of HIV being transmitted via a unit of blood would occur.
I believe that nowadays one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health,&#39; said the Hema-Quebec executive director.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogens may enter the system.
The Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects via the blood, appeared on the island of Réunion only last year.
We have to monitor continuously,&#39; continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to secure supplies, Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies.
`Demand is increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer-fighting treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population is also affecting the blood donor network, which comprises on average only 3% of Quebecers who are eligible to donate blood. &#39;
Any healthy person aged 18 or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who donate blood are rejected because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is endemic are banned from donating blood for a year.
`With this 3% we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It&#39;s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it&#39;s rare to find time to spend an hour donating blood&#39;, Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec&#39;s only public cord blood bank.
Once considered biomedical waste, the umbilical cord contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our 1,000th cord blood sample and we plan to collect more than 1,000 a year.
`We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,&#39; said Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it&#39; because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal&#39;s Impact advanced to the semi-finals of the playoffs yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 with all goals) win over Seattle&#39;s Sounders in the second and decider game of the Quarterfinals series at Saputo Stadium, where goals counted overall qualified in the first division of the USL.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the winning goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without a goal for either side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for Montreal&#39;s formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one standing in Matt Jordan&#39;s way for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the weekend series on Friday, Impact gave the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburbs, a 2-1 loss.
In the semifinals, Impact will go head-to-head with Vancouver&#39;s Whitecaps.
In Saturday night&#39;s second leg in Minnesota, Thunder rebounded from a 3-1 deficit with a 4-3 win, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 aggregate goal difference.
Impact will likely face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be finalized today.
In short - winning goal by Kovalev
Canada&#39;s No. 1 trio are ready to tackle the season.
Last night the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove the attack on the Florida Panthers with a barrage resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec provided two assists and Kovalev converted a pass in the win, the Tricolore&#39;s fourth in six preseason games.
Kovalev achieved the win by scoring the only goal of the whole shootout.
`I&#39;m not ready yet,&#39; the Russian warned.
I need one more game to feel good. &#39;
`He got too fixated on that in the first half, Guy Carbonneau remarked.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received thunderous applause. &#39;
Charest bets on the north
The prime minister does not rule out holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal party&#39;s general assembly ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is attempting to be elected in today&#39;s by-election.
`Moving the course of our last great northern frontier&#39;: this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented visually at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis yesterday, following the guidelines entirely.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
Spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, Quebec viewed on `Google Maps&#39;, maps, etc. rotated on three huge screens.
Large funds as during the election period.
In fact, the prime minister refused to rule out the possibility of holding the elections this autumn when speaking to the press, despite saying that his schedule was very busy.
The &#39;Plan Nord&#39; is the fourth element of a &#39;vision&#39; the Prime Minister is said to have for Quebec, of a &#39;new economic area&#39; that includes a labor agreement with France, an accord between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister&#39;s speeches of late, the opening up of the North - the northern region at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North is &#39;a jewel with enormous potential&#39;, but gave no date, investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, a few glimpses of what could be done more: first of all on hydropower, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favored by the growth of the emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest&#39;s enumeration, the North possesses &#39;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds&#39;.
This `territory twice the size of France&#39; `is near us, is in Quebec.
It&#39;s not just near us, it&#39;s within us&#39;, he emphasized, as if to clearly show that he is trying to realize a national founder&#39;s dream.
Quebec has grown a lot through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James&#39; Bay.
`It&#39;s ours, it&#39;s our future,&#39; he added after pausing theatrically to view the giant map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec&#39;s territory, includes part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister told the press.
`This is a traditional stance that all governments have taken.
There is a borderline where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises I will take this stance again on behalf of the government,&#39; he stated.
Also, `With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,&#39; he explained, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable year-round due to ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical backdrop, the prime minister says it is almost a duty to occupy this territory.
And the inhabitants of the area, the aborigines and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist deputy from Ungava) have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) has a prominent place, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large gathering, &#39;not necessarily a summit&#39; but an opportunity where &#39;a common vision will be created&#39;.
Moreover, the development of the North will proceed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the Plan Nord will be &#39;discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,&#39; he promised.
Jean Charest described this &#39;vision&#39; as if it were a continuation of that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
`Like the Liberals who came before us, we have re-thinked to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
Incidentally, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a huge cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage&#39;s assumption of leadership of the party.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power station the Adélard Godbout dam.
`From Godbout creating Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage achieving the silent revolution and nationalizing water electricity, to Bourassa making James Bay, our party has always known how to define the future,&#39; explained Jean Charest.
To the press he referred to another project, this time conservative, namely the &#39;Roads to the North&#39; program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Referring to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest emphasizes that it is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012.
&#39;It&#39;s between us, but I intend to be there,&#39; he confided to his party members, to a storm of applause from those.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which he is legally able to do.
However, he stresses that his schedule is busy, mainly because of a Community Council mission to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend&#39;s General Assembly provided the Liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, most notably &#39;constitutional targets&#39;, which were readily adopted: the PLQ specifically calls for recognition of &#39;Quebec&#39;s distinctiveness&#39; in the constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and have them veto the decisions made in Quebec.
The guidelines of the Plan Nord were met with skepticism by the opposition.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has revived the policy for the development of North-du-Quebec that the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refrained from using them.
If she had, &#39;we would be much further along today&#39;, judged Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the government&#39;s adoption of a Plan Nord.
`But what we want is that this is not just a big show,&#39; said party leader Sébastien Proulx, standing in for Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr Vic Toews, ex-&#39;Justice&#39; Secretary (how ironic) in the Harper Cabinet, who took the liberty to say of Louise Arbor last summer that she was a &#39;disgrace&#39; to Canada.
This woman, who has fought a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration for being so disgraced, says as much about those around the Prime Minister as it does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that was the only one from all the countries concerned that did not bring home its compatriot who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn&#39;t even take into account that Omar Khadr was just a teenager when the things he&#39;s accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, has broken its word and allowed a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who deigns to parody justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are the main advocates for bringing Omar Khadr home for a fair trial in Canada.
This very government also turns a blind eye to torture: they care little that a young adult after so many years of torment will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of it, but we are witnessing an insidious curtailment of our rights, our liberties and our &#39;democracy&#39;, that word which Harper constantly carries before him like a flag and which comes out of his mouth sounding so meaningless.
So, the time has come when there is no more morality: you can ill-treat, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen at will at the whim of a leader who to this day has only the support of a minority (may he vote after October 14th). belong to the minority...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they don&#39;t see that this government has renounced what made our country&#39;s reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this defection, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President of Canada&#39;s Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms, following Orwellian logic, that the world&#39;s largest gold mining company was seeking a $6 million libel suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the aim of opening a &#39;public transparent debate&#39;.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel suits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to bankrupt anyone who dares to express an opinion contrary to theirs.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of Book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money preparing their defense and fighting with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the gold mine&#39;s almost endless pockets .
Incidentally, the tactic in these unequal battles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement that will silence the other side and also deter anyone who dares to revisit the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they should have put their point of view before public opinion.
Contrary to what is common practice in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are typically settled through the exchange of ideas rather than the thrashing of clubs.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent investigation teams, which could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold appears to have no faith in public opinion, and waved aside the petitions and letters in support of Noir Canada&#39;s authors.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can simultaneously ask for a &#39;public&#39; debate and yet disregard the opinions of that very public?
Apparently, in the Vice President&#39;s world, that word only encompasses the generously paid attorneys, and not the community of all Canadians; quite a narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn&#39;t understand—or doesn&#39;t want to understand—is that the public that supports the writers and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because they resent the gold mine&#39;s brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within what many perceive as a gag action (in the course of &#39;public debate&#39;, Barrick Gold has a claim on directed the authors of Noir Canada, demanding that they stop using the term...).
Aside from Mr. Garver&#39;s surreal speech, Barrick Gold&#39;s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic inquiry and truth-telling that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It totally denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it&#39;s impossible in a country like Canada to research and discuss issues that don&#39;t please the world&#39;s wealthy corporations, who else can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could have it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit these types of unjustified claims.
Bailout for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to stop the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two chambers of Congress.
The main points are: better control by MPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money invested, new injunctions to limit the number of houses forfeited for arrears and the right to pay wages monitor paid to senior executives of supported companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Senator Judd Gregg, present at the hearing, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
`We have made great strides toward an agreement that will be marketable,&#39; said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
&quot;Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street crisis,&quot; the Democrat said.
`This is the fundamental point: If we don&#39;t do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,&#39; said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours amid fears of the effect another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline that had been agreed upon was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who entered the negotiations late, presented themselves as more in favor of the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction at having to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the settlement, primarily those allowing homeowners to keep their homes and those affecting the salaries of executives at companies bailed out by the state.
`If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,&#39; he declared on American television channels.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, `I&#39;d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The Guiding Principles that I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,&#39; he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards using taxpayer money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage lending (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more common borrowing (PCAA), and finally to a financial freeze and the ruin of the banks and financial institutes.
It was a group of Republican MPs who thwarted the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain &#39;toxic&#39; assets of distressed companies should only be secured by the government and not bought, the impasse is believed to have been broken.
To round out perspectives for everyone in Congress, it also added an executive order stating that if the government made a loss on this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to recoup capital.
The new plan envisages paying an initial sum of 250 billion, to which can be added another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be passed in a new vote by Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which it earns dividends on profits and which it can resell when the storm has passed.
The federal government will have the ability to halt foreclosure proceedings on the homes attached to the home loans affected by this plan, as well as set deadlines for repayment and severance pay to executives of affected companies.
The plan&#39;s developers would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it&#39;s not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more voices were raised yesterday against this plan, from both Republicans and Democrats.
`Clearly Washington doesn&#39;t understand us,&#39; Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Treasury Committee, told constituents.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of asking taxpayers to pay&#39;.
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress dubbed &#39;the Caucasus of Skeptics&#39;, takes a different view but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to say: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider which path to take,&#39; he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we got proof again that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which has been in deep trouble since it raised 2 billion euros (US 2.9 billion). -dollar) lost in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is among the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
&#39;This is not lost money,&#39; declared Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are on the horizon. &#39;
During this time, across the Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank troubled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from property loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank&#39;s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the UK government has had to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump card for a long time, nobody would say his weakness.
Had the American actor with the charming smile freed himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His delicacy, sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrifying monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 of complications from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in its golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on screen for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as much an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian descent.
From its European roots would emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, utmost quality.
Because it reflected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in combat in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then the Actor&#39;s Studio in New York before finding success in theatre, television and soon cinema.
This same civil rights campaigner was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Mans and was also a sex symbol, although he had been in a star relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this star, mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive to the glamor of show business, whose mysteries will never be completely solved, will disappear.
A decent man, in the truest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sent movie lovers into a frenzy this weekend as all his major roles played out on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of ever-changing American film art is passing by with him.
That brings to mind the charming cowboy from &#39;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#39; (1969), and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958 became.
A much more recent memory is evoked (1990) of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not keep all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, boisterous, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Robert Wise&#39;s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death and which really made Newman famous in 1956 .
This likeable crook in the 1973 Oscar-winning best-picture The Sting.
As the bitter and vengeful pool player in Robert Rossen&#39;s wonderful The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that&#39;s what he was.
Still him.
Epochs come together in his CV.
Young people know him above all from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the less than orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in the Coen brothers&#39; The Hudsucker Proxy in 1994.
He came full circle with a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes&#39; Road to Perdition.
Unlike several cinema legends who retired soon enough, Newman was to stay in the saddle long, betraying Hollywood, its fortune, its pageantry and its concessions in the process.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to &#39;underplaying&#39; as he judged his overly expressive performances.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time just flew the roles.
However, he rarely played sunny boys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, bullies or desperate people, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slipping and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true delicate sensibilities.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (based on the Canadian Margaret Laurence&#39;s novel) starring his wife Joanne Woodward, painted a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of tributes that spilled over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had acted together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), deeply moved, declared: `His presence has shaped my life and this land improved.&#39;
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential qualities of the late actor.
Alongside his legendary career, there is also a great advocate of civil rights, environmentalism and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood drift.
We must have often seen him with his foot in bowls of vinaigrette, sauces, pastries, or other foods and thought it was pretty distasteful, although we thought it was funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and to the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was an honor to be here. &#39;
And it was an honor for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A model citizen, in the narrowest and the broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8th, negotiations begin in the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The accused are accused in particular of participation in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including document forgery.
According to the public prosecutor, the funds raised from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with forged invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender funds were obtained, and the clubs are said to have failed to fulfill their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices are said to have been forged.
The blocks of accounts were bought at the Józsefváros market, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices to was made on the round trip north of Lake Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
In the course of this &quot;exploration tour&quot; Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded bills for consumption so that he could later issue bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor and the Budapest self-government based on these templates.
Most of these accounts are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, with the latter, according to our information, being responsible for drafting the relevant reports.
One of the destinations of Lados&#39; &quot;discovery tour&quot; was a beer pub.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering business is said to have catered to the group of ninety from the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
But now the head of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant all at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at a time, 130 guests are said to have stayed, according to the bill.
Apparently, there were no limits to the imagination of the invoice forgers when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering business whose accounting records for customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, when he was presented with documents by the public prosecutor&#39;s office during an interrogation, he immediately realized that the documents were forged.
&quot;Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp.&quot;
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the establishment is said to have accommodated one hundred people, after they have a total of eleven rooms that cannot possibly accommodate that many people, was also wrong.
Meals were also stated on the bill, although the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The industrious bill forgers also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offers trips abroad, so they included Hungary trips on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company&#39;s accounting practice.
As became known in the course of the investigation, they also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25 percent. In addition, the employees only issue machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten .
Another mistake the &quot;accountants&quot; made was that in one case they stated &quot;transport of goods&quot; as the service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor said.
Further formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - was to be owed that to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers claimed that they never issued the invoices.
Another &quot;mistake&quot; was made by the forgers at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in the process of being dissolved at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group is said to have eaten there - the liquidator consequently stated that not having issued the invoices themselves.
Deliberately fake
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to create fictitious accounts.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to around HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is said to have worked with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation and the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with forged invoices totaling HUF 5 million that related to services not rendered.
However, there was also little payment transactions, since the invoices were canceled immediately after they were issued, which those affected forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes people who are directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman for the Ukrainian director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company that cannot be found there.
In the period from October to December 2005, this company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of around HUF 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005, is said to have acted as the purchaser of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be sent by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation, invoices in the name of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected the equivalent value themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at Iván Kubatov&#39;s express wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies was active, which according to the defendant was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company formation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlasz and Y - Generacio.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices to the organizations with a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The public prosecutor&#39;s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were enclosed with Biztos Pont&#39;s applications.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (&quot;TMA&quot;) in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for other purposes.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
Incidentally, these invoices were seized during a search of Árpád Kemecsei&#39;s office in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some of the defendants are now expecting a confession about how the invoices were falsified, as was already filed before the public prosecutor&#39;s office.
There could be a sensation if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he has already repeatedly promised to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
So the question remains whether it is in his interest to do so, whether the socialists have made a pact with him to compensate for most of the HUF 50 million damage caused, and whether Zuschlag is willing to take responsibility in return.
But it&#39;s entirely possible that Zuschlag is now playing the &quot;offended&quot; man after his pleas for reduced incarceration and house arrest fell on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid for them are at large, or at least under house arrest, Zuschlag is denied this opportunity.
The psychology of overbidding - or why we are willing to pay more
At auction, buyers tend to spend more and overvalue what&#39;s on offer.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in &quot;Science&quot; magazine, people do not want to be defeated in a competition such as an auction on eBay and are therefore willing to even pay excessive prices.
Researchers tried to explore the neurological scheme of this &quot;game&quot; using experimental auctions.
One group of the volunteers was asked to play the lottery while the other took part in a playful activity - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants could win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which overbidding the opponent plays an important role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the &quot;self-reward&quot; of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore suggested that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group also carried out investigations into the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward if they emerged victorious from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in case of a lost game.
The only difference between the two groups was that one emphasized winning while the other emphasized losing.
In support of the neurologists&#39; hypothesis, however, members of the &quot;against-losing&quot; group were willing to bet higher than those in the control and &quot;win&quot; groups, respectively.
&quot;These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
So far, they have only justified the behavior observed at auctions with the joy of winning or the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to neuroimaging techniques, so we now have a third explanation ready&quot; - said Andrew Schotter, professor at the School of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, but the causative agents and the diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses are spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D the viruses can be spread through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretions or saliva).
In any case, travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B; there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and eyes, the stools become light-colored, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Around the world, around 1 million people die every year from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person is on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, since the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is therefore essential.
There are three groups in which this condition is more common: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and those with tattoos.
The number of people suffering from chronic hepatitis C worldwide is currently estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected in a routine laboratory test, it is advisable to consult your family doctor at the first sign of unknown origin.
If recognized in time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, which eliminates the risk of infection and prevents the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by patient advocacy groups worldwide.
The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, how it develops and the importance of early detection.
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has experienced turbulence as a result of the US financial crisis: the three countries are providing the banking and insurance institute, which incidentally also has branches in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11, 2 billion available.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands met at the highest level over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro zone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions now being taken in relation to the bank could have precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states are buying about 49 percent of the bank&#39;s respective shares.
The bank is likely to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance operations it bought from Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares began a steep descent last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big to go bankrupt.
The institution&#39;s securities fell 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which management says is unrealistic.
Management believes that the USD 700 billion US bailout and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the slide in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank&#39;s new general manager on Friday.
The bank was also looking for a private buyer, but could not find anyone with a factual offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, no panic has broken out among customers, and the bank&#39;s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Do believers feel less pain?
The latest research shows that religious belief acts like a kind of &quot;painkiller&quot; that is said to have made the deaths of Catholic martyrs easier.
Scientists from Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: They examined the extent to which belief in God affects people&#39;s perception of pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and 12 atheists were given electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Brain scan technology has even shown that Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The investigation was the first in a research project involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
In the experiment, a sparkling device was tied to the left hand of the test subjects, which delivered the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one, an image of the Mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other, Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s Lady with an Ermine.
Researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would induce a kind of religious trance among believers while they chose da Vinci&#39;s painting because it was little different from the other painting and was found to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages while they were asked to look at either the religious painting or the other painting.
Catholics reported feeling &quot;safe,&quot; as if &quot;cared for,&quot; and &quot;calm and peace&quot; at the sight of the Mother of God.
They reported 12% less pain while viewing the religious painting than when viewing Leonardo&#39;s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be evoked with other, powerful images on atheists, one just had to find the appropriate photo.
&quot;We would have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,&quot; says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research findings.
&quot;Practicing the faith should, and in many cases does, transform our personality,&quot; Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question that remains is what effect a painting of the Madonna by Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the believers&#39; pain regulation.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim: it can be found in people&#39;s pockets as well as in the sky above their heads: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what they do emotional.
And that&#39;s not all, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google&#39;s CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he says: They would overlook the very essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google&#39;s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus come closer to the company&#39;s original goal of &quot;organizing all the information in the world&quot;.
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of collecting information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google could answer questions like &quot;What should I do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;Which job really suits me?&quot; to answer, however, software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet research, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the &quot;Personalized Search&quot; introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and access it later, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called &quot;Recommendations&quot; are based on the same logic, with which the system recommends tailored products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of data abuse - &quot;If you look up what I&#39;m doing&quot; - some are concerned about Google&#39;s data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is frightening, rather than the guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom, or the rebellion against power that many Internet users experience encounters rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties if necessary, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent crackdown on pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called &quot;Orkut&quot;, which also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights could still breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully took the FBI to court: according to this, Google cannot be forced by any point of the constitution to give information to the FBI on secret request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, however, the list of individual users, or their web and search term lists, was withheld from them for two months retrospectively.)
Google&#39;s image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to give out their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google&#39;s services castigate the company with the indignation that befits conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American &quot;geek culture&quot;, which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees them as the next generation of &quot;cool entrepreneurs&quot;, in contrast to Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, albeit both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask for identification codes from its users and makes its services available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official ones practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks have a razor-sharp insight into the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the fore in particular in recent years thanks to the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot;.
&quot;Web 2.0&quot; is about nothing other than collaboration, that is, the users intentionally leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the extent is individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show oneself publicly.
The average teenager can manage their profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them together using other services such as Twitter or music services like last.fm, and finally can all of this be integrated into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip. embed fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries geo-hosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: Looking at the party photos of the previous night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her cheating boyfriend has had fun, or the employee is fired because he vented his anger at the company management all too honestly in his blog power - one thing is for sure: the term &quot;privacy&quot; has meanwhile been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who lives online is what they reveal about themselves - this is how you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today&#39;s youth.
And if you&#39;re trying to keep something secret or even circumvent the Google monopoly, you&#39;re welcome to do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google&#39;s search engine but intentionally leaves no traces.
Quite a few people deliberately avoid registering on community sites so they cannot be found, but Google&#39;s online applications, such as word processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile of the user.
Meanwhile, public opinion is waiting spellbound for Google to show its true colors.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of the Advertising agencies, and the accelerating rate of adoption of services, are a headache not only for Microsoft but for other software developers as well.
Critical observers, however, also find the opposite poles worrying: For example, the company management completely dismissed a protest by the employees after the fees for the company&#39;s own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also thought that feeding the employees several times was too expensive. But all of this seems almost mild compared to the fact that Google even bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement according to which all hits critical of the regime or those that went against good taste would be filtered out.
The group&#39;s internal policy is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn things upside down: While some believe that Google&#39;s book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking on such proportions that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more likely because of the Systems &quot;Health&quot;, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the material for the next generation of sci-fi authors - such as &quot;Scroogled&quot;, the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which, thanks to Google related data becomes frighteningly approachable.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd to remove the clues
In connection with the Ózd double murder, the police have now interrogated two youths who are suspected of helping to remove the evidence, the spokesman for the Borsod police station said on Tuesday.
The young people confessed, they are currently being accused of aiding and abetting.
According to information from the MTI news agency, the two girls are defending themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect in the Ózd double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The man is strongly suspected of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a compound in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the crime well in advance - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange launches bid for Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of blocks of shares from the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper &quot;E15&quot;, the offer by the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among all those interested, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders&#39; agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four Sarl with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments devoted to the ever-worsening international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday spoke of &quot;second September 11th&quot;.
We have the American president to thank for the global financial catastrophe, according to &quot;La Repubblica&quot; - the president was not even able to get his own party behind him for the bill that was supposed to bring some relief to the frightening situation. .
Rather than a &quot;new Pearl Harbor,&quot; as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a &quot;second September 11.&quot;
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to &quot;El Mundo&quot;, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush&#39;s plan wasn&#39;t perfect, but now that Congress has voted, there is a risk that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management at hand.
The world economy is hanging in the air just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, writes the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states could still provide rescue packages to their faltering financial institutions and use taxpayers&#39; money to save the banks from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, neither further cash injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU member states would have to step over their shadow and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to ailing financial institutions, the Viennese &quot;Der Standard&quot; recalls. In addition, the newspaper continues, concerns are becoming more and more realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers will now have to dig a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is now sweeping the old continents like a tsunami.
While the &quot;rescuers&quot; would not have to &quot;waggle&quot; hundreds of billions of euros immediately, it would be wise to note when it would be prudent to touch taxpayers&#39; money to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example that of the bees.
An amazing project was unveiled at CEATEC in Japan, in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees to create new crash-avoidance systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C auto-robot-controlled biomimetic system, a mini-car endowed with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids all collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval &quot;private space,&quot; which is very similar to our own &quot;shield,&quot; said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the show.
The bee&#39;s compound eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-guided distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180 degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the onboard microprocessor which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of bees, by rotating the tires by the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
&quot;If it weren&#39;t so, the auto-robot wouldn&#39;t be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,&quot; said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the &quot;Mobility Laboratory&quot; and the auto-robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when avoiding other bees.
And it has to happen in a split second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the evasion cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the turning ability of the tires.
While the bees have an infinite number of options here to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotary motion, or acceleration and deceleration, of the autorobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore last longer than traditional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that instinctive, intelligent reaction is what matters, and less the processing of the data and even less the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react to them accordingly.
It doesn&#39;t need to store these, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so it only uses a handful of KB of memory at a given time.
It does not require gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan expects to be in mass production within the next ten years.
The technology could also be used in GPS satellite navigation, by deliberately guiding drivers around obstacles and thus guiding them to their destination.
A name for the outrageously expensive child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bailout law, which will be implemented in several stages and aims to buy the banks&#39; bad loans, is available.
Half of the money should be spent in the first round.
In a session that ended after midnight EST on Saturday, Congressmen reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
&quot;We have made significant progress,&quot; said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, and said that the agreement only had to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the bailout package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: The program will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the tide of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the Asian markets opened, ie 8 am Washington time Sunday evening (2 am Monday Central European Time), but it did not trigger a surge in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 Economic Stabilization Bill, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration&#39;s original recommendation that the $700 billion be spent all at once on buying bad debt-encumbered securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion being available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be used to purchase bad debt securities, and the President is to decide on the remaining USD 100 billion.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is pending another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can also use a combination of tactics: it can simultaneously purchase bad credit, mortgages, mortgaged securities, or other &quot;toxic&quot; loans.
As reported by the responsible persons of the ministry, the purchase can take place either in an auction or directly.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury Department guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay fees based on the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid for the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk, triggered by the collapse of a major financial institution.
&quot;We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law once it is signed,&quot; Paulson said.
However, the bosses of the banks that have gotten into trouble and are now dependent on state aid can count on the fact that their severance payments, which are casually called the &quot;golden handshake&quot; in overseas slang, will be cut by the government.
Salary cuts will only happen in certain cases, and those cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out.
The cut essentially means that if the department buys at auction, the &quot;golden handshake&quot; will be taxed unless the veteran bank chief is pushed into retirement.
In the event of an outright purchase of the bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure executive salaries are not overstated.
Also part of the picture is that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements so that more people can participate in the program.
Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Treasury Committee, commented on the measure for the first time in American history that executive pay cuts will be enacted by law.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, which reduces the risk for taxpayers, since they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank are doing better again.
The bill would require the President to submit a proposal to Congress within the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there have been skeptics on both sides who have expressed their doubts about the plan.
That&#39;s not what American citizens expect of us, and the plan does nothing to protect taxpayers&#39; money, said California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague Mary Kaptur said: The measures were driven by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the American-Hungarian visa agreement will come into force around January 12, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, &quot;everything now only depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in good time.&quot;
But she also stressed that in the new system there will be no entry permit, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will hold talks in Washington from today.
She will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom she will present the Republic of Hungary&#39;s Intermediate Cross of Merit with Star, and she will also hold talks with Democrat Barack Obama&#39;s foreign policy advisers and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates from the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bank bailout on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials announced on Sunday morning after days of marathon deliberations that they had reached agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the thawing of the frozen credit market became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama has continued to extend his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain&#39;s high, which he got from Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin&#39;s presentation after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those consumer protection passages that he helped support.
&quot;We have to act now, and responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire branches of industry, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened,&quot; he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain&#39;s economic vision &quot;obsolete.&quot;
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said, &quot;We&#39;re all going to have a hard time pining on that (...) but doing nothing is definitely not an option.&quot;
The Republican senator said the plan would also require the creation of a Treasury Secretary oversight commission and caps on severance pay for top executives -- something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the secretary.
On Sunday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp have become more self-confident - this is how &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the CSU&#39;s dramatic defeat in his article &quot;Bavaria&#39;s revolution wipes out their fathers&quot;.
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The epochal break is at the same time a problem for Christian Democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The CSU disaster did not come as a complete surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end that had already become apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
Because ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and fell below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s
This was repeated three years ago in the federal elections of 2005, in other words during the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization consistently pursued by the CSU in the federal state ultimately devoured its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but misjudged the pace considerably. But secularization, educational success, and the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria did not have an impact on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with an increase in options. And that has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks it has been the classic groups of citizens who have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial middle class and voters with a high school diploma or university degree.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled &quot;Who with whom? Party leaders cautious on coalition issues&quot;, the conservative Viennese daily newspaper reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens have not yet decided on a coalition.
The new elections are over and now it&#39;s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly showed their cards.
SPÖ leader Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as vice chancellor.
As he said, voters voted out the Bowl-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
However, Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tried to interfere in internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is currently completely open whether his party will go into opposition or into the coalition, and these questions should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
&quot;In order to prevent red-black, we are prepared to assume government responsibility,&quot; said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is being hosted this year by France, the country that holds the EU Council Presidency, began today in Paris.
Addressing the plenary, Lívia Járóka, MEP for Fidesz of the European People&#39;s Party, drew particular attention to educational segregation as one of the most serious violations of rights that Roma children face and as the main obstacle to their need for recognition.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Affairs Minister Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the Fidesz press office of MEPs, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination when looking for a job, the Roma are being pushed out of the labor market primarily because of their low level of education.
&quot;The vast majority of Roma youngsters do not have a secondary education and, thanks to a poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree.&quot;
Járóka also emphasized that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in asserting other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU member states.
According to the deputies, it is important that as wide a circle as possible - ie Roma and non-Roma - become aware of these connections.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; and through income and sales taxes, they contribute to national spending.
&quot;As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - bad and segregated education must be stopped&quot; - says Lívia Járóka.
As the MEP explained, a common, goal- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector. Correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential for this.
&quot;We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,&quot; Járóka demanded.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in line with the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot;.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to contract with a customer because of a person&#39;s drug use.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
&quot;There are data protection programs that always link the use of drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we&#39;ll entrust the chickens to the fox,&quot; the Washington Post quoted Richard Dick, developer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies set the fees and the amounts paid out in the event of damage depending on the state of health of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance will not be taken out in the first place.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer&#39;s identification number, he gets the data from the pharmacies for the last year and a half, i.e. which preparations were bought, and the program uses this to calculate which illness the customer is suffering from and what his state of health is is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the inference would be that his blood lipid levels are intractably high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier so that insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
From the insurers&#39; point of view, the latter is a high-risk factor, while the former are not.
Special companies have been set up to query and process the data, which ask the patient for their consent before obtaining the data.
They are now required to do so by law, although omissions have so far not been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug use. They thus provide an even more precise picture of the patient&#39;s state of health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time controlling its use is becoming more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, since otherwise the insurance companies would not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left at the mercy of the fox.
CSU: temporary mercy
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates have been adjourned.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in office, the only question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party conference on the last weekend in October.
However, the much scolded duo has already indicated that they do not want to stick to their chairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot; in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union still achieved 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was the &quot;sole ruler&quot; in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of internal party restructuring, Huber&#39;s potential successor, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, is also included in the reconnaissance team that is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing &quot;Freie Wahler&quot; (Free Voters) about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that Gabriele Pauli, whose anti-Stoiber behavior the Huber-Beckstein duo exploited at first and then mercilessly dumped, entered the legislature with the &quot;Free Voters&quot; list.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been pulling the strings from the background so far, will play an active role in this transition process. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the &quot;bitterest day of his political career.&quot;
On Monday, Huber made a few venomous remarks towards the CDU - in his view, the CSU deserved far more support from its sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a great deal to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a concerted effort, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the CSU&#39;s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis in the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
No opposition deputy made it into the Ukrainian parliament in Sunday&#39;s elections.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegal counting of the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has been doing without an opposition for decades. Nevertheless, before yesterday&#39;s elections, the opposing party, which came together under the name &quot;United Democratic Forces&quot; (ODS), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, this time some MPs of the would &quot;allow&quot; opposition in Parliament.
That is why the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia thanks to rising prices for natural gas imports. Loans have even been taken out to mitigate price hikes, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline running through the country, to the Russians. Behind the expectations of the opposition was the hope that Ukraine would want to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians were banned from entering the EU because of the political system, which was classified as anti-democratic.
The OECD election evaluation report, which emphasized the positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections - caused a temporary relaxation.
However, the rapid report by the OECD already criticized the campaign on Monday - according to which members of the opposition are not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is open to even minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
&quot;We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started,&quot; Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although &quot;the powerful have become afraid of letting even one opposition figure into parliament&quot;.
The opposition is not planning protests over the results, but rather trying to convince voters of the need for economic reform.
&quot;We face many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are blocking our distribution, but still I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones&quot; - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the creation of social security.
&quot;Thanks to the country&#39;s indebtedness and the growing trade deficit, it&#39;s only a matter of time before the graveyard-like &quot;social security&quot; begins to crumble,&quot; Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Ria Novosti news agency: &quot;People believe in actions, not words.&quot; The lack of opposition is therefore evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global meal plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
As the European Union and India are mutually each other&#39;s leading trading partners, this was the main theme at the ninth summit, along with other global issues.
Today is also the day of the Franco-Indian Summit, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic superpower that should be given more voice and say on international issues, member states have so far been unable to agree on whether to support New Delhi&#39;s permanent membership of the UN Security Council should or not.
This issue was not discussed at all at yesterday&#39;s ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and chief diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached according to which trade is to be doubled in the next five years, ie increased to a good 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not that ambitious.
With this in mind, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were legally combined into one agreement, so that air traffic will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The goal is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is India&#39;s number one partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
These included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides condemned in the strongest possible terms. The convening of a UNO conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU emphasized that it is sticking to its energy and climate program, which means that pollutant emissions are to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, which is why both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is today visiting the French capital where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris is hoping for orders worth EUR 20 billion from French companies to build nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will be spread across the 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor at the event.
Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space &quot;Punto Italia&quot;.
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives related to publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is declining across the board, but especially in the adult and youth sections.
Brunetta: &quot;From now on we&#39;ll have breakfast before work&quot;
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for officials to enter and exit.
From today, the measure will come into force against those smart guys who first stamp and then go for coffee during working hours.
The new &quot;anti-loafer law&quot; was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
&quot;&gt;&quot;Revolving doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services&quot;, said Minister Brunetta.
&quot;Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,&quot; emphasizes Brunetta again.
The installation in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers ends with the Palazzo Chigi.
According to Masi: &quot;the choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value&quot;.
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary General assured: &quot;This process was supported by everyone, cooperation came from all sides&quot;.
All in all, there is no longer any breakfast during working hours; No more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: &quot;A good cappuccino at 7 o&#39;clock works wonders&quot;.
During a session of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the minister announces that &quot;in three months, the absences of civil servants have been reduced to 50%, that is 60,000 more people a year at work&quot;.
He adds that there is a need to improve the efficiency of Italy&#39;s public administration
&quot;Their salary dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as in the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate&quot;.
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have banded together to oppose the Brunetta decree under the codacon-backed appeal.
&quot;While the Minister for Public Service is making a name for himself with figures on fewer absences at work - the consumer advice center writes - the population of &#39;active lazybones&#39; continues to grow.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have banded together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree.&quot;
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of sick workers, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the minister&#39;s innovations are also being challenged.
Napolitano: &quot;Prevention of accidents at work is crucial&quot;
Every day in Italy there are 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
In fact, for 2007, the data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the number of fatal accidents at work was around 1,200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day for Victims of Industrial Accidents in all provinces of Italy, drawing the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
&quot;The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is,&quot; confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his &quot;great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to protecting injured workers, to helping the families of the victims and to raising public awareness&quot;.
&quot;An indignant &quot;Basta&quot; was raised; understandable for tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, cause some fuss in the media and sympathy from the public. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that even change in their own momentum can repeat&quot;.
Napolitano does not hide the fact that &quot;there is definitely also a resource problem: significant investments must be made in education and information.&quot;
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school contexts on the part of young people approaching the world of work.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness. A legislative norm must be put into effect and improved.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed &quot;how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards firm rules aimed at putting an end to the problem set&quot;.
&quot;The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high,&quot; said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
&quot;We don&#39;t want this &#39;positive trend&#39; to mean less attention. That&#39;s exactly what causes the tragedy in the end.&quot;
&quot;We believe that fundamentally we are doing too little to counteract the phenomenon of accidents. We can fight against it through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary in our opinion – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers, starting at school&quot;.
&quot;A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is required&quot;.
Mercandelli also referred to &quot;the progressive deterioration in protection for victims of industrial accidents&quot; and denounced the &quot;abolition of the social security system, which we have been fighting in recent years&quot;.
&quot;The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an industrial accident does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, as decided from time to time by a legislature&quot;.
Mp3 player charged: risk of hearing damage
Loud music for a long period of time with portable music devices such as B. Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is the report of the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report distributed today in Brussels.
&quot;The report - reads a note - shows that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music on portable music devices a week for more than an hour a day for at least five years are at risk of permanent hearing loss.&quot;
&quot;I am concerned that so many young people who habitually turn up the volume on portable music devices and cell phones are unknowingly irreparably damaging their hearing,&quot; said Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;The scientific findings - according to the EU - show a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is raising awareness among consumers and making that information public property.
In light of this scientific knowledge, we need to re-examine the control systems already in place so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology&quot;.
Brussels commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
&quot;The scientists - concludes the EU communication - confirm that the concerns are right and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and those affected, will now investigate the necessary measures to protect children and young people better from the noise, coming out of portable music players and similar devices&quot;.
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music players to 100 dB. Concern about the damage that could come from excessive exposure to noise.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of exposure to noise.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud music (louder than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, they are already exceeding the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level apply to the workplace.
Those who push music beyond this limit risk total hearing loss within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of users of such devices, which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno launches the &quot;Commission for the Future of the Capital&quot;
We&#39;ll start today, it should be over in March, and we&#39;ll take stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the &quot;Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome&quot;. The Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project will be completed, the City and Municipal Councils will evaluate the analyzes and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the &quot;official stamp&quot; of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June can.
&quot;The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it&quot;, - emphasizes Alemanno. &quot;She will put forward proposals for a development plan for Rome, of which the city and municipal councils will remain the political leaders.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the commission will be dissolved again, since such a project must have a timed end point.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the commission&quot;.
Alemanno replies to anyone who questions the competence of the commission because its opinion is not binding: &quot;Everything depends on the work that the commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look at a longer period of time so that we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city from a deeper perspective&quot;.
The Mayor of Rome is very keen to clarify that &quot;This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think. It will attract the best minds of the capital&quot;.
According to Alemanno, &quot;it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to allow our city to make a qualitative leap - which it really needs - and thus take a common step towards the future&quot;.
A future, according to the Lord Mayor of Rome, which &quot;will not only be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further&quot;, not only in terms of Rome&#39;s role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.&quot;
Obama - the first anti-American President? Here&#39;s an explanation
A well-known American politician who is keen to be seen as independent wrote: &quot;Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, whose decisions decimated the US economy and who maintained (and still does today in private) ties with enemy Islam.&quot;
The attacks against Obama are getting more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: &quot;This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office in a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!&quot;.
Actually, these attacks don&#39;t mean much; they are racist attacks and they don&#39;t answer the voters&#39; question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win by a wide margin.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with their hearts and not with their heads.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the voting booth will we probably know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here is a US mentality that has been kept hidden until recently.
&quot;Say what you want and we&#39;ll decide who we&#39;re going to crouch for, whether it&#39;s Obama or McCain.&quot;
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something never heard before - only now that the black candidate&#39;s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes has Bush made during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Still, Iraq remains Bush&#39;s weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place faces a huge task.
UNITED STATES. The financial collapse also left its mark on journalists: the cuts can already be felt in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet for the &quot;killer&quot; of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they declared to those responsible for the information that they were not really concerned about the general credibility.
You don&#39;t feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the major problems caused by the cuts affecting the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
It&#39;s a problem that needs to be solved, say the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, is to be prevented from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that national-level journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the executives even have around 65%.
Print vs Broadcast.
It&#39;s not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web is headed.
Major publishing groups are making their way onto the Internet, considered by many to be the &quot;killer&quot; of the printing press.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted they wanted to embrace the new technology in the hope &quot;it would bring something good to journalism&quot;.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at the national level are confident their reporters share their values, compared to just 23% at the local level.
Some think it has to do with &quot;safety at work&quot;.
Farm managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
For journalists it is 30%.
The topic of &quot;safe work&quot; in a team (our &quot;editors&quot;, editor&#39;s note) is always a topical issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers bid as they please and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it
The editors-in-chief very often get very high wages, the editor, on the other hand, can sometimes only get 10,000 euros a month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for vacation, things get complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so many after the third, eventually reaching 15 vacation days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often &quot;get sick&quot; during the year.
It&#39;s a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Division of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent&#39;s application. This had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is brought against Coppola for bankruptcy in the investigation into the counter-agreement in the Unipol-Bnl takeover case. determined.
During the course of his trial last week, his release from house arrest was commuted to compulsory residency in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (which the prosecution had opposed) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain accusatory evidence.
The elite are in danger
The phenomenon became apparent a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House&#39;s $700 billion austerity package: a large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday&#39;s New York Times, which reports how the crisis is dividing at a rapid pace the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community and the neocon that is hostile to &quot;those in Washington&quot; and the financial world, and is winning voters primarily in the south and center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise largely to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake heralds or even already represents: not only in the USA, but also in the entire West and perhaps also beyond this will be affected by them.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light in these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state combined with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties abroad while managing a vast amount of the wealth of private households residing in a single state.
This poses an immediate political problem for governments: how to behave towards the affected families, who also represent an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears global in economic terms, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been sidelined and lost its right to speak: clear evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, being divided into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; Rescue plans, new rules, and above all the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became more and more serious, only the USA is in the economic position to save itself without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two prerequisites that should not be overestimated - under certain circumstances - on which no other international organization and no market will be able to fall back in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is perfectly consistent with the increasing importance that has recently been attached in economics to a very closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked total kingdom, into a kingdom of ever more differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we suddenly have to realize how our future is becoming more and more of the will depend on essential material things: water, crops and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nonetheless bound to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory has an advantage over another who lives in a cropless, waterless, or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief interlude.
Anyone who says territory, who government, whoever says politics also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to get things done.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation at the existing leaderships, especially those of economics, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more troubling aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of impracticality, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of Western managers.
The conviction seems to be paving the way among large parts of the population that it is not just the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, the content of which is represents the majority as more and more foreign and outdated.
So, underground, the demand for leadership feeds a branching but powerful movement of disempowerment of the ruling class and the traditional political establishment. This is manifested in unforeseen voter &quot;revolts&quot; and in the sudden shift in collective sentiment of recent times: beginning with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, through the collapse of the Labor Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their stature, are having more and more problems of understanding and are therefore less representative of what is happening in the lower ranks today social strata of the West and is being intensified by the financial crisis and driven to the point of being oversized.
In view of all this, it would simply be an exaggeration to speak of a &quot;rebellion of the masses&quot;.
Keeping your eyes wide open, however, is certainly not the case.
The super glue that blows up walls
Defying the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and being able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which now appears to be almost there.
With an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to fix a body weighing 100 kg to a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of the researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already in use, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
&quot;You can think of the principle behind the glue as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti,&quot; explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the gecko&#39;s feet, which are covered in microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect grip.
Tests conducted with different materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper showed that the new adhesive is 10 times stronger than the reptile&#39;s feet&#39;s gripping ability and at the same time &quot;can be easily removed from the wall,&quot; according to Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
HIKING ALONG WALLS? &quot;This material could be used as an ephemeral glue,&quot; Liming Dai adds.
Like climbing walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers are thinking of a less intriguing use, such as connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the field of space travel.
So for now, the superheroes will have to wait.
THE DIFFERENT KIND OF RESEARCH – the University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicating itself to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, clean themselves of dust by moving on a surface, thereby always maintaining perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed mainly in the summer due to their refreshing quality and richness in vitamins, can cause serious health problems if taken at the same time as certain essential medications, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in connection with the use of medication. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he sounded the alarm again: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to such an extent that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of the patients is endangered.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs, such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
PHARMACEUTICALS AT RISK – The same drug agency warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, urging them to be careful about what they drink in conjunction with drugs such as diazepane or methadone.
IT&#39;S NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal from Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: &quot;Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are then free to change the consumer information.
It is therefore advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still any ambiguities, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor,&quot; emphasizes the expert from the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration&#39;s economic and foreign policies.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron&#39;s collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more pivotal in US history than the attacks.
A prediction that was answered with quite a bit of polemics and that was held up to the economists years later, but which today is proving to be completely correct.
&quot;I&#39;m surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the Enron or Worldcom collapse scandals has faded from public view,&quot; Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an &quot;economist of great value&quot; but also a trivializer with a &quot;very aggressive style, particularly aimed at the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.&quot;
Open Office, the third version of the &quot;Anti-Microsoft&quot; package is released
The OpenOffice.org 3.0 release day has arrived; as a free replacement for Microsoft&#39;s Office, the open source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented to the public with some innovations: in addition to a revised and now more spartan start menu, compatibility with Apples is finally guaranteed from the ground up Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Compatibility with Microsoft&#39;s Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice, was also taken into account.
Some new features are also interesting, such as the one that allows reducing the size of PowerPoint presentations, which e.g. B. makes it easier to send via email. This also includes the ability to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
It is now also possible to generate &quot;hybrid&quot; PDF files, which expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: spreadsheets can now be edited multi-handedly by different users, avoiding conflicts when changes are made; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a color in order to guarantee a better correction process.
Some companies are in the process of releasing various OpenOffice functions on the Internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result should be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download from the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, while the fact that it is free of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also precisely in the business area where OpenOffice could make a big splash: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word equivalent text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the better-known Access; and finally Draw, a graphics engine.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case has opened within the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, classified third and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L&#39;Equipe on its website.
Team Gerolsteiner&#39;s Kohl, 26, is the fourth rider to test positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo. This was previously the case for the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyzes of Kohl&#39;s blood samples are among those carried out by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories in recent weeks.
If the cross-checks now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from racing for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, and also claimed the jersey for best climber.
ISSUE IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKED: IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy, &quot;the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants&quot; who are received with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a lengthy article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after opening a packet of biscuits had stolen.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the &quot;Paradox of the North&quot;: the northern regions are those with &quot;the greatest integration and job opportunities&quot; and yet &quot;the highest levels of anti-immigrationist sentiment and support for the... Lega Nord is recorded&quot;.
The Times cites other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno in confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants.
And not only this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and to speed up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President underline: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism.&quot;
Billionaire Steve Fossett&#39;s light aircraft, which disappeared a year ago, has been found
The light aircraft belonging to Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared while flying over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, has been found.
The pieces were found on a high plateau at an altitude of 3000 m in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely refuted the last doubts during a press conference: &quot;The plane has been located and a squad was dispatched. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was on day of his disappearance.&quot;
Mr. Anderson also further confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The American Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced that a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, a crew was dispatched to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett departed from Yerington, Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Finally, yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett&#39;s personal belongings were found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identification cards bearing the Fossetts name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had carved his place in history through a long string of records.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he succeeded as the first person to circle the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he circumnavigated the world in a single non-stop flight on an airplane.
One of his numerous records is a high-altitude flight of 15,445 m over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don&#39;t expect
An SUV that deviates from the usual schemes thanks to its original design and the particular lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz tried to breathe new life into the sector.
Precisely because of its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17, will also be unconventional.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new look, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum of effort, which is to be carried out in different phases, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by November 15th.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses that will be distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model .
In fact, the car will appear to stand out from the poster it is depicted on.
Then, with the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments in order to be reassembled as a whole.
Without a doubt, it is Mercedes&#39; intention to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotypical field with this advertisement.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk being banned from the stadium
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls that the whole of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the &quot;Ultras Italia&quot; group, which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, to be honest, didn&#39;t cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They wear the tricolor on which the militants&#39; cities appear: these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing extremist fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc provided Italian fans with 144 tickets for the game: all of them were named and therefore easy to check.
In fact, they were all checked by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already charged in this respect, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the Tifosi arrested or identified in the riots can count on a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban preventing access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there is a fear of copycats who could follow these little more than 150.
&quot;This brand must be exited immediately, and under no circumstances should such behavior be justified,&quot; according to the Viminal.
Therefore, &quot;Keep your eyes open, especially with a view to the national team&#39;s game on Wednesday in Lecce.&quot;
In fact, there is a small core of Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) will meet, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
&quot;Duce-Duce shouts and the raised right arm during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria this is not a crime...&quot;
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post from Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the chief of police in Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now come from.
While it is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, there is no doubt that the behavior of these 150-200 people was disgraceful.
&quot;I&#39;m not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are punished in the country in which they are committed.
So far, this group has remained in check, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and what will happen.
But let&#39;s also talk about the whistles during the Mamelis hymn: this is not a crime either, but allow me, the education is lacking...&quot;.
Female students are victims of the high rent prices of up to 900 euros per room
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the tenants&#39; union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
&quot;This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. Scores of students are effectively losing their right to study because their families are not able to support them to such an extent&quot; - said Laura Mariani, in charge of Sunia - &quot;in In these cities, the high student demand is causing the market to deform, which has also harmed the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers contain a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent limit, unauthorized subletting.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary measures that lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
A closer look at the study reveals that in Milan a place to sleep in the Brianza district costs about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere area) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area or even 900 euros in the Vittoria area.
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a bed, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the areas around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
The rents in the areas around the other universities in Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who move to the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bed, for a room the price ranges from 400 to 600 euros in the most expensive areas, Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
Prices are lower in the smallest towns, but they carry more weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents 25-30% above the average are requested by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities are closing their historic cinema halls
The historic cinemas are closing because of the preferential multiplex cinemas.
&quot;A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.&quot;
This image, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, effectively describes what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-screen complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death of the single-screen cinema in the centre. A process that not only appears inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
Historical places full of memories are mostly affected, &quot;it&#39;s like losing a friend with whom you have traveled a stretch of road full of emotions,&quot; says the director of the film &quot;Nuovo Cinema Paradiso&quot;, who gave him the Oscar and the big one 20 years ago Cannes Prize. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this bill was mostly paid by the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The hardest-hit regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany at 44 and Lombardy at 41.
This shows that the main culprits are multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely in these three regions that the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: Lombardy tops the lists with 195 in the last 5 years, 81 in both the Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
&quot;The business has developed in an irrational way&quot;, says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, &quot;although it is useful that new structures are created, the priority is to preserve the existing ones, because a hall closes in of the city, not all of its regular customers are willing to go to a multiplex cinema on the outskirts instead of the old one.
And here the missing budget for the fund of the trade association remains: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to approx. 10 million euros.
It is a shame from an ethical point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed&quot;.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city that, because of the fears for the old cinema halls, decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historic center and in the outskirts.
Among the envisaged measures are also tax advantages for the operators of cinemas, as well as advantages for the public in terms of local transport: they will be allowed to drive into the traffic-restricted areas of the center and also park at cheaper parking rates.
&quot;It&#39;s a good initiative,&quot; says Giuseppe Tornatore, &quot;I hope that other cities will follow our example and also come up with new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to counteract the superpower of multiplexes, because today&#39;s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the &quot;Supercinema&quot; of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the crucial point that led me to found the &quot;Nuovo cinema Paradiso&quot;, also when I had been toying with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, places where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to look at the dust-covered posters.
Links between politics and &#39;Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the municipality&#39;s decisions to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by Calabria&#39;s anti-mafia lawyers against the mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and his deputy, Rosario Schiavone, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia transactions, are serious.
Also handcuffed were Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who shares the same name as the clan boss, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal Mafia organizations, back then compensation of 10 million euros.
&quot;Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm,&quot; the lawyers write, &quot;the two local administrations had decided to pay lawyer Piromalli money for consulting work.&quot;
&quot;This made it possible for the mafia group - according to the judges - to officially enter the town halls and have a say in the politics of public administration.&quot;
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region &quot;it is far from exceptional to come across links between local administrations and organized crime.&quot; &quot;There are places where mafia concentration is greater than others, where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the &#39;Ndrangheta: heroes who get a clean slate.&quot;
This morning&#39;s arrests follow those of last July, which police say the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration - local politicians had been relieved of their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 runoff.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the municipal council to be dissolved.
He complained to Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political and strategic reasons. However, the judges explain in connection with this morning&#39;s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
A wiretapping operation related to the investigations into the Dal Torrione case revealed a willingness to accommodate the wishes of an entrepreneur known to be a representative of the large group surrounding the Piromalli - thereby making the actions of public administration identical to the interests of this clan .&quot;
When the energy rises from the waves, the big ones suddenly appear
It&#39;s a never-ending source of cash that covers over 70% of the planet&#39;s surface and it&#39;s only now that the world&#39;s big energy companies seem to be realizing this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking to, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not coincidentally, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, people forgot about the idea of ocean energy, but now environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world&#39;s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also currents and tides.
Giants Attack.
The first company to bet on ocean energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it appeared to be a revolutionary move.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are relying on marine energy generation.
&quot;Chevron is studying these technologies&quot; - a spokesman for a company known to the US giant told The Wall Street Journal - and is considering the possibility of working with us.&quot;
This involves obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that should not be underestimated, especially when you consider that the USA is still producing oil in Alaska and that President Bush only recently started plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York-based Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey-based Ocean Power are also investing in the new industry; Even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Technologies still in need of improvement.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects like the one in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale requires technologies with far greater environmental impact.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure inside the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The current is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are just waiting for government approval. Part of the energy obtained could also be used for military installations.
Meanwhile, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and parking lot using subsea turbines in New York&#39;s East River.
The water movements during the tide drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotary movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Generation Research, the potential that lies in the tides deserves special interest at the moment.
Although an irregular phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and even waves, and are therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that prompted states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - for 2009 up to 35 million are already planned.
