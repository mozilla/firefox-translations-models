The goods have cost under 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the default value....
I am a major customer and so it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should include the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the PRS ORG a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another option to credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's look briefly, help, bring the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough child themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best assess whether this fits your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany for hours when falling asleep.
Purely legally it is probably questionable.
Perhaps the statement of the psychologist comes.
Because if something actually happened like a burn, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is your discretion, of course;)
Help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but the title doesn't want to come up with the title anymore, maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treatment.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his big cats in the enclosure.
The case is adopted by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, comes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a small niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before every suicide is commissioned to go to the place of the self-murder and to document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist conducts a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that is suppressed in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumping out the window one moves to death on purpose)
This face fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough plot I am quite certain that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ever, I have the password for the Wi-Fi not available.
Must contact my husband.
But that may take place.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference transferred back ?

Very hard to grab.
Did not work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotives of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "cube cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital central control panel.
It handles all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable control panels.
For control panels that can program only the CVs of 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three further Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage.
It also stops with a Selectrix® brake device.
An ABC shuttle train system enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC orbits.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster booster booster
New Omikron cases are always getting politics and science in the UK.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer until New Year's Day.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster than previously sought to progress in the corona booster vaccination in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the colosset, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British Government will also provide assistance to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the country parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let yourselves booster now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa

I am in favour of everyone imagining with pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to kick an officer over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine each other with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only one I bought today is not possible
Obviously, the chair had an immortal that was not visible when it came to 
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only tries on the PRS ORG.
But this has been working since approx.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books through the website and then read it to the PRS ORG.
I bought 6 PRS ORG but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want to add that you please 2 chairs to the order and charge me.
[CW] The feeling if I cannot help.
Content warning: I will write something a little detailed about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we could not help them.
I am quite aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what is the reason, maybe it's afraid to leave the usual social environment, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of wresting the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not simply have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help myself in any case... I know I can't.
But it never becomes easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: what is the show suitable for "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said with a review of the cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in the stomach."
However, this did not lie down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
But more than the bare result disappointed the way of the performance.
Representing a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quota was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in saying and no less than 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was delivered by John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we simply weren't concentrated enough, and we didn't implement what we trained."
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite otherwise: "To win a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10 000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts that scored 22 points and directed the match of his team.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already covered 39:59.
Along with Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to rag.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of the maximum 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
we had another mail address earlier, but that I changed.
Yes, I contacted me a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and therefore wrote them down again.
We originally registered six months ago.
Always as if from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing else will become of it.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instruction" to contain the coronavirus.
Other his performances planned during the Advent season must also be cancelled, as it is stated on the website of the singer, which becomes 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates, which had already been moved in 2020, due to the pandemic.
Born on 12. In December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a young person.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women is not a problem" (2013) - reached the second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, blonde hair strictly combed back and looked at etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-speaking musical landscape.
With the "Good day, lovely luck" program, he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new housing is created by expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in Berlin in a referendum.
"Not a new apartment is created with an expropriation, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Dayspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rental will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, is by the way the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not conclude talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rental market nevertheless does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 deaths by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the US.
More than 100 deaths could be killed in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometres long swallow of devastation, especially in the native state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was happening, everything is gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He counts with up to one hundred deaths in the limb state of Kentucky alone, the official figures rise every hour.
Hi, I just saw that she sells out showcase 'NAME'.
That is a shame.
Is it still produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is there any possibility to order this display case in another country?
until when are you logging in?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand this, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an Artike or had given up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was arriving or being processed, since I have not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees cash premiums for vaccination.
This means that they are in line with the social partners of the ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He has moved to a company that he has blasphemed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year since.
He has obviously not sewn himself on his old place and has sought something else.
You are allowed to do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.

Help with the first own campaign
Boron to Grusse!
I just lead the adventure About the Gryphon Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual files are thought out and now I am writing the entry adventure and stumble about my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a carriage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to wait for the hero and lure them into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever the player can think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
In case of non-remembers, the goblins lurk the hero in a hollow road and flank the carriage is armed with three left and right of me arches, while two stop the wagon with spears.
If it comes to fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found and then found and healed by the son of village schools, a half-eleven.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this same half-eleve intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again apart.
And put back together.
Unfortunately it still does not work.
That's why I would still like to send her back
If you can then let the back tickets come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the PRS ORG.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more over the season, so I want to keep up with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was abandoned today in the middle of the F2 race in order to have the F1 preliminary reporting begin on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could have been shown.
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons, the F1 takes priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, since Sky UK has entrusted the race to end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then there was an unresay in the F1 times with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation was already in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is this opportunity for stages.
I believe that you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 with a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the theme rules.
Generally do not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that this is a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, both of which simply make it unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (astonishingly unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he obviously does not take this seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising takes its own at Sky, in the exit round Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, how you can listen to F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although Glock and Baumgartner have to be praised for their work, this alone does not leave me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel to transmit the F1.
Unirciously, RTL does a better job except for the advertising in the four races they are still allowed to transfer.
At least that's what the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable station.
I would like to feel interested in your opinion.
On the here: PRS snow, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not done anything.
The First Lady told me that it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two PRS ORG on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect more emanators.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump, depending on the model, they are also ideal for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you find in the shop) or with a decor that convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here is a treasure chest, shell or similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an Auström or similar one by means of an air hose 4/6 mm... and you can start.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher as the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is placed deeper like the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards, which runs the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packets that consume little energy
Even if we indicate the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, it is packed daily and the packages are also picked up here every day.
If everything goes well on the go, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset, just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that not everyone has understanding for the whole employees who also work in the freight forwarding system...of course, here does not stop a corona.
Please do not rate the same badly just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively at the parcel services.
One likes to scold these services, even if we say at the moment... they have a damn hard time
This is also very different from region.
Do not be anyone evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can one also order the legs in bright?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers, have undertaken a short trip into space.
They were transported by the "New Shepard" missile system from the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Saturday.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly elected astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometres.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of Alan Shepard, who flew into space in 1961 as Nasa astronauts (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honour of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bes, and his son.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his stakes and had to do everything himself.
She had just flown along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space right away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed slowed by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the earth as the border with space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-adventure trip from Blue Origin: at the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject actually quite exciting in itself and also in the laboratory are not bothered by me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about job prospects before my studies was already informed at the time that I would certainly like to study and will study until I doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially depressing the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you keep hearing from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would be really interested in times:
1) As what are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you Studied / What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole time?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and may be thinking about starting their studies in 2022 and making an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have experience writes this time :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore only now a post.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a great stress at our company.
As it seems, the even before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "ascent" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a day of bridge, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what was going on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely have to get out before driveway, order here order there, everything *naturally* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be?
Or because people want to achieve as much as in a shortened week in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also naming a lot.
What is this self-levelling about holidays?
Why do we still have holidays for if we are not allowed to treat them properly?
The stress could not come from above, the colleagues were all independently so on top.
My question is simple: are we just the same, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical nature?
Or do you know this in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will join the feast by baking and making with her son cookies.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to kill: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I've finally got to go."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the moult and the formation of new plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 Ã...g biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird keeping are caused exclusively by dietary defects.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nourishment of the bird is a particularly rich and balanced protein nourishing condition for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of the animal losses that occur during the moult are based on a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly considered and balanced.
No further vitamin supplement should be given during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or via soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
E-Lok E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME magazine 11/1968, used with playing traces and disappearances see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for those of heavy coal coal cablesBACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are processed in an operational way
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn company commissioned AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive, which was to be able to carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h on this line.
The top speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the Siemens sucker works with the electric part of the Siemens shooting range through the delivery of the mechanical part as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with the AEG deposited engine with the delivery of the mechanical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were retained as reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The processing worthy of all six locomotives was found in the Dessau train repair shop.
[4] When the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were processed in 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were processed in 1959, whereby the other engines served as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, available in larger quantities were preferred.
Only when the E 94 was it foreseeable that the number of processing could not be increased further, the E 95 moved into the focus of processing.
[4]The locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They attended the Halle P railway plant in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation plan, mostly off coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control system at locomotives proved problematically with increasing age.
So it often happened that shooters stick to switching acts.
Then the Beimann, who is constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to loosen the shooters with a hammer and a wooden wedge while driving.
Damage to the traction engines often occurred and led to months of failures at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only somewhat wanted to occupy what would have caused a problem in train operation due to these difficulties with the engines and the sighting conditions of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were parked in the middle of 1969, they were last followed by the E 95 01, which on 5th year. October 1970 the service acknowledged.
The planned new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were disassembled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system on Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initially external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as an unoperationable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is looking after the museum in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community of Bw Halle P have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time to an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint, with the transformers being checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching off branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines to Leipzig were revisited to the Central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive in self-work is necessary, dusted, with playing tracks, basement smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can showcase labels and storage traces.
Yes the F-parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The central beam is held by two feet.. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build up the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones.
When will they be sent?
no no flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right one of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing they fulfil their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get this sent?
Hello 'NAME', should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured during a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage caused in the six-digit euro range, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to two residents, two residents were taken to the hospital with light smoking poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume that they were intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
UÃ3ur'ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Until now, Biontech head U'ur'ahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness had moved him to do so, saying this.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, U ur Ã...ahin, has published a photo that shows how to obtain a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was not supposedly vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote "ahin" in a post in the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me, on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life from me.
He fights against a serious COVID-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, continued writing.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Usu'ahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine itself," said Ã...ahin at the time.
There is a prioritisation in the vaccination of the vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to their own information.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights emanated on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire caused the lights to lights in several communities with 41,000 affected residents and residents.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely rectified in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers at THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbouring assistance.
The supplier thanked the patients for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology division, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the West Net Facilities were initially only able to put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to the information provided by Westnetz, the fire, which broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m., severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Complex cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 pm.
Since 11.15 p.m., the most recently those affected by the failure has also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
The authorities had also called for neighbouring assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday after setting up an emergency power supply.
"It is now important that citizens are looking after the elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire equipment houses when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The inhabitants of retirement homes were primarily in the focus during the establishment and operation of emergency power generators.
In addition, according to the authorities, care places were temporarily set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!

We wanted those with table tops diameter of ’NUMBER’
we got 155cm in diameter.
Today, my PRS ORG arrived, but I cannot push them into each other and thus shorten them.
Can you help me there?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback

I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I did not restart the e-PRS ORG.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this

I have to work in between!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush onto the model for the first time with a new paint, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 lines.
You can do this on the later inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup that is no longer visible.
The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke next to the stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quickly wiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to a separate brush at the very end.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models reach faithful appearance through the decals or. Decals.
From national signs on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates in car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit is easier to bond before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and settle it.
Decals are also called water sliding images, because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the wet water.
Then you shoot the picture only a small piece of paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you remove the backing paper off the side.
Attention: Always check whether the image is sitting properly before you shoot it completely from the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tears.
Suck outside water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the job until where I have read.
On Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages
ok thank you!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without problems?
Fertility treatment at PKV / What is an insurance case?
Hello everyone,
we were some time in fertility treatment, now when it comes to the settlement with the B&B, it suddenly crosses it.
In turn:
We had applied for the fertility rail system in advance at the PKV and received the approval of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time framework, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet count on the BUA.
We again requested that the costs be assumed and 3 further attempts were granted.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more than promised, logically the most expensive party calculation) we submitted the bills to the B&B and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "the insured event begins with medical treatment begins, it ends when needs to treatment no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to reimburse the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Could the Social Health Office have had to point out in the promises that further attempts are falling at birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts were to give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to reach them best again
All right.
We will not order anything from them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend 'NAME' (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now you are telling me that I first have to send the thing back.
I can't help that the dresser arrives completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I have still not received a refund by ’PRS’ORG’
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I cannot procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the closet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of ’PRS’ORG’
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Thread of the week: Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What is irritating about it?
And what do you not like at all?
Am a very good customer of you, already have 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you
With best regards
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, there is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can proclaim "half a victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not endured the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for International Sciences and Politics (SWP).
This limbo - Belarus does not give very small, but the EU feels itself a winner - is continuing for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not closely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It appears to be unable to prevail if a Member State comes to mind to make its thing," as is currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: an agreement in principle on asylum policy is made more difficult, since the line of "border management, border management, border management" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday during the night and brought back to the border, said a spokeswoman to the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza.
According to the data, a soldier was hit on his face and had to receive medical care of a military doctor.
In total, Border Guard 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being a leader in Minsk that he has attracted it with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press segments, Poland and Lithuania were sealing sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the people's countries of origin to stop departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly sing up thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two regular violence during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an opposition.
The Silver Arrows suspect two violin breaches of the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second appeal was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
After Mercedes view, the protocol was not complied with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was bossed for his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving before him.
I check that.
I talk to the bank and report me to you again

I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an item, but I did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been included.
It doesn't have everyone the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your error you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact Mrs. 'NAME'.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I respectively. With a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the 'PRS' nightstand and a return label will receive an email.
This e-mail did not come so far.
The package still wants to bring today to PRS ORG.

But just because he says he is not an anti-Semite means nothing.
This is like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
They will not admit them.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it complete.
Yes wow then you are taking as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
For my reason, a God has got the whole going.
But once you are creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is only tapped nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take any further seriousness like Collegeah
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible.
The specially aplanattically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass up to the edge zone with a practical forgrain and colour-free use.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnifications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, even with impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection covering.
If the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instruction manual (in German and English).

I have already contacted you under the customer contact with the number 'PHONENUMBER'.
yes, but it was said before.
You cannot deliver from England because of 'PRS'ORG.
Fire sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women select the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many a strange situation when selling the fir.
Once a man is said to have returned home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has experienced many a strange situation.
The pre-Christmas season always makes this much funny, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I will be gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price.
Then I will rate this accordingly!
We do not need to engage in discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat, which is grilled on a spinning spit.
And therefore both have their name.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which does not sound so delicious.
Functional fiber issues + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and used Devolo DLan, which received 50 Mbit and sent out perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer arrives the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms located from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (No.45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here too.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is via the power line with fiber optic so much Internet speed?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay cable in the house LAN.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an account here.
That's why I would be happy about an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Anyone who would have thought now would be quiet at the current accounts, see themselves deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirmed the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered for the call money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Group-Sector Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already walked down to a border of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as were the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less after figures from the Verivox internet portal.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even been entitled to the regional court of Berlin in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already being discussed whether the institutions should form provisions if the upper instances also declare negative interest rates in principle and that many millions of bank customers have to be repaid back.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
It is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a way of downhilling and descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip during the day (yes, read correctly: an ONLY chip from the bag).
It is actually a wonder that the hearts of the female and male fans are equally flying to her.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck - and still seeks great love.
And has cut off the baby's wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
She hurt.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn puts out the gloves and wiped the sweat off the forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Räikkönen had to leave the Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishes his career in the Motorsport premier class.
As a farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He scored 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60. World Cup victory - Nolte wins in a two-holiday - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated this, I would have to make nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he refused Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from third place to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and rode a bigger lead out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg/ Germany) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also earned his 22nd. Victory in production.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is travelling for Stuttgart, came to fifth place after second place before this time.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's women, Laura Nolte took the third victory of the season in the second boby on her home track.
After it was enough for fourth place the day before at the Monobob only, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday at the German triple success with slider Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to be done around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not completely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore I can't redeem it while I finally asked for it.
I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he had said that had very angry with me.
Look in the chat it went to the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I type it comes an extra field with the message
Was accepted by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged
And do not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe the one thing is possible - or others like that...
I'm 24th kPTBS, a full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has become a burn. Grades brought on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because there is a dressing hand in the asterisk.
It is also cooled down and we are currently less (1-2x week) which makes me very struggle with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child is just scarred, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the warmth lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is just gone for a month.
Now housework is also approaching us, which we naturally split up.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well prepared, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I can get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I did a written test for which I still did nix and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then it goes on?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do it...
Do you feel the same?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I cannot put into words.
Do not know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that some of them has to do with mental load of women, so I thought that I certainly find suffering here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have got today my order unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was just like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we now change the table, I get other color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.
Two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school at the time that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is only another subject for them, such as math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christianly and I have always believed somehow.
What do you stand by?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and or fellow students with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There are also no curriculum etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What does one want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Culture realize or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write English that I also understand well
That's been a long time, then I would refrain from doing so
Is good, thank you.
I expect a feedback promptly, at the latest, by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support ’NAME’.
Film search Help please
Hello dear guys,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (am 24).
I believe it has been a film for young people.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I cannot describe it anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Caribbean curse).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring woman to this kingdom in order to be able to live myself I mean.
The transition is I believe to be the soldier's grave.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this tells you something I am grateful for every answer.
Our little ones slept only on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child can withstand much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, often go in and look, but not minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it straighten something from the belly?
Or is it lying with the face ahead Directly in the mattress?
You can deduce if everything is fine.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was eg gang and given that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" at you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and I did not provide any feedback.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: 'ALPHANUMERIC-ID').
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I would ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at this time.
To put it very clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Only it is simply the fact that the politics of this station is now among all sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big bedding tour at the same time.
It was said that you were a "independent" Internet station.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "no running aquela column".
What is one now?
An 0815 promotional channel who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
They are of course valid for everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they may further insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rooms tries to make ashes.
How can you find all this well?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a return, because my delivered wooden table was switched defective.

Cherry kernel cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, since cherry stones can absorb warmth very well and release again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the kids feel secure, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry stone pillow with reference is suitable as a heat rest exclusively for the following areas of application:
Check for atypical smell, stick or burn spots before heating the cushion and dispose of immediately if there is a presence.
Please take the inner cushion out of the move in advance for heating!
In the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. Heat up 2 minutes (note the data of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then cover the inner cushion.
The first heating may lead to a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been covered back, please ensure the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) check on your crook!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, and in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours as well as pregnancy, please apply to a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores leaking, dispose of the product and loose seeds immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and ca. 3 years old) no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought power supply alone is also enough for operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop does not start despite the plugged-in power supply.
Then I have expanded the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Vllt do you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to send the PRS ORG to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the stool.
But do not know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold divider.
And whatever else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the messenger bags.
There is a metal closing hook in the closing flap with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various “fillers”: there are 4 anchor bars, stable riveted, in which the closing hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top beam, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can also be reliably closed without snatching in the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus store both separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things remain safe in the left side of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the emails from their support.
'NAME' yesterday emailed me from confirmation for the assignment of
Contact by the forwarding company announced for the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate resolution.
I am now writing with the third support employee, with none of me came further than the promise I receive as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom ’NAME’
It is foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening
hello, my order is 'NUMBER'. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I will place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year went differently than I could not suspect and could not fully fully observe and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the demands of the dynamic driver, which appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are peculiar to specific discs and samples.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the properties of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the pane, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of each car through an attractive and striking look.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ’49.
Thousands came from close and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country's wealth.
For many it was said: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for itself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, grow horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues so as not to go bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage with your resources and build a tableau that is more and more “work” for you.
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or create rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over 1849 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year when California achieved official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the map where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the right locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternately perform actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, positioning guns, positioning guns, and positioning gunshers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awarder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
This continues until the award has moved five times, so once every location has covered up and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end in the Graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final rating takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" document, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patients: who are entitled to raise serious charges against him.
​Please take care of you, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
It must never, never, never, never! to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as great as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still shake.
Holetschek: Countries seek to remove the test obligation for three-fold vaccinated
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide cessation of the test obligation for three-time vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test obligation can be omitted for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for three-fold vaccinated is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional insistence," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference on this coming Tuesday." afp
So I want to send back the lamp
What is the best way to do?
Hello, I think the 'PRS' chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer handle any purchases via my 'PRS'ORG.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Purchasing goes via the PRS ORG page on the computer.
I have updated account details.
What may be this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anaesthetic.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 to 1000 on.
The most common thing is to listen to noises/voices, less likely to see pictures and most rarest to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that go hand in hand with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anaesthetic is avoided to protect the child until they are cut off.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anaesthetic preliminary consultation.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment by me describes awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **per had none.
Have misread their comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective stool.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of e-commerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective stool.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some money.
I already sent you an email that you did not answer.
Again the question.
The order and on the invoice say that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is the company 'NAME'.
I was calling there.
I was told that they only were delivering to the front door - because of the 'PRS' ORG.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
am I not calling?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, drying up: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world that theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here my life thank you."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used primarily in Europe as a load carrier.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria data, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The value of production was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not collected

Rouladen tips & tricks
I had had many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I have come to the taste and would like to cook the first time roulae on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a cattle stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a oven, just a large pot.
What hencees will happen now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my PRS ORG?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
IEs goes to refund €NUMBER
I was informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund was made.
But to this day the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check this.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days such as the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You have not yet provided poultry?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and the fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and the crushing content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which can be used to reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it already happened that the POWER LEVEL controller can even quickly make a performance reserve if it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal adjusted here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or when directly recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also make a VFS5 foot switch, you can also easily call up the sounds on/off, switch the effect blocks on/off and "get down" the tempo of the resulting compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for the live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But this was seen by others.
Is it then possible to send the lamp back?
Since it depends on a dining table too low?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me?
And the chests of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've already sat on the PRS ORG chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the 'PRS' ORG mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deals
According to Iran, progress is being made in the negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that are supposed to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna news agency.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning it did not even have unity over the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement after almost one-week interruption were continued.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now a province of the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
The only state is the value above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was the corona incidence on Sunday above the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections were reported with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to infection within one day.
200 severely associated with COVID-19 sufferers were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, registrations may occur.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come after the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery is only made at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I need to print it out and stick it onto the package and hand it over to the post, that was it?
here I don't have to click/send/fill anything?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, so I am writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at your own expense.
In my view, 8 euro return fee is a cheek.
It's time for changes
"MBundestag me is greeted, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Where to go?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Federal Parliament parliament, you can see one thing: it is not extistent.
We got into a winter rigidity and extended the summer hole to several months.
"Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it?
For the most part, this is likely to be simply connected with dissatisfaction, as has happened here and how we generally outline.
In the last few days, the impression has been shown that many people are really lucky after the Federal Day.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Federal Parliament is required to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/deizZVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found a pile of shards that were said.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who would like to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to once again explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange ideas on each other, as well as work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Aim:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we look outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but what's not bad, we end up with the discord.
If you have pleasure and time, come to the discord, work with and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cloidal for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the NAME is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread 'PRS' ORG, is there any oversize, in 240/240 for example?
After all, I have to be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify how this can then work.
I can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for installation?
How long would I have time to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently probably eating meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without thinking.
And that I thought for a long time that I, as a vegetarian, would support animal welfare, but at some point reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal agology.
Hence my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, then she defended vegetarianism and told where her flesh come from and animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was to “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put into a corner as a vegan and conflicts arise without having to put it on it.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
This is not an exception under Section 312d BGB.
Do not release your 'PRS' hazardous to distance selling from the legal requirements.
I am at the assigned date at which PRS ORG does not pick up my return on site.
Since I cannot be on site because of a funeral, this cannot be changed.
Please can assign me an alternative pick-up date.
I am always found again from the 01.02. NUMBER.
Lahnsteiner weir prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from land
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant notice of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment car of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to Chief Mayor Peter Labonte in Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there are permanently expected to increase in operations: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure flow are helping to achieve this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
However, followed by their recommendations, have synced, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I am a little broken because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and hope for help now.
Okay, then it is.
I would want to order 3 items from the collection of 'PRS'ORG' to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar job, we were also arms carriers in the executive, furthermore I do not want to go into it!
The question of right and left is always very simplistic.
Basically, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
The fact that of course also in the special uniform and weapon wearers people to the right of conservative magical should also be clear to everyone, that these people can of course hardly cope with the lived reality is of course also clear, because of course you have not even less to tell even these people in the executive, now many Germans with a migration background, women and homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggerated klish gay now, but these are not less in the executive number they even even even these even if they are not less to these n many men in the executive than they are not less than even some things)I leave, because in doubt they save you your life or set it up for you.
But even if it is strange to my experience, even if it sounds like a conservative attitude to my experience, are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposedly committed to it or thinks it must please them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, there will also be extreme rights there, but that they are allowed to express their opinion there openly or even openly making any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who were often starting to generalize due to negative experiences, and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
Also it happens that certainly right-wing members meet who are engaged in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, something in my opinion is well combated and also counteracted with political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally embroiled and that is good so in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
yes, what I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
but I was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with 'NAME'.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other PRS basket for 'NUMBER' Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I can only find you as a partner company.
but on the top of the edge of the wood are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More ordinary by child?
Hello, me (w32) one thing has been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (am independent, very little free time), but already all my life I get it more badly than right to lead my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and put.
But it's actually never the way “someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere, but most of the time household simply loses against work and pain.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly because we are happy to cook.
Now, to my question, have you managed to become more neat with child?
We don't have one yet, but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for some time.
Because I have no incentive for me, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visit and e.g. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or remain slutty?
Rejoice me to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preform with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bending)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (arms, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforming in the lower back and in the crotch provide a tight, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar edge area increases the flexibility around the back zipper, thereby improving comfort, especially when bending over and when mounting and applying the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility when the arms and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft, collared zone improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by means of a flexible, gentle Velcro fastener, which does not adhere to the lamination or seams
Double sleeve with zipper on arm and ankle joints connect a coverable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load capacity when tightening.
Long zip at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush glued with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer collar lined for greater load capacity
Edges of the inner iconets notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist band computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been teaching for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering restarting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an self-secure (or. anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (ACPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have often been told that I had an aloof effect (although I believe has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("Although simplest things are backing") and it is hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know what it works in the meantime" / "I keep him off from the work with my stupid questions".
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to have mentioned it at the point.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do they mean by returning please !
If I have downloaded a book to the PRS ORG, the message will not reach the email addressing the book.
are there any problems?
I was in chatting with 'PRS' who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and in turn builds up its body's own proteins, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumages in the malting bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal associated with a particularly high strain.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curial administration of NEKTON-Bio, a daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (minerals).

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and water/food changes daily.
A deleted measuring spoon (infitting) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON organ.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the formation of plumage is visible.
The normal dose is then passed until the new plumage is fully complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse her, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to tell that my order has arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in the return to the statutory article
Hello/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Thus, application filed to the community.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I believe that is, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Severly road accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plößberg junction.
As the press alarm currently reports to the police (14:03), a car has come into oncoming traffic when overtaking.
There are injured.
Ah okay understand.
Good, then thank you many again, that it would be so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
Happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my prefers head shrink everything you can think down.
Before I go out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - that is, of you.
I'm taking the ref as a career changer.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with the teaching profession and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And there is only half a year around.
When painting before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still shift.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref. I always thought I would be stress resistant, but there was my weekend my weekend and after work my evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work did not matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is also going well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can stand before it makes completely closed - if it doesn't do it right now.
I wonder if I wanted to have the rest of my working life - just if I read some of the contributions from you here - or whether I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my time free time, when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and what worked together in a team and not as lone fighters like that now is the most time.
But then I wonder if I did not arrive at the same place in a year now and am dissatisfied.
You realize it's all somehow confused, but maybe you have come out as outsider advice or ideas, like how I get out of this situation, which I am completely finished and starting to cry at the slightest thought.
I will not make decisions so emotionally now, which probably does not lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me to come.
Thanks for reading and excuse the tearful undertone of mine.
I hope that my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continued to evolve, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state of the art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound the way you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 has once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists are looking for a maximum variety of sounds here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and string stop, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly depicts the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic Lose at Clippers
The Lost Series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually attachable Velcro closures, it depends on the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a attachment flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photo-related things.
Drone pilots also make the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Canary Islands in Spain since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa at 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to prognosis when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damage
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new headlands were formed off the coast by cold lava, a total of about 50 hectares.
The immensely important banana cultivation for the island, about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants, was particularly affected and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El Pais".
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about it combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giftgiving, so that the gesture of giftgiving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social treaty of natural peoples", which rigid routines escapes and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift giving.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into their windows for three women in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular custom in Germany emerged from filling the boots of children with gifts.
Protestants pushed themselves because they reject intermediaries between God and man as "veneration of the saint."
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of gift giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, only very few people are still annoyed that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martinssingen and Martins moves.
Today, everything your heart desires can be found in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought-after luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have been demonstrating a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift giving postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful cuddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Santa Claus, who were assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his white beard species, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian type of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by the reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain the Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy there is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia there was some fame for Father Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
An armed man was shot dead by the police near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police told callers had reported a man who is said to have gone to a bench and a bookmaker's business with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
Shots were killed and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume any terrorist background.
There are several messages in the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The luminaire is easily set up and can be anchored in the floor with 2 earth skewers.

In the Hollywood spectacle, they are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color within colour.
"Smart Stone" is very harmless, however: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or colourful light (in six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: this modern light object presents itself like a natural-formed large pebble during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also makes good himself in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself great preliminary work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require supply line or batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any place illuminated by the sun day.
Two earth skewers included provide a firm hold if required.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When twilight breaking, "Smart Stone" begins to shine automatically; in which colour, you determine yourself: six attractive light colours are available – besides daylight white.
The switch-off is also automatic as soon as the battery charge charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the next day.
That's what I have already done several times it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women's people,
I hope to do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I necessarily started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave it again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had received about two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it burdened me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two years break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this time.
Fragrance-free and without getting is already my cosmetics, but maybe there is something someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, a gynaecologist did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone: who has read the novel!
Yes Love Skin is so a thing.
Had pre-buperteated bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule sham and the acne theme.
I also have diet in the course of chr. Illness tries everything and got stuck on sugar, milk and meat arms mixed food, because otherwise nothing worked really well.
It can also be good that hormone is simply the worm in it, but if you have anywhere construction site you prefer to go neither more looking at what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.

110 kV Earth Cables will be newly built in 2022
The permission for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria paving the way for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometre long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt lead between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

All three other parcels have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the further process is like?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the entire sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is standing in my apartment and 'PRS' improves to come to the apartment because of the 'PRS' ORG regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to go into my home
Thank you for the news
but why only 20 EUR?
The value of the original value of this chair was NUMBER EUR
No, it is with all books, so the request is suitable for 'PRS' ORG, since it is probably a general problem
Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have great problems to plan my teaching in geography in a timely effective manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy B/F free of charge at school (which is annoying for Earth second).
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geospatialized factors and here every hour is actually standing for me.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for librarys, etc.).
I actually always go out of the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can help me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
Would make me really happy.
I would like to return the PRS ORG from the order 'NUMBER'.
I have actually already opted for a new one at 'PRS' ORG, however, I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Trading considers this to be unnecessary and deplores slumps in turnover.
He also has one possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business to retail.
HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth criticised the case of transactions with articles of non-daily demand.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the rest of the day of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive peak of the year is often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Accordingly, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost one third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It runs well only in the food retail and online sectors.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main manager.
"2G while shopping doesn't take us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staff deployment.
The ribbon regulation must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all transactions with the volume received on that day.
In addition, sample checks should be sufficient in retailers - as in public transport from the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - sample checks.
The property group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, with sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly be dropped in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the center is trying to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "for example, visitors can once provide their 2G detection at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed."
I recently ordered and delivered the PRS ORG.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame is also a bug that was tried to be laminated with a yellow filler.
It looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it to it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the luminaire to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, one of the memory buttons is simply used and done by pressing one longer.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is switched on again when switched on again - Very practical during studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is installed a battery tester equally installed - for each of the two battery compartments, a value in the two displays (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can go directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of a fixture on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included.
Great, this is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad I got as a gift and it is too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a comeback with a toasting comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in row Hessen allegedly found themselves on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcies.
But then the SBU turned up, shot the frustration over a mixed start of the season within a good hour and won the furterior of 5:2. "It's madness what the guys have done today," said coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "package praeeze, everyone who was there with you."
At the beginning, after another damper, the number of Frankfurt residents, which are now in number, were still looking to be short of their expectations.
Patrik Schick had taken the Leverkusener in the lead with 2:0.
What happened impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continues.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defensive defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old, looking ahead to the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself for the coming tasks, but also sees itself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all players have fit in December that all players are physically in a top contract.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and the tasks "persevere at this level" by the turn of the year.
Next, the programme is already on Wednesday in the course of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky).
I grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call and redirect it to PRS, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, for me, this would not be called me because it has already lasted a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the 'PRS'ORG chairs?
Shock absorbers for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women sneaked with hanging heads and empty views from the floor.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) scored a bitter defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and has now reached hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We need to look after Spain differently.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished mainstream group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a pity that we could not take the flow with us.
That was a bad game of everyone, which we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the semi-finals, the 2019 World Cup runner-up will have to increase significantly against the 2019 World Cup second party in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German launcher in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We simply were not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," said backroom player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We now have to quickly look ahead."
From front to rear not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament matches, the German team with the kick-off was not up.
Mischiefs and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only the essencewoman Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-fight.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
The German women could hardly put themselves in the spotlight against the aggressive covering of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
The game went early at the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get into play a little better and at least five goals came up until the break.
The already only quiet hope of a chase after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener procourses sedated in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to gain an increase in performance and went off the stage as a clear loser.

The title is previous, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is volactician vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon finished, they will continue in vaccination centres for me afterwards.
I am happy to answer questions without a temporal limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to one personally (e.g. "I take drug X, it is compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility, there is clarification for vaccination, indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccine order and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (never has happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but which cannot (only be allowed to do vaccinations, but only "only" (not lacking appreciation for God for the sake of God!), so that I also do the most vaccinations there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, heavy reflection has been provided for in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained inouncable by the callers.
No, it was not a "man nervous".
And no one, "to whom everything has to go fast".
That, the people heard about the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment with many upper palers.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wips out the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewing Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more known mundane word "Houdner".
Which gave an educational gap closed - probably also with many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy any books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message comes: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the PRS-ORG, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Choosing a tyre for racing bikes really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up with action because I wanted to train at least a little in the coming week to prepare my bike tour.
Said, done and I started with my road bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then this happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: Danke Krefeld!) lurks.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to take part in the rest of the route.
Since I didn't really have any chance of getting a replacement jacket and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again with a halfway bad mood and take the first track home.
Was then not quite as bad in terms of lunatics, maybe it is also better if I practice it again before the bike ride with the tyre change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of time, I would be extremely unwilling to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tyres from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike to demolished until 2 p.m. 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he rode on roll with them for more years.
But if I think that I still have to change the tyre when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unblivitful.
Now the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indet unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tyres now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I have on the road bike at the moment I think 25x622.
They are also available (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend me to other tyres on a road bike?
The Schwalbe page shines to my absolute! Lie knowledge rather recommended to the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and greetings!
Car throws against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his carriage against a central island and then hit the opposite lane, as the police said.

After the release of our new High End full range B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get young talent again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this building proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level is to be reached.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such an large sound pressure level almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it occurs remarkably adult and very impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was tuned the SOLO 15 with a slight rise to the high frequency.
This is commonly used for full range bands to optimize the too high frequencies of bundling.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the tone range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-suspicion of extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that looks for its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the loudspeaker in order to plan the corresponding changes during the construction.
For example, if you want to vene the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies again material.
After all the plates have been cut to cut (e.g. in the DIY store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the base plate at the appropriate point, so that the cable can easily be carried out there later.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
The back wall, lid, front and bottom are now glueed onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if one wants to fall back on finished strips from the DIY store instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front follow.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forestry drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the terminal clamp on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Then a round milling cutter is used to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
The base plate is then firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and unabridged cable is pushed through the 8 mm drill into the foot step by piece through the 8 mm drill to the terminal opening and leaves it there approx. 30 cm out.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is headed to the loudspeaker opening and let it hang it out loosely.
The frequency crossover is prepared and used below.
The following document can be found in the blueprint of the crossover as well as the corresponding connection diagram: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and thus close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be there by taking place, so we will watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it is still a pandemic – yet we will give it all to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Imagine drinks cold, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
