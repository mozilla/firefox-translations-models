Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal for Iran's nuclear program, which was promoted by Obama, has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was sometimes seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In a distress call, professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told police with a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that officers had to come to his home.
Lamb was keen to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police encircled him.
A day after the shooting at university that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm had told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would represent no guarantee for him for an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing campus, police later found Lamb's lead when he drove back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime girlfriends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
He was the woman crush at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no charter of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was in order.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago but had friends left and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
They later played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he Lamb and Prentiss Night at night 5. September saw for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial service on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm, in his distress call, referred to Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed at him a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to stores and distribution centers across the country. In the 2014 Christmas period, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The movie begins, and it comes to mind that I'm a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the greatest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in select cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent member nations - U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation inseparable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll ratings that show Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's perseverance and starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll ratings suggesting that the real estate mogul isn't just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers are holding up in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unhappy" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the nation's first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Even so, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temper doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
If they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll from last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change since when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the final cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Still, it is revealing that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change my mind.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've formed their minds are twice as likely to be for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they are aligned with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been linchpin in public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep crucial Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on issues of immigration.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do too.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson, meanwhile, account for around half of the support of Republican voters, largely from their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday poll they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry with Washington, too.
A poll by Des Moine's Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly upset."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea watt.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student stall in Munich is not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top places of residence, however, the price seems like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time top scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch's cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) deservedly with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on the 28. May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
Müller received at his 28. Goal in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership benevolent With the help of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let pass a shot of the world champion intended as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich forwards kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled here.
Yet Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They approached courageously, but often too unimaginatively in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by game shift to left-back Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against former Braunschweig's Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank from the right half field smashed in the left upper-goal corner.
In the 67. Minute the world champion awarded the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown struck the Pole's header from the line (26th).
Then by direct takedown, which goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35th).
Although Bayern raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put pinpricks.
Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliant.
For example, when he steered a shot from Ideye over the bar (56th).
Ahead of Neuer, Guardiola had a chain of four defending with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, said sports board member Matthias Sammer on "Sky": "Who wants to make something different out of it, that is already vicious".
Also on the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came on late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, with Müller putting another one on top of it by penalty.
Before the game, there had been riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly hooded Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported out of the stadium injured.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, you not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news is that if it waives, the risk quickly decreases.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is according to the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely, 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham in England.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous research has already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study backs up the findings.
Archaeologists come across remains from late antiquity on Cologne's banks of the Rhine
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always consulted as a specialist office for archaeological monument preservation.
In the third phase of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists have now found what they were looking for.
It has already been known from text documents that at the point in the 4. century a fortress and in the 8th. Century has confessed to a church, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman has died at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
Early on Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman from the direction of the station building crossed the tracks at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she has sustained the most serious injuries, according to federal police.
She was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital by emergency services.
The investigators have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman's nightly track crossing.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information that provides information about the cause of the accident can be given at the Federal Police hotline switched around the clock and free of charge by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is to create the world’s largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings specifically stipulate that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come equally from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is also planned for the first time.
would allow it to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings agreed among themselves on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to work towards an international investment court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS), which is mainly demanded by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, over which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, overturn national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
It was criticized above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged as a result, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be in place by the end of this year.
This appointment is no longer valid.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at Cologne's Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Steven's lecture.
Based on various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, which his meticulous and delicately arranged songs report on.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" cleverly composed songs appear, which snuggle harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a bold series: Each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens is performing here.
Live is enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a widely acclaimed masterpiece in 2005.
Exuberant in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual leaderboard of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes use of very extensive electronic offset pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and reverb.
Long since the smaller clubs descended, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark-held hamburger More!
Theater he mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests now sit in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays their way through the broadly enriched album.
You can hear from the audience: The lecture is "more opulent" and you can use it to "throw away the record basically".
First to an encore, Stevens thanks modestly, acoustically plays few older songs and finally bows out with roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and line up with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from close range.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Corbyn's leadership, for it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Labour's decision, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th, has. To remain an anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, provoke criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "been in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, referring to differences in economics, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
BBC Political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "piling up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's remarks on the position on the European Union and limiting on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is putting forward changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Shadow Labor and Pensions minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since becoming A Tory boss in the last decade across the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "stroking" and the quarrel with barbs and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economics minister will represent him if he doesn't attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought into the conversation the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theatre," which is often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he acknowledged that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow MPs, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless young people trained to be photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living with it.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in UK
The pound surged, according to data indicating a rise in the UK's wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the bidding target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest and provided assessments of the timing of an interest rate increase since 2009.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market, making a 20% jump after takeover offer from rival AB InBev was received.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the rival group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it was $2.5 billion. $ through a share sale as part of his strategy of debt cut.
The shares of packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its assessment for the firm Rating on "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The chief executive of JD Sports says higher wages put expansion at risk.
JD Sports' managing director Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer extra jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a hemp with an upper-chict frise.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: This is where her idol, whose posters hang in Szczecin, have been living since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs the same amount on the day as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to sit in high school in the 10th grade."
“I’m fulfilling a dream.”
Schooling?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Neither did Bieber himself.
He took care of anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl, he conceded three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company flushed many, many dollars to the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million like this.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others stress that Bieber is at number 1 in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least that's how he pretends.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato kebab idea
Potatoes or kebabs?
It goes both - and that's in the potato doner, which the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of kebab" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
He was inspired by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of kebabs", which he had seen on television by chance.
Since then, a barbecue skewer has been spinning in his shop, stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculturalism for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered the idea with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of internationals is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches down-to-earth campaign to combat Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earthness campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building up the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to have more details of its defense strategy on 29. September releases when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and appliances conducts its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store deals and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch away about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report released this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating revenue of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mostly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a Melbourne business lunch that Metcash is likely to be within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is expected that a board member of Metcash made contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food retailer, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label food.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will increase in vigor and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," came into the spotlight through Kyrgios' infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat the kid."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty excited about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was drawn into the dispute a little," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost in the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to have broken a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he's been treated a little too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room area, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term integral part."
"First of all, we wish the team was completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies all around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick very quickly made the climb, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the spotlight where he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the squad and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, withholds refugees
Hungary declares a state of emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining all those who tried to enter the country illegally. all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's-land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
Talks must take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border did not come a day after the 28-nation bloc at a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the surprised Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an early action by Brussels or from its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to cordon off roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the emergency state," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to procedurally agree to the deployment of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country national security adviser for Orban, said authorities 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing criminal offences under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and squeeze a crowd to push themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link from Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders ranks second, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, will receive support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of primaries, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say their opinion is certain which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but those protrusions have diminished.
Their support among the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit lead with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead at this group.
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially excited about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their front-runner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval of dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
With the vice president throwing potential for president into the balance, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be her second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead above Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is by far a second on this measurement, but the percentage that views him as the "most electable" has increased.
Still, on the question of what's more important with a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the primaries.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some key features among voters of their party's primaries.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best on the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him on that.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
With questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server continuing to be asked during his term as secretary of state, most Democratic voters of the primaries are content with their explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on her general opinions of Clinton, though 36 percent said her opinion of her had deteriorated even more.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have got worse.
Although Clinton is seen by her party's voters as honest and trustworthy, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also view Trump as unhonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush perform best in honesty.
A majority see Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson advances close to Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times' latest poll
The two candidates now account for half of the support of voters in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing hold
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support is growing by 23% in the latest CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has struck off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson is rising in the polls - he lands at 19% support with Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking ahead to a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach holidaymakers to find still warm water.
A swim in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: The water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is coming to 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood members charged with the death of a Baruch College newbie
Nearly two years after a student died during a harassing ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to walk towards a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, according to police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and Andy Meng, contact the Brotherhood's national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be resuscitated, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to his head, trunk and thigh.
“Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood’s harassment. At least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A county grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal association.
"We want to blame not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will also hold those accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership of the local group.
This is what will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the House will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will all last and how long it will last.
In particular, the story offers little guidance on the process for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike, and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets are responding.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have emphasized so fiercely that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated because of a rate hike.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money,"" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here's a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen over the last month, anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the influence isn't that dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be choked off 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what's happening after the Fed's rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has mostly been on the upside in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate hikes, quite flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis that Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the raise cycle and the yield is beginning to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is highly remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point with a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent only twice in the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question of "whether it's any different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a rate hike by the Fed all year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to the present have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, dwarfing pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report concluded.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession at the observed stage.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is pretty much similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/lowering in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields are falling immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to move closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, though "we're still cautious about expecting higher yields," Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
What's interesting, Jones thinks, markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have widened and volatility has risen - all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to respond exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the clients.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have averaged 5 percentage points on average for companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of parliament criticised the broadcaster for its "dumbing down"

He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "is changing" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament, increasing new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something that private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service radio station was "dumbing down" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appear to be The Brits just under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously called examples where you're actually just imitating what's already in the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and elucidation of the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and making music that's really unsurpassed.
"And Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works, I also really think is important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needed to be done to engage audiences than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport to step on the feet of the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22m.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in a special BBC way."
He added he wished the company would "find a hit out of our in-house stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday in November slowed spending
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
Yet experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures only indicated seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers started making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. B. at home on the sofa.
But now that's leveling out, and we'll possibly see growth diminish.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as one reason for the slackening sales.
Experts believe buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of shoppers gathered around their computers to make their bargains five times, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which shoppers battled each other because of bargains, could stop shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in crane accident - bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames collapse partly on the giant Saudi bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's large mosque.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the track to pay their respects when the dead's first embarked on their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the Holy Site, where just days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were cleared for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family's construction company because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have left the crane's arm standing when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report that detail, but said the company's leadership was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the large mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the hajj that is taking place later this month.
The bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on larger construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same sum to permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Brits increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been behind the increase
This causes 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen to be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Brits lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can deftly handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, these days you seem to be a minority.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the company's chief executive behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the hardware store chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices has now been outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B&Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men outweigh the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more strongly towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the choices about buying items by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also re-structed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has staffed exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the regional court of Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball runner-up Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to chief prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used funds from association accounts through which they were allowed to dispose in their functions in 2006 to 2011 for private purposes.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was eliminated by the presiding judge of the Senate of Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is due to be negotiated at a later date.
In response to the reproach of infidelity, the defence stated that the club had never incurred a property disadvantage.
The sports officials would have only charged expenses and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (rd. 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: are we continuing to run the club or do we lock up?" one of the defendants told, in the bread profession large-scale auditor of the tax office.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We put money up, put our life insurance policies down as collateral at the bank," he said at the hearing.
It was agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
Furthermore, if appropriate financial, success was decided to pay the expenses compensation retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the expense compensation was paid out only years later, namely from the year 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and non-detail debits also appeared, the former chairman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the financial security in detail, only the debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When investigations for abuse of office began in 2011 against the one functionary, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer to this for a long time.
Then he finally said he thought that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage indemnity."
Why compensation?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all off the hook with that."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only charged mileage money and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not show exact documents for the early years.
These had not been kept after a business audit in which everything had been judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage money.
All the fixes were made in cash, for this he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will be held on 23. continued September with questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reductions that have been running for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs in the company's split.
The job cuts at US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) find no end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group is planning to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This is expected to cost 2.7 billion Dollars (2.4 billion Euro) will be saved, the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will become a special charge of around 2.7 billion. Leading dollars that will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
After-hours, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 percent.
The company from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up with printers: the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have recently put the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third fiscal quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers declined by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion. Dollar.
This caused revenues to decline in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans include the total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority support the anti-IS training mission

24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent could not decide.

Röszke: Outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the police stood a water cannon ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials.
The officers initially used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
With that, the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat, waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half, who were still in the view last week that the Fed would do so, now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero range and launch a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior staffer at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
She has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
Death gunman at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" in the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at around 10:00 on Monday morning
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center employee that police had to send police officers to his home.
He said "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house but who "will not bother anyone," but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "devastated."
He said that Prentiss were her daughter's "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been meeting with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life slack on the university's website indicates.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure all of this is taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa to rebuild the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the approximately 1000 executives worldwide will cost the group conversion the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is reorganizing its corporate structure and is upgrading the low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is a contribution to earnings of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a board member for passenger business at Lufthansa in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team led by CEO Carsten Spohr.
With the realignment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120 000 employee company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilots' association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to resume after the court-halftened strike this Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
The topic of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve "in a year with a projected record result" as quickly as possible to achieve sustainable results.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource routes to the Group’s own low-cost line Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-back cry and will rule him out of playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal isn't giving up hope Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th. Minute caused after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow, or maybe a day later, and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he's not going to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has an extra incentive to recover by next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When a player leaves the pitch with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard on himself because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball heading in a different direction so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's one thing all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message we've missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's plot, instead reproduces a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is ravaged by the money-greedy, tree-sleeping, Thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, mustache-like creature "who speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was delivered by Cameron's staff but gave no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's squad, but it's still hard
To come across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad England have chosen for the Tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won't carry scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali evolves as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at Test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth is out of the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he hopefully knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man in particular.
The question of how much time a Test bat will receive to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only accusation one can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in peak form - but that lost chance now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitter I value high.
He's an X-factor cricketer, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us a lot.
He must be given at least the same chances as before him, but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, emerged, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batsman can't beat there, and that left-hander has already shown he's a devil guy of cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a No. 3 for her, and there's not much difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests on the first drop before performing as an opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari is coming into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has impressed me a lot as a young man.
People may look at his stats - average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there aren't a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the squad, England have made a few smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful effort into the setup.
I've always felt he's created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what's been said before.
Colly's team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, isn't used at the one-dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team presenters do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily on a heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU) could gain traction if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's unsophisticated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to lead Labour or the TUC, which fiercely quarreled over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is, and not always out of their own fault, are full of Britain's self-created agenda with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they mostly do not want to.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it did not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain looking outside inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - and lets it see through that more and more short-sighted ministers and civil servants in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
Germany's cautiously calm Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overly long-standing ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a leftist.
It's hard to imagine that they will tear themselves out a leg to help the selfie-Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense, and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, as they were during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You may weakly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo of non-inlanders who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum swirl, because Blair had put the principle above the EU's unpassed constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who thus opened a backdoor for him.
The press has never forgiven him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he has to come up with a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I put it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-dye tendency and the wilder climes of Tory's Little-Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not Benn" Benn on radio and on television this week, when the Boy Scout struggled in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father on television struggled to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contestants and MPs after all the reports at their closing session on Monday night.
Whatever Corbyn's touchy bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the swirl of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities on EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is rock-solidly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, when this can all be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principle Report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
Yet some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" at which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental public health principle is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people conscripted to develop a model for a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references on public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said it was receiving funds from an e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he is said to have received after reports previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the panel's members are not delivered, but that includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco management.
The group's research work "significantly confesses" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products at most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims have already been responded to before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but that we continue to have the long-term effects to study.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion. £a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief executive
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs likely seen by a smaller audience into hard-controvertised windows of opportunity against their rivals' most popular shows and by broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC director-general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or broadcasts programmes that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the Upper House communications committee as part of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others don't do or commission.
They are sending The Voice in a world-class window of opportunity because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funding programs that could also be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their duties, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all of these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window of opportunity where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think you get a big value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example from public television stations in Australia and Canada to "inform, educate and entertain" this in "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, which he said only a handful are shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the changed motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Watch Trade Show Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle smashing leg cuffs!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to put the British government's readiness to move guns to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and that require a second look.
“Important announcement: Drive from 15 to 18. September with DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving with DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London, using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys claimed to gain "access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trading posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works nonprofitly with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that reigned around advertising for the Arms Fair - through a vacancy of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady company advertisement, but "by inflating with bright colors and animation, it remains more strongly liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the field within ExCeL, where exhibitors are spending fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab discloses an order from the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student dorms
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student dormitory, still in faith in Beret's and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous, long-breathed complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student dormitories ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to chat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you've taken sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes caught fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and community meeting places, but they're also the places where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't Think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-room strolling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I've used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by socializing - and send him a text message instead of knocking on him.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you start university at the height of the baking mania, knocking on the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less odd than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you a little bit. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to converse and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to stand up to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this out with the milk owner.
Chances are they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
When someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a dishwashing liquid to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you literally belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could mind to turn Drum & Bass down a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded to it with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5am, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she let her own music blaring, shut down her door and embarked on her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same dorm?
Conversely, it wouldn’t be abysmal embarrassing if you have to keep a roommate for your future spouse, get close to her, separate again, and then see her every day, and perhaps witness her pulling all the mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your abdomen a little sanity.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never snout someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not staple their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the middle Franconian town of Eckental for people who do not have a lot of money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing space, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created: He builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, excluding land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the building codes complicated their plans?
Gildner: I went through my project correctly under construction law.
The looming sword of Damocles special construction and the parking space regulation are always particularly complicated.
Scary.
It is still assumed that whoever manages three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is there a lack of space.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did local residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True: We have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
When it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some encountered problems after installation because they get an error message that indicates that the "software update failed."
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made that less likely by sloring the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a termination of the update.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves in case they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton only one motto: "Full attack".
The World Cup second-place finisher emphasized before the start of the decisive seven overseas races "that I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the runner-up before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and also tackles the floodlight Grand Prix in the city-state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will have influence on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1. Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wants membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Red-White" to be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quarters office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have teamed up under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation is pulling it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, seniors and advice seekers now receive information on questions such as long-term care insurance or health and care insurance companies.
For years, we have found with our outpatient nursing service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Nor are many services of the cash registers rarely used, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as the outpatient service "Amadeus" as a business unit manager.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, you can take advantage of additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehab.
"The senior center for care and care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre, particularly in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to isolation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6. October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division Würzburger Kickers had not yet been determined due to renovation work on the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th October as the date.
The encounter of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the quarter-finals of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third division FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively scheduled.
It will be played on Tuesday, the 6. October, at 19. Clock in Bamberg's Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will take place, now we have planning certainty," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket pre-sale that has now started.
It is special for our team to play against a third division team.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight games have a special charm.
FC Eintracht Bamberg moved into the round of the last 16 teams in 2010 by victories at the District League 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2) in.
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Defending champion is third-tier relegated SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, has died.
He died on 5. September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th. century in Vienna," as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in Vienna’s Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has noticed unwell in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is engaged, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not increase.
Wiese had his hair cut in Bremen city centre when he saw a parking space guard issue a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw the fine due at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," the city of Bremen said.
Only after that will it be decided whether Wiese is displayed or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the prosperity of the marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama's authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at around 23.45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to the police, and called to them that they might wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft petrol station.
Three people were also on the premises of the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the youngster and slapped him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and bleed heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and talked to the thug, he first let go of his victim.
The injured young man has now been brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racket and another male person.
With the help of a baton, they beat the victim's face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 metres tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 metres tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-and-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to come forward by calling 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The mayor of the municipality, Bernd Bormann, business developmentist Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf’s mayor Heinfried Kabbert, are also pleased about this.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: There Dr. Frank Müller on 1. October the practice Felstehausen.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will still be at his side with half a job in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller will open the practice on the 12th. October again, until then he is investing 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll got to know, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden hospital and also wants to join the practice next year.
"We've always had in mind that the Müllers would fit in well with this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it happened, I just called her.”
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years.”
He also sees as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time family man Frank Müller also grew up there, followed by his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and volunteers in the DRC-readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From the 19th September is being prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"The endoscopy is coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a consultation room more.
In addition, the IT is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the velvet municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continuing," emphasizes velvet community mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in the average North German practice it is about 500.
There is another family doctor's office in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
If you visit Müller’s consultation, you will continue to look into familiar faces: take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls with a chuckle.
She already feels a little wistfulness after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many more often," says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6000-square-foot plot."
“So far I’ve always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different.”
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also be ramped up at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this a matter of course.
The care and safety of people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear "that it needs clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept limitless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers 'corridor' - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously said that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to Austria and Germany to continue and possibly also to build corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see this in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, as the external border of the Schengen area, is already heavily controlled.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to seal off its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member has to fulfil their obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to enter Eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid in order to avoid the registration.
Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was the people to instruct certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected in the course of the day.
Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary was shutting down, so the police told us to drive here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to a slightly further west route to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive opportunities for border control."
They carry out strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and the EU partners have since consistently given the country a good certificate as far as the standard of border controls is concerned.
On the Serbian side, there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local appearance in Horgos: He considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be very high refugee numbers at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, there are still not cleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent in the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who are accused of having repeatedly gained insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information captured is said to have used insider dealings in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were won.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders will ultimately be caught," the SEC statement said.
The trials of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Assistance Mannheim has existed for 20 years
There is a lot of activity around Mannheim’s Paradeplatz.
People do their errands, sometimes fast pace, sometimes strolling comfortably.
They head to the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Home rails.
Pulsating, blazing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the headline "Before I want to die"...
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Relief drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the middle of the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some passer-by spontaneously reaches for the chalk and adds the sentence to "behavior my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stop briefly, read, say sentences like "I am not yet so far" and then continue.
Again and again, small discussions about the action itself develop on the margins, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this publicity action to the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still fraught with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement has contributed a lot in recent years to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was looking for volunteers by appeal, she immediately contacted and was present at the time of its foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompanies those affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Sankt Vincent hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences made.
"I see life from a different point of view, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training courses are offered every two years for new employees.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the final quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The firm also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. said it was making a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the earlier forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, which average 4.9 percent and on the 4th. January will take effect and despite higher surcharges for ground transports of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said it nevertheless expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost-cutting, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "produces solid returns when considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which at 31. August ended, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which caused sales in its Express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transportation rose 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell because of higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high at the 11th. June.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the ornate, two-storey boardroom is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The central bank has a twofold order from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned off by the unprecedented incentive from the near-to-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most of the economy's data shows it's growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to step up that volatility by raising the rate on federal bonds - and even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they are observing," Lindsey M said. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, what in itself unsettles the financial market.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator that only shows a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a drop in the stock market in case the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The action was sparked by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to lift the sentences at this point," he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the U.S.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, improvement in the labor market this year has been solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrugged late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the reins in this session," Stephen D said. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to better handle the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint of the then-head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "constrict" its monetary expansion, sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives may be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited discernible impact on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, Adam S said. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate fixing committee.
The recent turmoil is not coming close to that level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should rush ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even an auto section if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is located near the cash registers and has various takeaway options.
What's there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig natural bowel, fishballs, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping trolleys and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the till.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own park area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who support asylum seekers in the city unselfishly.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 Lenzen, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seekers' home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different teaching than at a proper school.
Brazil's pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. She does this with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies' genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernried sports ground is progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the drafted construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the panel had decided, among other things, a request for a building law "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with non-center first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This gives us a wonderfully large south roof together," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof pitch, which should be below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike prescribed in the development plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "liberation" became necessary because the development plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roof inclination - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, gymnasium construction is not a recurring project: "We do not set a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The gymnastics building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are included in costs.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports funding.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36-meter hall will now be submitted to the district office for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which district councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision on this is made by the Supervisory Board, and it will meet next Wednesday, 23. September.
Should the plans be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are there.
Employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should succeed him, the name "Fischer" came into play, according to Jochner-Weiß, who agreed to, from 1. To take over the management of October and to move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this would in any case mean an "upgrading" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", so Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases on the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until next year, the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing renovation at the Weilheim hospital is completed.
District Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairwoman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I'm ruling that out." Jochner-Weiß could not say how the property will continue, that there were several considerations.
Currently, a short-term care of Caritas and a day psychiatry are housed there.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the quasi-move to the Lech, which had been taken "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house, where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades, departments were closed, for example, the surgery and the obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (20.15) at Bergisches HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting accident involving two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by gunfire during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a corn field near Pratau (district of Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police announced.
After a gunshot, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could have come to the accident was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led police to the body of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youths and thrown their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A missing since Saturday 16-Year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body, is considered suspect.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after failing to come home as agreed the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, investigators initially came across personal belongings of the victim.
During questioning in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-old finally arose.
The alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested admitted in the police interrogation, the 16-year-old killed and the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to be brought before the arrest judge on Wednesday, investigators charge him manslaughter.
Information on the circumstances of the crime should bring the further investigation.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study on behalf of the association alliance "Social Housing".
By way of comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live in an initial reception accommodation than asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also accounts for significant omissions in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is getting bigger from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units have already been missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore necessarily lived in shared rooms in large cities.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slump in the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a fresh start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing again.
Thus, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be stepped up.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is virtually no getting through to Hungary anymore, as more and more refugees are choosing the way via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant passage via Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian interior minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set out for Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees the day before.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic declared: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, it's women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
They are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighboring country Croatia in the morning.
Most of them were reportedly from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus as well as taxis.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip poses other dangers for this: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine cleaners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people apprehended.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all - 93 - of which Röszke were most important.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "Transitzone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in recent weeks.
Barrier grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria is still reaching only a few refugees.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
According to government figures, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove 'stranded' across border
"We were busy cleaning up after Sunday's bridge festival, when suddenly ten people with travel suitcases stood at the entrance to the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the nearby Passau.
Before that, we have tasted the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We said we were going to take them by car to Passau.
"That was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN talk.
They were very grateful.
A man did not let it take him to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased with that," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, to try it after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped, but still across the border.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally very popular.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociably, the day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to establish structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has placed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the haze of National Socialism, highly officially and publicly.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees, too, will have to find that the "promised country" she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for people seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the first reception centre Traiskirchen has already been dealt with by Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also without much whirlwind, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Home Office, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in this year.
To meet the number, 35,000 shelters still need to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the state governors.
These would have assured him that he would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," Ferry Maier said.
The former VP mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, in which it will be clarified how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarter transmitters have to comply with a certain height of the towel rails or size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
Konrad explains with his experience that he is more successful in accommodation in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior.
I am an older gentleman who is not easily told the untruth in his face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The own neighborhood search was not yet successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is currently not necessary, because you can currently accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In case of an emergency, however, further locations are to be checked for their suitability.
The city chief criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be sealed off"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state governor Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday accorded the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
For the time being, there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the people seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU member states.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing checks again at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the Germans' approach.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer Industriezeile has been officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T chief executive Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested €1.7 million in the site, €3.3 million from the Techcenter, which is owned by a third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade: After all, she has now grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, in which she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and robes of various manufacturers, among other things, is now all about women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time whether to open another shop," says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area to sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put Breit in the cradle by her mother.
I’m most good when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get in rapture at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the specialist can not answer with last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances any outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called show-offs.
This characteristic also connects some with the billionaire, who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upsets.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, approaches journalists rudely or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office vigorously stirs up the election campaign.
And cut off well in the process.
This is also registered in the Palatinate city of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a household name for many in the wine-growing village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is related to him over -zidzy corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstadt woman Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which includes the Heinz ketchup family in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to speak in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt.
To the King of Hearts he did not bring it there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also the opinion that Trump is "already a bit a big mouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity was "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of show-offs.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the US.
The real estate company's cornerstone was initial land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not take Trump because he had once run away without authorization, had declared the director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, to the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken derogatoryly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as he's bulging, that's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so effervescent."
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
“He never took care of Kallstadt.”
Pensioner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadters, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She would like it better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge in the USA at the time of his grandfather were like him, "he would never have arrived there at all."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
“The grapes will be ripe even without President Trump.”
Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12 000 moviegoers, and interest is also awakening in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineeer village".
From the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountaineeeing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineeer village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberals' leadership, but it has not made any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show aired by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That drawback of the gap didn't seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers at the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell short of that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, 14. September 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily hitting The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two by The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5:30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour scored 520,000 spectators and a whopping 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot-seat an average of 620,000.
The drop in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to outdo the McGuires show.

The last three match: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he vote for?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly apparently who wins The Bachelor.
The woman at whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three turn out to turn out two, you may have accidentally given a clue to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's final
All three women have lyrically left out why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitudes as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", her answers could become the spoiler of who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - named Mackay as best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, that's when I felt they were pretty compatible, and I've thought that throughout the course of the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly set for him," she said.
And when asked who Wood should vote for, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will air on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed keen interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were plenty of other teams that sent inquiries after its impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scuffle the way the Aussie-Rugby league convert did in his first punt return on Tuesday in the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show off his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his blundered catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne crashes at a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game, posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian tarmac by gun violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized and his democratic efforts stopped.
The free voters are calling for the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn exam in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
“Otherwise we will get fault lines in the Bavarian education system.”
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voters' Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as it did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"This is not how it goes on, we have to get to the causes," the Free Voters leader said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
That's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW boss criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
“Bavaria is pushing off, others are not.”
“We need to be more capable of acting.”
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A years-long long-time hit remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "Middle School plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the secondary school from three to four years is tested - as a result, it will then again take nine years until the Abitur.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want this.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence broke out Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing rocks and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot them in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers this week voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could take effect on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of around 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
You wait for appropriate offers, it is said on the part of the city.
Which investor is eligible is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The planning for the holiday home settlement on the Kleiner Meer near Emden is taking shape.
The investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time.
Several residents are further worried - they fear the sell-off of their leisure refuge
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, brooded, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends from the system construction management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among sea stall owners who had come into the meeting evoked the images and new details on the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea stall owner and board member at the advocacy of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that towers over all other buildings".
In addition, like several other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads come, so that this pays off," says Schulz
What exactly happens on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First, we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring at gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to offspring at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as Mother Dian has so far kept her close to her body.
At first, the "Bild" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a wide gravure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, about in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark train and bus rides, as did hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately seeking help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally raised donations will double up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
It is too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," Dr. said. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries to treat type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain level of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained roughly the same at 29 in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% had diabetes completely and partially resolved the diabetes in 36%.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was completely only solved in one percent and in some cases only about two percent.
In addition, the results were "generally better in the 'surgical' group" in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1% and more likely to record a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%.
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people who underwent obesity surgery - compared to a group that sought more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have their bodies firmly linked to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving increasing attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel is probably especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it takes place in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not appropriate to the situation.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create a real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the 11th terrorist attack. September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US entailed a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the 11th September I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has provoked unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in child hand sanitizer intake in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, increased cases of revenue from hand sanitizers in children under 12 years of age who report poison control centers, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to go in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectants on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in young children, even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas hospital, the Fox 4 broadcaster in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whisky standing around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when kids get to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of hand sanitizer scented after strawberry at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah stalled her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had bumped her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizers out of the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York state planned to poison their "common" teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned her from her room.
Police viewed the thwarted plan as "chatter" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the crossbar between Nordring and Auf Herdenenen, a 33-year-old motorist was slightly injured in a rear-end collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the roundabout industrial area and perceived too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he bounced his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed that vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front.
Property damage to the vehicles involved in the accident amounted to about 10 000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed away.
Rumour mill: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths downplays the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad spot, but that he will turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA over accusation by Neilson and Warburton will be cautious on January re-commitments that could destroy squad's unity
Dons raise lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty kick in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths. This insisted that he and his team-mates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader of the standings.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national team player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in the old-firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to watch these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new additions, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The ex-chief executive of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, in talks with Celtic during the transfer period, has hinted he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a chore for two years with an annoying ankle and has failed to make the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later lifted - the third red card from Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on any performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible hibee was rebuked after he admitted singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened at a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn area outside an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but confesses that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're going to get the guys back on their toes," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to "win unsightly" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen squad desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win that earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup matches or leagues that have not won games of this kind either."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it rises overall in the UK.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the period May to July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of workers now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: "The government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunks disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officers take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test revealed 0.89 per thousand in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per thousand and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it emotionlessly.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he pleases, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the movement's public relations work will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the offence.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for it.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after damp police chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang out police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy water, just metres away from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a house peacebreaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too thrilled to get his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria's stewards and integrity department, claiming they were running a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it "looked like grapes hanging too high."
"I wasn't planning to say anything about it, and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start to think I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had let the bomb go off in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly grab their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, formerly. Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that lead me to the view that it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blames people outside of coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and cast me out of it, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is making them think about it now.
But I've now got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I'm going to put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his licence over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, which was the case.
But it also had it that way on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend following a clash with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was admitted by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver flight and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital. It is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals over claims to wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackle as an "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his squad scored the final win against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his squad's tackle, saying they were focused only on their "contact" when tackled.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his squad is confident to him as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that's what the turnaround has yielded for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great squad to coach. He's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always appears at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George being criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of it a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially its young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roosters scored a higher result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points anything exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at a stage.
The Storm team has free rein this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-finals at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants in the marina over the course of the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence he was trying to own the entire crowd and that in the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 bail as collateral to achieve his release.
"After reading the two individuals' affidavits, it is clear that the condition of a $200,000 security puts a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic has been released on bail, in conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and abide by a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab tears apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a rear-end collision involving three trucks on Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to dodge to the left at the last moment, the police announced.
The cab of the accident causer tore completely apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital seriously injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.m.
This resulted in damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as this one was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms for searching for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he had done it as it would "lead to paedophiles on the internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said it was an addiction -- that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said that he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment, indecent images of children on 14. To have taken in June last year, on the 25. January this year to have violated the conditions and not in court for a hearing on 24. to have appeared March of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers dodge small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are being apprehended away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, for fear of discovery and arrest, left people increasingly at smaller border crossings
out on the Austrian side, a spokesman for the federal police said.
More than 1000 refugees have been apprehended in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
According to Federal police data, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station compared to the start of the week on Wednesday.
Around 700 people had arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of checks on the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday in 1759.
Stuttgart: Forerunners of Tropical Storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the Southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The strong low is the foothills of Tropical Storm "Henry", which has moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour are to be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again for longer.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the car manufacturers at the IAA show their new products.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Audience Days 17 to 27. September) again.
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new luxury and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest firsts for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
So that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive for it.
Opel is promising an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring of the Kombi, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And what else is being driven up on new compact cars in addition to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version.
He will be on sale early next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New to the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The sales of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not brand new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot put on the front part of the hand: here the radiator grille was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, the IAA will feature a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has righted an ex-detainee of the Tegel correctional facility, which was housed in a cell that was too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were only locked up for a few days in the too narrow spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-detainee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the correctional facility Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who is now back on the loose, according to his lawyer, had been moved to a larger cell.
His official liability action for the unworthy prison conditions against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges overturned the ruling of the Berlin Court of Appeal and dismissed the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention days were decisive for the compensation from the period in question, a compensation claim was given, it said.
Otherwise, "a stunting of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the monetary compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they did not award damages to a prisoner until April because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humane.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The then plaintiff was housed in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
Berlin prisons had also hit the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 positions in Tegel are not filled because of the lack of young talent, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is coming to Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it".
The following overview conveys what is coming to Germany.
According to various forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is being built so far (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is particularly dramatic in affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social housing units fall out of the fixed rent price every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Minister of construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80 000 social housing units per year would have to be created and for this the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, it can be assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: from the work ban for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement that restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority of the view prevailed, also because of the shortage of skilled workers, that refugees should be given access to the labour market more quickly.
A major hurdle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient range of general and job-related language courses.
Research also shows that workplaces are most often taught through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the construction of networks is therefore the royal road to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to daycare centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the daycare center, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the need for educators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated their studies - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance.
Students’ refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
This is because refugees with a residence permit or toleration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act when they start their studies.
The latter generally do not receive a bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the child.
Tolerated refugees have so far lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from the 1. January 2016 on, this range is shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
The rights include duties as well.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain possibilities of control.
This includes the willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested translating the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration will be much more and more an issue for society in the future than it is today.
This will also have to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade, as a result of European decisions.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention Germany have to commit, must become a reality in the next few years, if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says President of the Doctor Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man- power and capacity, we can do that," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money must flow into the system.
To avoid shortages, Montgomery is calling for all arrivals to be handed over health cards right at registration.
Services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to dissipate so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for by the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the doctors above all make the language barriers to create.
The Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has already proven that migrants are being informed worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor’s offices, interpreting costs would have to be covered, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency outpatient clinics.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and the young people are concerned with HIV education.
With the partly different clinical pictures, however, German doctors would cope from their training, says Montgomery.
“Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to detect.” And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and several refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
According to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives in Germany in a traumatized manner.
Those who have contracted post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart racing and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe terrifyingness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, explained Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social welfare offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social welfare offices, mostly clerks or doctors who are not trained for the mental illnesses would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick wash.
“Our passion is the circus.”
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current manegen staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to get people away from their daily grind and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Manegen cocktail with cosmopolitan flair," is what director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to easily record it.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to take women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salvos, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with sensitivity and jointness.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people are fascinated and terrified at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinates with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst, insists.
Maladministration in the husbandry of circus animals is all too often an issue at various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not doing well".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
If possible, the "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, every wish is read from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go into the manege.
The top priority: to provide well for the animals.
Specifically dedicated to her Zebroid Jumbo, a blend of a ShetlandPony Stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte tells Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the crowd, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our hearts".
The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20. September daily at 17 and 20 o'clock to his performances.
On Sunday, the program will begin at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 p.m., the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest guide, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread via social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with booing calls.
Last month, they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesperson Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their cellphones that warned them about, Mr. Mugabe's speech to disturb.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death,'" he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected members of parliament that immunity in parliament ends, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later split into two publicly traded companies this year, separating the computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who is scheduled to lead the unit after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $year revenue and "will be focused on providing previously unmatched, integrated technology solutions to businesses," according to a statement from the company.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the move away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies deliver better performance.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss out on at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then found his way back to his old momentum during pre-season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd's investigation has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He has also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08, which have the most injury days to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rate will continue during last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of Saturday's games and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is setting himself a rotation inside the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it to have a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League captulation against Monaco and remain driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar depictions in shows is evident, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more likely to be in men than women.
In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign Against a Pathetic Life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the centerpiece of fighting to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication conducted through social media, with its emphasis on style about substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more profoundly.
And as one video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back on fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone chaplaincy employee explained it to me, "my listening role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I'm getting along with it" has a tremendous impact, like the feeling that it's perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.

Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria scores on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, helping PSG move past Malmö.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player who put the French champions on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st. Minute a header goal scored.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they not only aim for qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game from Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with whom he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“That’s a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score another goal or two more."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes that could hold a 2:2 draw on his own pitch against Bordeaux in the First Division at the weekend, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger has been called the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran in Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmö defence before finishing past Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would score a big win, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that level, competed in kick-off with nine national players on the field and was a tough opponent lined up with a five-man defense and two deep in midfield.
But except for a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, the wide on Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th. Minute passed, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG themselves sometimes gave up, with some mispasses and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who pitched in no fewer than five tries alone in the first half and was then given up after Cavani had deployed him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a spin, which from Wiland in the 52. Minute was steered past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had fished up a left flank from Maxwell.
That ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was stripped of a goal at the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying matches are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by slumping commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a share sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price in trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion in debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar

The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberespionage by China and its increasing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
Bayern were obviously on the verge of signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, once world champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already facing the departure from Barcelona before the Euro 2008.
“I was told that Barça wanted to sell me.”
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't do anything," he recounts.
FC Bayern also registered this.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
“Rummenigge wanted me.”
As a reminder, in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
The change did not come about, however.
And the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion today: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
“Pep told me that I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
“He got me with that.”
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf, knocked out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the premier class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor Brown interrupted when she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, namely in relation to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"If we're talking about diversity, then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted in shock, with offended disbelief and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the actor's comments of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to urge people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of the Harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black person, and she is a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
Dear White People's producer campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon retorted that their director "could end up giving us something we don't want to do."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to put a stop to discriminatory practices against colored.
In February, singer Prince made a nod to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, even albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are invited to visit the pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator helper Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show that just made its 7. Season finished, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock at winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E said! over his pile of money.
So suddenly .. like I can't even imagine what that's like... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, despite being the first to finish the course, doesn't receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it's given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, it receives the great gratification.
I don't think he has any grudges about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to rise within a half-game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to pin down over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and therefore I want to go into the game quite focused.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he's been four hits against the Seattle Mariners on the 6th. July had.
"He swung the potholz well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (stroke training), looked significantly better in the bullping, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy ran over Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie hitman Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading in the Major League 27. Once this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer managed an RBI double against the Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon, scoring the stand of 5-4.
However, the right-hander stabbed Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a not yet mobile Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been dropped from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back ailment.
"Obviously not the beginning I wished for," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I got going and felt I was going to create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they received the lead-off batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who managed a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 winning streak with the Runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers gained in the second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't do particularly well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, not scoring points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez retired because of an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He's going to be by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007, is investigating.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is dropped from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 on four starts with the Tigers since he has been in exchange with LHP David Price on 30. July was acquired
He's had since the 20. August lacking because of a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They are then to be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government headquarters responsible for the initial admission of Gießen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away."
Four years ago, it was glad that the chalice of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controlled on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced checks at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television channel ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
Asked about an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks in this regard between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
EU interior ministers want to meet next Tuesday (22. September) at a special meeting, take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong number of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to support the federal states more in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers in the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who need protection would also get it.
But those who do not have a prospect of staying can not stay in Germany.
This view was clearly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now manage a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia during the night to Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal off the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking evasive routes via Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were initial arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Spacecraft "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice sheet of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean is swedding.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini".
The moon is slightly tumbling on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too large for a consistently solid celestial body, according to a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca (U.S. state of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
In 2006, for example, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed Saturn’s so-called E-ring.
At least at the South Pole, there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to do without offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation had revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, said the club.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced break."
“This is hard for us, Rama is a bitter loss.”
"Of course we have to think now," sporting director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a clubless professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills."
Goal chaser Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is to enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to your slim line, you are often advised by them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy anyway: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, the immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
However, a mango also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is hiring up to 95000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers in particular are sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95000 temporary workers for the holiday season.
Faced with booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements early since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
The coming night, the Foehn breaks through in the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night on Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the foehn valleys.
After blow-drying on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a note, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area above the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys during the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the hairdryer blows until Thursday morning in the foehn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland in places, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture begins to accumulate on the southern slope of the Alps.
This is where rain sets in, which will last until Thursday evening.
In total, more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the hairdryer runs out of air, as a result, a cold front with strong, partly thundery interspersed rains from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures are declining significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, however, it will be sunny and warmer on weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome, right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of popes, as a minority, could often only live their faith in secret for centuries.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He found the city to be a depraved sin-babel.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colorful colours and imaginative forms - which, however, is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can look quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result is cycles that are dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Fathers.
He spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"That's when the education happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to work this up to perhaps get along with the Father again.”
His second concern is to help art to become more important again in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today, and this is loud.
Symbolism is supplanted there.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this regard, I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the pictures, let them affect them, discover and feel what power they have: "The picture seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take care to fully grasp the Bible, but to chose the topics that were important to him, also mysterious.
"This was not cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains". The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will take place on the 15th. November is opened in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX railway is approaching
Plans made, found space, commissioned companies, earth mounds modeled for a circuit: A year later, almost everything was ready - but even before the official opening of the BMX track, this was already over.
Omissions in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among local residents, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for a building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year still visible happens," she said.
It should then be started without "further commemorative break" with the work on the former indoor pool.
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and assures politicians of its help in addressing the problems ahead.
“I consider this to be our country’s biggest challenge since reunification.”
“In principle, nobody can say that’s none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
"This must interest every single one of them to get to grips with this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23. In September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and will meet the Minister of State Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"That's where the issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and will help.
But politics must set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesliga players also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's head of sport, Rudi Völler, told the Bild newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as a "self-evident."
“The refugee drama is going to everyone, no one is allowed to look away.”
"We football leagues can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
For the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their places was great.
What is just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we spent is lived in football.
"This is of tremendous importance," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The chief executive of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye as a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA, he had fallen after midnight on a water glass, which he had worn in his left hand, report the “Wirtschaftswoche” on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the road - that's what he told us last week," the "WiWo" quotes SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott, however, can pursue his work.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
“I’m fully there for SAP, fully in my job.”
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been to the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to him to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the “SZ”: “To anyone such a thing can happen.”
“What’s important is to get up again when you’ve fallen.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo, explaining that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible for the two regulars Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore at the weekend, as well as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally smashed.
The national player will also miss the leader of the Bundesliga in a duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"We unfortunately can't resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high strain on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his regular eleven at the Reus position.
Thus, he announced a change at the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, left Tuchel open.
He will also be in the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl to be understandable: "This is not so wrong Marco."
“I think we have a good chance to pick up the title.”
Robotic cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the will of the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure, among other things.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the car show IAA of a "new mobility age."
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and cause less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on Autobahn 9 in Bavaria to test new technology.
In order to ensure that the driver "is not burdened with additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to campaign for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for the people as drivers.
When driving automatically, the car increasingly takes over the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "only expected far after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany at around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or Americans.
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomously driving cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the United States.
In any case, motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the highway, 15 percent could imagine this in the flowing traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Well one in four would not leave the car the control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis European Championships
The Düsseldorfer wants to stand by the current state in the title fights of the 25. September to 4. October only pitch in singles.
The final decision is to be taken no later than 22. September fall.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
“The boys found out in the morning.”
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time at a long-term agreed sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, was also reminiscent of the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
“At that time, Timo was missing too, and we became European champions.”
"We should orient ourselves to that," explained the world number five.
Manchester United's England international Luke Shaw has sustained a serious injury to his right leg.
At the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno during a tackle and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in the 20-year-old teammate of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a big fashion show and a wax figure horror cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits, became the big star of the fashion scene - and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk," which was created by 18. On to be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially dismissive attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "To me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously stopped in Montreal, Canada and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful dresses," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has made fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not set up, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to style the dolls, for example, a stylist was hired.
The makers have carted 14 tons of material to Munich, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, tentative fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he had put on his teddy bras and dresses, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought them.
For his first own fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion leader Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a bigger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stile epochs, forms an increasing job potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and embroidery.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken away.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Nowadays, mass-produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So there are enough reasons for new paths.
The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been holding a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxony University of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often varied only slightly to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before, I could not do anything with the traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"A lot of people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memento.
With this, I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new 'Mary Poppins' movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still ventures to a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel, which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who Poppins is playing more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open up the economy more broadly to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business start-ups," he said in an address at the 16th. Meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the residents' registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are out of the question for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is significant as it assigns the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment governed by the rule of law and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of debt-financed companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities, and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors, was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thus expecting consumers to have a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper of the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and toddlers," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predators are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the still applicable limit values.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates strongly across the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies."
However, the Federal Ministry for the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly released into the environment through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded," had quoted the "Mirror" in March from the paper.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
