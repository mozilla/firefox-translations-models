The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a major customer of #PRS_ORG# and so it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should include the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for $249.
Today it costs $179.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel and reorder the order for the better price or is there another option of crediting?
I also find that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help with the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can choose best if this suits your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany you for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether that’s a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime novel / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title partout doesn’t want to come to mind anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that is suppressed in the brain a center of anxiety and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death on purpose)
This face fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough action I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the WiFi available.
Need to contact my husband first.
That may take time, though.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the difference in price transferred back?
Child, 4 years, splinters under the thumb nail

Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotives of the H0 and 0 gauges.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He has the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2 and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log on to a suitable digital control panel fully automatically.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable control panels.
Auxiliary registers exist for control centers that can only program the CVs of 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to be mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC shuttle pull system allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC paths.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push for booster vaccination
Ever new Omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
By New Year's Day, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers than previously sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one is facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's boost now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favor of everyone imagining with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over an official's feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today is not
Obviously, the chair had an undecetable shortage in sales.
How else can such cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG# tempted.
But that has been working since approx.
No more 14 days.
Therefore, I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or we think we could not help them.
I realize that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, afraid of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, is sometimes very close to the tears myself, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I would like to help you with this in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the good of the series for "League of Legends"?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliance.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with the review of the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in the stomach".
However, this did not settle after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
A statistic is mentioned as a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: “We were simply not focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained”.
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely different: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
“It felt like it was in front of 10 000 people.”
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team themselves, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and still came up to eight points, having already covered 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to squabble.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed that.
Yes, I already came forward a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have written them again.
We originally came forward half a year ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that doesn't happen.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on regulatory order" to contain the corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates, which were already laid in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12. December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist nicht Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and thought of etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear happiness" he is on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister of construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as it has been demanded in Berlin in a referendum.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent level.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the U.S.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be deplored.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes have wreaked havoc in the United States and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of devastation, especially in the limb state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tornado had raced through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that's even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers are increasing every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she sold out display case #NAME#.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is she completely out of the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if this arrived or is being processed, because I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government further rejects the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees monetary premiums for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He has moved to a company he blasphemed about.
This doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Boron for the greeting!
I am currently leading the adventure About the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts invented and now I am in the process of writing the entry-level adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premium is that the heroes are to bring a carriage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is said to be lurking in a group of goblins and luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in a variety of ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
In case of non-notice, the goblins lurk the hero in a hollow path and flank the carriage armed to three left and right arches, while two with spears stop the carriage.
Should it come to battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then by the son of the village school, a half-elf, and healed.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this very half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to heed many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I've disassembled the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
If you can then have the return slips come, I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was canceled today in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind the planning, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons the F1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else must be limited, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident well.
Then there was again unknowledge of the rules in the F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there is this possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
Nor is it the first guesswork, which is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally, the artist’s comment style does not like Roos, but admit that this is a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses, which both simply make unprofessional appear, such as ordering coffee from the (just as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "Uuuuuh HD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a lot of unrest in the commentary, which he apparently does not take this seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV only the German soundtrack without comment has to do right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels in the trainings make less advertising than Sky, and that as free-to-air TV stations.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of replays.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races, which they are still allowed to broadcast, except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will review and send an email and she has never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect more outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump, you can also set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here you would want to name a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outflower or similar by means of an air hose 4/6 mm... and you can start.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher as the water level, and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump sits lower like the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water running backwards once water would run backwards, that the water from the basin would run through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, then daily packing is carried and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is out of tune just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scold these services, even if we say at the moment,... they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Can you also order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly crowned astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space in 1961 as a Nasa astronaut, after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess as well as his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his missions and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies to 100 kilometers altitude
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again braked by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned all-out trip: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory I am not bothered (have already behind me the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also found out about career prospects before my studies thought about career prospects at the time that I definitely want to study until I have a doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially oppressively the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really be interested:
1) What are you working as at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and may consider dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have experience write it :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
It seems that there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "ascent" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies will make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here order there, all *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "next week" sounds like so much time and that's not allowed to be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully annoyed.
What's this self-hostate because of holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to treat them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independently on it.
My question is simple: are we, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The nice thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the festival by baking cookies with her son and crafting.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of the moulting and plumage regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON organic gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird farming is solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during the moulter are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately still not working
East German handicraft model Old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway company ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which is designed for the traction of the German-Company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally reworked
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive, which was to be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains with 45 km/h cruising speed on this route.
The maximum speed required 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with tatz bearing drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens shuckery with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The Reichsbahn repair plant in Dessau was found to be worth reappraising of all six locomotives.
[4] When there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service as the reelectrification of the Central German network was progressive, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked up in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger quantities were first preferably constructed.
It was only when the E 94 was foreseeable that the number of reprocessing could not be further increased that the E 95 became the focus of the reprocessing.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the railway depot Hall P in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematically with increasing age.
Thus, it often happened that shooters remained stuck in switching actions.
Then the passenger with a hammer and wooden wedge, who was constantly driving on this locomotive, had to release the shooter again during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinters, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, it was concluded that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only in a single way, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which was 5. October 1970 the service quit.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were disassembled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main station Halle.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external work-up of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it for a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the inner completion of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum Halle (Saale) is responsible for the locomotive museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
Main area of application was initially Silesia
Manual work model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusted, with traces of play, basement smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small support - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes the F-parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do?
I can't build the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the provided bracket.
So I get sent new ones.
When are they going to be sent off?
No not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is to fulfill its purpose
With me they're not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you?
Residential house fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume an intentional arson.
The police force Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To invalidate fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had so far not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his corona vaccine.
The illness of a friend had led him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he is receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the "LinkedIn" network on Friday.
“For several months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumours.”
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He did not ask for the reasons.
“The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and suspicion.”
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine itself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the biontech boss has, according to his own data, vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire went out on Friday evening with 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for the tireless commitment," said the head of the primary technology division, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out at around 19:15 on Friday, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30.
Since 23:15, the last affected by the failure would have electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
Authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for key buildings on Saturday lunchtime.
"What is important now is that the citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or single people and communicate to the local fire appliance houses when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in Euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the base on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of these.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can not push it into each other and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send her back, otherwise she's not fit for purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
Yes, this is really easier!
Then we'll do it like this!
Will you send me the return slip by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We disagree with that
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins

I have to work in between!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new paint, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly next to the stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick swipe back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks if they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve true-to-original appearance through the decals or Decals.
From sovereign signs on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates for car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order, as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and set it up.
Decals are also called water slide patterns because you briefly moisten their backside with water until the carrier paper darkens through the wet.
Then you only push the picture a small piece of the paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away on the side.
Warning: Always check whether the picture is sitting properly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkles or even tears.
Suck off excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else, then I no longer read the book and have to log out and register and load the book again and look for the job until I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.

I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, it suddenly turns across.
In turn:
We had applied for the fertility train in advance at the PKV and got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again requested the assumption of costs from the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to refund 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance claim begins with the healing treatment, it ends when treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the commitments that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We're not going to order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to forward that to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment was made and now you tell me that I have to send this thing back first.
I can't help the dresser completely disturbed with me
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they're not allowed to sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to procure a different type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly a low-budget movie is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits for this.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
If I am a very good customer of yours, have already 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Sincerely
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes about the waiting position...I will give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
'Half victory' against Belarus linked to high cost to EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus doesn't give quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There is apparently an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It apparently cannot prevail if a member state sits in its head to do its thing," as Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to cross Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants had been arrested in the night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a ruler in Minsk of having attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule-breakings during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula One final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes have appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule-breakings in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have illegally overtaken.
A second objection was lodged against the rating at the end of the race.
According to the Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and contact you again
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains lit up red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the theme park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Watching bright fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirm that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not like Original 1699€?

I already had a lot of trouble with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I left the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question would be whether my request was received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of them from our household.
Contact Woman #NAME#.

This email hasn't come so far.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite means nothing.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither will admit it to your i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is just completely lost.
Because of me, a God got the whole thing going.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just tapping nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to take further seriousness like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually without a directory and colour error.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, please refer to the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices – i.e. also in impact magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (present in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations in the sale of fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even driven home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit funny, he says.
And the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate this accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "turner", which does not sound so delicious.
Fiber optic problems + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable Wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrive.
However, the other LAN module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less it arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms located away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" with fiber optic over the power line?
Is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN Kabel in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change your checking account
Anyone who thought that now would be quiet with the current accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank Group division - to €50,000 for checking and investment accounts and €25 .000 for daily allowance accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin against this regulation even got right.
Banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers must be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood.
But their lives resemble an ascent and descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who caused a furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans fly to her in equal measure is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with happiness - and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact of gangs, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishes his career in the motorsport premier class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Cup in the Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times.
Frederick gets 60. World Cup win - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated that I would have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, in which he drove from third to one.
Then he changed the material setting somewhat and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds left.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the Briton Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was third.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also added his 22nd. Victory in series.
For Stuttgart, Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner came in fifth place this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after finishing fourth.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bobsled Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualifier, she posted the first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just pushing, but there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn’t receive it and therefore could not redeem why I finally asked.
Corona caused me to have completely different problems last year and never time for it.
And now it was his name was expired which made me very upset.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again, because it is just reduced :)
Why will the shipment only start on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken down by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered would.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it's one - or the other so...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6J together) is sick, has a burn 2. Grades fetched on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we snuggled up a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
He is on top of that cooled and we are currently seeing ourselves less (1-2x week) which makes me very difficult with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child is just having a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and strokes.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework on us, which we naturally divide.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is just quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I'm fine and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently asking for a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not yet done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least a little something prepare.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Just until your birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm packing the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't do it...
Are you feeling the same?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kpts.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that’s why I thought that I’m sure I’ll find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now, I get other color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
And two times.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them, such as math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But if it were simply strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write English that too well
This has been a very long time, then I would refrain from
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response in a timely manner, by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
First, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom in order to be able to live.
The transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that tells you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has slept from week 1 only on her stomach.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can withstand much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right, no cuddly toys, go in and watch more often, but not minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when they are asleep.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it raise up from the stomach?
Or is it with your face forward Directly in the mattress?
You can deduce whether everything is okay.
We also all grew up and when my husband was born, it was gang and would give the kids to be put on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and no feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To be very clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
Only it is simply the case that the politics of this channel are now under everyone's sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You do not want to be a running pillar.
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising station that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A crog man who completely lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ash.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in a stomachache or just for cuddling – my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry-core pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and dispense it in a metered manner.
The removable inner cushion is easy to heat in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat support exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical smell, stick or burn spots and dispose of them immediately if they are present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
In the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes heating (note the information from the microwave manufacturer!)
Spread the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking immediately after heating!
Then put the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears during repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please the temperature of the pillow on suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm flexion!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory complaints, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, and in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores emerge, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after first-round series second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
Things are not going well under the third coach for Ingolstadt either.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed entry under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and ca. 3 years old) no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Misreporting, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply.
I have then removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
Even larger photo equipment swallows 20 litres of capacity without problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various “filling levels”: there are 4 anchor beams, stable rivets, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without latching the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to rummage through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday practicality of the backpack: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is scheduled to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# yesterday has an email to me from confirmation for the commissioning of the

Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the item delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not have guessed and just could not redeem it in a timely manner and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety during braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are suitable for certain slices and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the country's fastest-growing and thriving cities.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses and building businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues so as not to go bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “Engine Building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning guns.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, so has hidden each location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lesser rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians now make serious allegations against him.
​Please take care of yourself, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other leaders must never, never, never! be concerned with power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on elimination of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide elimination of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated people.
"We countries need quick clarity on whether and when for three times vaccinated the test requirement can be dispensed with," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers’ Conference next Tuesday. − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated account details.
What can this be because of?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 to 1000 on.
The most common is to hear sounds/voices, less often to see pictures and least of all to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, because to protect the child until nibbling, a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **per definition had none.
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email you didn't answer.
Again, the question.
The order and on the invoice states that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were only delivering to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not going to be called?
I had a question formulated
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an director.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The harrowing diarium of a slow departure from the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I have witnessed my life thanks here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used primarily in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not charged
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in regular time against hosts Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Roulade tips & tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
This was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a beef stock for that.
Do you have any tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can do that
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by email that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you check there, please.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is part of the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't got poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a tube output stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve afloat when it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or when direct recordings are used.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footbutton, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the relevant effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it that way with others.
Will it give you the opportunity to send the lamp back?
Since she's hanging too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
Negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear deal are showing progress, according to Iranian figures.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that are supposed to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to relaunch the agreement had continued after just under a week-long interruption.
The negotiations will be attended by negotiators of Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia.
A U.S. delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
The only federal state is the value above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to be above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in Germany, this figure stood at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 severely ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and hardly get behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
I don’t have to click/indicate/fill out?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, a cheek.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, you can see one thing: It is not extensive.
We have come into a winter rigidity and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here really still have a buck for the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is in demand, which would like to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found a, simply put, pile of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we be able to appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten some things, but that’s not bad, we’ve got the discord at the end.
If you have the time and desire, come to the Discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/chunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I beg you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for the pick-up - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or to decide on the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently probably eats meat very rarely.
I was a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to be vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and she meant where her meat came from and you reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was to “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put in a corner as a vegan and conflicts arise without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
You do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance marketing.
I am not on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can not be on site because of a funeral, this unfortunately cannot be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
Lahnsteiner Weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant notice of 45,000 euros in the Lahnstein town hall for the new equipment car water rescue of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects permanent increases in missions: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, had synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment during the order process?

Thank you for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also arms carrier in the executive, I do not want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and arms carrier people to the right of conservative magic should be clear to everyone that these people can of course deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because of course you have in addition to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the excessively feminine clichéd gays, because these are in the executive rather less to normal women)and I must leave, because when in doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds funny in my experience, even if it sounds funny in my experience, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks it has to be right for them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are openly allowed to speak their minds there or even openly make any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police and soldiers who were often in foreign operations often start to flat-rate due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there is certainly also a right-wing comrade-in-heart who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, this is well fought in my opinion and also with political education and enlightenment the whole thing counteracted!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I do not understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket in Germany somewhere available.
I'm always just finding you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Neat through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean.
But it’s never “that someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with child?
We don’t have any work on it yet and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and, for example, is always there fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have trained in software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again for a long time and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or Anxiously avoiding personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and are accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I look unapproachable (but I think that has already become better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the specific daily work is really the way I imagine it to be, and it’s difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ESA already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("again the simplest things hit") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how this is possible"/"I'll keep him from work with my stupid questions" / "he must really consider me to be less important" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the point.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for a date for pickup
What do you mean by giving back, please!
When I download a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and in turn builds up its own body proteins from them, which it also needs for plumage.
The formation of plumage in nestling and the formation of plumage in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this periodic administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One coated measuring spoon (in the case) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON organic.
In the case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of new plumage is visible.
After that, the normal dose is served until the new plumage is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to announce that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
statement of a community employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So, a case application made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think so, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check it out?
Release: Serious traffic accident at Selb

Oh, okay, understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
Merry Christmas to you first!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just dismantling everything you can think.
Before I come here now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the ref as a lateral entrant right now.
Originally I studied something different and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I do not mention anything more precisely here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up at the teacher training and was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other job postings".
And it's only half a year around.
With the paintings before that, I've always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can still pivot.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time for the last month that I've been completely exhausted.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend and my work.
I had free time.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that annoy me in addition.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it closes completely - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of you'll be able to do so here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and worked out together in a team and not as a lone fighter like most of the time the case.
But then I wonder if I won't get back to the same place in a year as I am now and unhappy.
You realize it’s all kind of confused, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, which I’m completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me to do.
Thank you for reading and excuse the tearful undertone of mine.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has steadily evolved, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times in order to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists will find a maximum range of sounds here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stroke, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's series of defeats in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
One possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a slip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photo items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa with 84 days.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava thick.
That's equivalent to nearly 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new headlands with a size of about 50 hectares were formed off the coast by cold lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants lives directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about itself combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of gift-giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peacemaking "social contract of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gifting.
Previously, gifts were handed over on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular custom emerged in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially for the children.
Protestants came across this custom because they reject mediators between God and people as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they are defending themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gifting thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only upsets few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the custom of St. Nicholas, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the use of St. Martin with Martin's singing and Martin's parade.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought-after luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th. century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, a cheerful cuddle muddle prevails over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, who has little in common with the rather strict beard of assyr of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer and the favor of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who was said to have gone to a bank and a bookmaker's business with a gun.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was still pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are set in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth skewers.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hours.
- The robust plastic version can be used all year round outdoors.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural-formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself great preparatory work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require supply line or batteries.
Place the “light stone” in any place illuminated by the sun in the day.
Two supplied earth skewers provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic sheath itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the case.
At dusk, “Smart Stone” begins to glow automatically; in what color, you determine yourself: Six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this several times before it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year of reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I necessarily started to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again, because I already have to take enough medication through chronic diseases, which I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had got on my last two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it burdened me quite a lot and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid that this time.
Perfume-free and without gedöns, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Gynae physician unfortunately did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is so a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule lichen and the acne topic.
I also have nutrition in the course of h. Illness tried everything possible and I have stuck on sugar, milk and meat arms mixed food, because otherwise nothing really worked well.
It may also be good that Hormonally the worm is just in it, but if you have construction site everywhere like me you want to go to look anymore what else is wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work and on the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what's there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but it generally exists in large

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I have been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in the field of geography in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors and with me every hour is actually on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to invest an excessive amount of time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to complete the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation around the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or healed are allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales slumps.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-daily need, sales slumps had to be complained, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be actually the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without a ground," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Things are only going well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon scheme must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the ribbon received on that day.
In addition, in the retail sector, as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high level of personnel and administrative effort, an attempt is made for the centers to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, at a central location in the center once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a fault that has been attempted to be laminated with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures that the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire generates a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach areas.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press a longer time on one of the memory keys and is finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is again in the case of new switch-on - very practical in the studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester the same built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can go directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by means of brakes on both sides.
It was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that is also included in the delivery a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories that you may still want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in series victoryless Hesse were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga bust.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration of a mixed start to the season from the soul within a good hour and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered on DAZN, saying a "package praise, to every single one who was there."
At first, it looked like a new dampener for the now in ninth place still behind their expectations Frankfurter.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusen team in the lead with 2:0 remaining.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to get back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of play and his muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," the 27-year-old said, looking forward to the result in particular for the spectators with a look at the result.
This was the party we were going to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus for the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away match at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on the programme on Wednesday in the wake of the English week.
I will definitely receive the mail that my package will come back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, would mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women ahead of quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women sneaked off the parquet after the humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and empty glances.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," Germany coach Henk Groener ruled.
We have to be different against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany completed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game of all that we have to erase," captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must come against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defence," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed with the kick-off.
Miscues and technical errors in attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 backlog after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-kick.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial ignition.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also red.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
It was only in the closing stages of the first half that the DHB selection came into the game a little better and at least five goals until the break.
The already only quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19 gone.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer absorb an increase in performance and went off the scene as a clear loser.

The title exists, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it will continue partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, it's compatible with vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the corona vaccination regulation and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in allergic reactions (never happens to me).
The vaccination itself is delegateable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have none, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they cannot (may?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has been provided in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" for fierce reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguided by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And also no one "to whom everything has to go quickly".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused many Upper Palatinate astonishment.
"The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which left an educational gap with it - probably also for some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books in 2 weeks.
After the confirmation, the following error message always comes: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice in road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little bit in preparation for my bike ride in the coming week.
Said, done and I rode my road bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what is lurking in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to participate in the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to get me spare coat and spare hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn back around with a halfway bad mood and take home the first track.
Was then also not quite so bad in terms of mood technology, maybe it is also better if I practice again before the bike ride with the tire change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, has the day I came to pick up the bike until 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But if I think that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I’m really in a bad mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me wondered why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unrestled.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tires now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have 25x622 on the road bike at the moment.
They also exist (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a road bike to other tyres?
The Schwalbe side seems to my absolute! Lay knowledge more likely to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car hurls against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had bounced on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a central island and subsequently on the opposite road, the police announced.
There it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was subsequently hurled against a tree and the man trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old, as well as his 23-year-old passenger, were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have newcomers.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a suitably designed foot is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but is to be achieved in terms of sound but an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-frequency rise.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the excessively high frequencies to greatly increasing bundling.
Exactly aligned to the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-frequency range can be slightly turned outwards and the sound can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for corresponding changes in the construction.
If, for example, the housings are to be veneered, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adapted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate location, in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis in the interior as large as possible.
The four screw-down points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture “Detail Bevel”.
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in the material thickness if necessary, provided that you want to use, for example, finished strips from the hardware store instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forester drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Then you use a round milling cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the foot plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking out / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm bore into the foot to the terminal opening and leave it there approx. Stand out 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and also lets it hang loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, hot glue can be dripped onto the opening and thus closed.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) has to be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people by circuit, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get some drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
