Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old motorist wanted to turn around 21.30 clock with her VW from Merklingen coming to the left on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
In the process, she overlooked the 24-year-old, right-of-way motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
In the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still grazed it at the rear vehicle area.
Due to the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Present-of-mind, he steered his motorcycle into the green stiffeners next to the roadway and had it rolled out without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of more than 3300, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
Infected people were separated from uninfected employees in the yard, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government joint responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infection events have to take effect and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary managing director.
The SPD sees this very similarly: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“In our view, the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions must be closely controlled.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement."

There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were clashes between the two people again.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.

Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks of half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
"I think it makes sense to make urgently necessary adjustments in the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report said.
A Justice Department spokesman told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether it would require legal adjustments if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already advocated for data retention in June.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, according to ESPN, is back in isolation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou," as he is called in the NBA, already voiced his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, n.d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has prescribed a ten-day quarantine.
With this, the Clippers star misses the first two official matches after the Test match phase.
At Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale, which begins in the night on Friday.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a test substance sive for large farms.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politics.
Nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries currently work on the large vegetable farm, with over a third infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the more than 3300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
'Conscience bite': Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: "He regrets the acts very much, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and very taken away by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged in a fire during the night on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed suspicions of arson.
The suspect, who has now been detained, had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the field of view of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," Grindel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors for associations that want to break into this phalanx.
But he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will in the end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
“FC Bayern is making a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," the 58-year-old explained.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been individuals who noticed this mistake and pierced it to the press instead of addressing it," Grindel said of the acceptance of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“That has already kept me very busy humanly.”
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian functionary.
"I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from that," Grindel said.
“I have been completely transparent and unsuspecting with the ominous watch gift.
Many in the DFB knew about it.”
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
“This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”
'Black Lives Matter': Injured and one dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have escalated again through Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train just crossed an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including officials from the federal police, used tear gas in the night to Saturday and violently drove protesters apart.
Hundreds, partly armed protesters marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid at her Louisville apartment.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to broadcaster NBC, they were taken to hospital.
None of them were in danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died in the wake of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they took a suspect into custody.
She has so far not provided further details on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler said he was, like many in the city, "inconsolate and stunned" about what had happened.
Also in the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters delivered clashes with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trucks in front of a juvenile prison, police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters had smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late on Saturday evening (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police announced.
investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big rush was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy feast.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burns, Rakoczy ball or procession, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have received it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has always been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So again this time in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold-Casino, watch the historical ones strolling and listen to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
“That’s a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant in part more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was on Saturdays and Sundays in costume on foot in the city.
"That's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were travelling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament would also take place again.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second division team Fuenlabrada
Spanish second division footballer CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into crisis because of a corona outbreak.

Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm currently working with the team to set out the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the economy ministry in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debts of the second-largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That's why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors forgo a portion of their claims of around $66 billion (around €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country threatens the state bankruptcy again.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent recently.
For the current year, experts expect economic strength to fall by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims of $503 million and had slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learns that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notary Office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer started the work, the normal day-to-day business is already running at full speed.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to shift the food center from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been a household name for it.
During visits on site with her family in the past months, she again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career plays a central role in her native Lower Bavaria: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd degree. State examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a nota-assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "by the way" she shouldered the doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely taken over - and has a compliment for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten or crèche places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the Tagesspiegel newspaper.
Usually, the arena in the precinct city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently “well advised to take a stable side-long” for the first time.
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial waiver, which is intended to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," Berndt Urlesberger chuckles.
“Even though, of course, they don’t scream quite as loud as big babies.”
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9 shortly before the start of the holiday. Classes of the St. James Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange ideas with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias via Skype about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if everyone involved agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional charms, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.

De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "Vom Winde Verweht" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream."
The Warner Brothers film studio signed her for seven years and brought her out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz."
Three years later, the award came as best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She was also given a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel."
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she starred in "Luebelied for a Corpse."
The marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) gave rise to the son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumours of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final on comeback
World Cup seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler have missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf."
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen conceded a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz-expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive had decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
“However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.”
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
“It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has.”
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in elections in the future.
“The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered.”
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons for the officially now dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution classifies the coloration as "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a former membership in the now banned far-right "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also emphasized that the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz.
Neither the Federal Party will be weakened with this decision nor the right wing.
“The maneuver of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
One wants to escape further observation by the protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
“The AfD can’t get rid of the spirits it called.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
“Here, the AfD-Landesverband and the faction kept to their right-wing leader to this day.”
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration.
North Sea wind farms provide a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the forwarding through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the Tennet grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity mathematically.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing €20 billion by then in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is the 2. January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual setting after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not take this decision lightly and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
“But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as the organizer.”
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a contact follow-up could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg was comforting on next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, among other things, with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9. May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12. September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth not to beat in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth prevailed on Sunday in the special clearly against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle, the German was on Saturday on Quantaz clearly in front of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freeze ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is there for the 14th to 16. August planned.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Worms University of Applied Sciences continues to take to the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to make the start of studies possible not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are used equally both in the university and at the DFS air traffic control academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and staffing of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management degree program as part of their training as an air traffic controller at the University of Applied Sciences Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
“In these times, the promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS, when signing the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air traffic control is at the same time the motivation and commitment for the University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In the field of action for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus in the field of air transport, the Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford straight ahead in the curve at around 12.40pm in the Alzenau-Mitte exit and landed at the guardrail.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
However, the police currently assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay with it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to adopt a law of Heil this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Fingers away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if you do not want to choke off the economy completely".
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their added value at the customer for large areas of the craft, the construction industry and the plant construction.
“The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
“If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal work contract.”
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary agency work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not explainable why in the future, in the case of portioning and packaging cheese, different employment law should apply than with sausage, according to a statement on the legislative project, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
If banned, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
In many cases, Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of an audit of the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, sometimes 16 hours a day.
They often did not have a break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
“Now it has to be fundamentally cleaned up.”
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Westphalia Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates in occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft present to the dpa includes amendments to the law on securing workers’ rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive checks necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example also animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more personnel positions are also needed for more checks.
Three killed in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to the police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to police.
The “Rheinische Post” reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
No further details were initially disclosed.
Eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday has also gone peacefully.
Most recently, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left it at 1 a.m. before the curfew began.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, a larger police force was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, a ban on entry for the Opera Square, on which there had been riots a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained calm.
Car rolls over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries at about 13:25 on Sunday.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
Using thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the Federal road 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the roadway for a previously unexplained cause and overturned several times.
In order to rescue the injured person, the fire department had to cut free the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the person search.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone between the high maize plants.
The seriously injured person was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Nearly 50 emergency personnel from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total of 36. Scudetto of the club's history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo scored at 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer to be ousted from number one two matchdays before the end of the season of Serie A.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the final action.
A play-in from Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old exploited from the penalty area boundary directly with a flat shot (45th+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lacklustre but decisive success.
The foul penalty missed to the bar in the 89th. Minute should have only Ronaldo himself properly accerated with regard to the goal-scoring rating.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," coach Maurizio Sarri explained even after the 1:2 win over Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinians had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve recently had the calming lead at the top of the table thanks to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had managed only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals on his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.
Juventus are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, must on the 7th August against Olympique Lyon, however, make up for a 0:1 first leg to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest has already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative figures for the years before, the racers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races at the public prosecutor’s offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they had taken flight from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to cash in: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonment sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the several tragic accidents and processes of previous years and indicated more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with razors. Again and again, motorists brake the traffic there to make room and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made there to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and puffed-up sports and luxury bodies often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
“The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to be legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more on the road.”
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Whoever defies all rules in such a way and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly attainable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger crackdown on police
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher checks on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon to become more painful and serious seriousness from the high-speed show of force: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen," according to the paper of the Ministry of the interior.

Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has on the final stage of the 10. Sibiu Tour wins his second day.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took over the top in the class.

No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season's restart with a win," Ackermann had declared after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," the 26-year-old said.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
According to the rules of the world association UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the complete tour, the driver and supervisor in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organizing team and the media.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instruction for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday lunchtime in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) was suddenly lying lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received at just before 1 p.m.

The fire spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events intensified.
To a big tuning meeting it is on Saturday night (25. July 2020) in Nuremberg South City.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police Middle Franconia, an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 22.30.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "scene"
The officers counted to the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police accounted.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it can be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license was extinguished.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Police Headquarters of Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the advent of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to do any damage.
“After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed.”
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time abuse
The Federal Employment Agency (BA) investigates according to its own statement about 900 suspected cases of abuse in the short-time worker's money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board member responsible for the operational business, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
“There was not that much time available to us at this hot stage.
All the more closely we will look at the final settlements.
I'm sure there's still a lot to come up with.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Evidence of abuse would often come from the affected employees or unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
“Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves in case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency benefit.
The figures are still unremarkable, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said on PNN request.
The young people left the park.
On Saturday night, some youngsters would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by precinct drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 circumvention regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party during the night to Sunday.
The event was disbanded by police.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (AP) - English football record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last day of the Premier League by a 2:0 (0:0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now settle for the Europa League because Chelsea still passed and qualified fourth for the premier class.
In the fight against relegation, Aston was allowed to cheer Villa.
Manchester United went through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71. minute) in the lead.
After a red card for Leicester City in the aftermath, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored for the final score.
Chelsea, Bayern's opponents in the Champions League quarter-finals, won against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who still moved past the Wolves with a meagre 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to tremble for West Ham United for a long time to maintain the class.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) equalized immediately Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, descends after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who failed to save themselves by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.

It's going to be hard."
The Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied in the end.
Because of the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were of the 13th. March to 17. June was interrupted.
In the meantime, even a premature termination or a hosting of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
After all, however, the season could be played without any special occurrences - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly fierce.
There were violent clashes during the night.
Israeli police have violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem during the night to Sunday.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said.
The police used water cannons, among other things, to dissolve the rally.
In total, around 6000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's seat of office, according to media reports on Saturday night.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew into horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private mansion in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man has been arrested near Tel Aviv, according to police, because of being suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on protesters by the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was last at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen prompted nine lightly injured.
A female driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van who was driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks down border town after corona suspect case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "luminous success."
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Because of a first official suspected coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the vicious virus could have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
The state of emergency had been imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "luminous success."
The details were doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an "outlier" that occurred on the 19th. July illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea.
The person defected to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for the crossing of the border within the four-kilometer-wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations into some people.
North Korea called on Saturday on the suspicion of an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
"Kim has already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The party's central military commission is to investigate the "runaway" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
Kaesong is estimated to be home to about 300,000 people.
Tension before council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion ahead of big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale downtown development project East," it says rather casually in the middle section of the city press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28. July, at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even dismissive in individual committees depending on attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) that the project developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and the local council now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "vilification" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list to the local council for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit would be cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of the existence of Klein is convinced to refurbish for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than forecast in the town hall and on the part of the proponents from the economy.
To shape the city by its own strength and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping open of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a smaller downtown redesign ideally with local institutions.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution, caused by road traffic, including frequent speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus of noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned cycles and through little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the municipal day-care facilities and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protections.
With a lot of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start on the 31. July in his premiership season at the ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of supercars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season," says Zimmermann.
“With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman has experienced GT racing and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring.”
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From the 31. July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track, however.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track much," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community, Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast.”
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams play a little poker in the tests, of course," he says.
“In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.”
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will reach into the GT steering wheel.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of those countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new scheme will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are just on holiday, only from Saturday, the 1. August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers are likely to have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
“But apparently no one bothered to let Grant Shapps know.”
Almost a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the British's favourite holiday countries.
The British government is currently discounting from unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are exempt.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country an equipment of the warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the combat possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defence also informed the agency about successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
Construction will continue to be carried out on the nuclear-encapable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal destinations.
The president, who himself also rode a military boat, said that 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth this year alone.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal towns, too, the naval forces celebrated the Navy Day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a show of weapons in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence included not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made difficult because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. climate agency NOAA announced in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous districts.
The corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, complicates the work of the aid workers, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is even more exacerbated considering it sweeps through an area most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5000 people have died so far in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who would have to leave their homes to exercise caution.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to broadcaster CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning taken back again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had hit land on the island of Padre Island immediately off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
Tropical Storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had initially been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move inland and head towards northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading towards Hawaii during the night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is said to be close to the largest islands in Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are to be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which are developing into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of a below average even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals cancelled: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were stripped of two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals cancelled: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard against a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Hosts Naples were through a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th Minute into the lead, in the 32. Minute cheered Filip Djuricic initially the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also took back the refereeing team after hinting from the VAR.
In the aftermath, Allan made the 2:0 final score perfect for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
“The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records," writes the Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who has recovered "somewhat well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury to world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and threatens to be missing in crucial premier class duels.
In the Munich smuggling weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player will have to pause in the battle for the title is open to question.
A use in the quarter-final second leg against Chelsea on 8. August is likely to be difficult, to the one on the 12th. The 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon in August.
Bayern, however, do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
Flick, in his personal triple formula, cited the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should be his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final on the 23rd. August show.
“We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellent.
Now it's time to create the special thing," Flick said.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the eighth final obligation against Chelsea is on the agenda.
After 3:0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare in the domestic arena as in the lost "final dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game," said Flick.
A test to tune in is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long address, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the newcomers, has fitted in well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, training is now carried out in team strength for the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record goal scorer Klose and Flick know about so many joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 attunement.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
At the tournament with nine-team teams, it was also ambitious on Sunday to the point.
Of the top performers, all were present, including the churn-willing Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the premier class season are not assured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Championship titles.
All America races, however, were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão, Portugal, will be driven.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
According to the current state of affairs, the 2020 racing calendar thus comprises 13 races.
"We are delighted that we are continuing to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The regulations of Formula 1 require, however, at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the approaching corona crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being back with them next season," Carey explained.
The cancellation of the America races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a rejection.
We are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a video on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she encountered with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a video-switching guest on a popular US latenight show.
She told about her fight against the powerful of the world, among other things.
Also talking about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump, the teenager.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known Latenight show, she spoke about her plans in the future, as well as her encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump at last year's U.N. climate summit.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on your broadcast on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to to turn the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children is taking to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leaders who scoff against her on social media or even try to silence her finds her "funny" as the reactions show her "because they have no other answer to it."
Things got particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitterly evil look.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the nude was sailing across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF emerged, i.e. an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively openly asked question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the quick answer and disappeared from the picture with a laugh.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, has died.
He had died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, a further opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton paid tribute to Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood, in an emotional response, spoke of a "monumental loss" for all previous and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in 1967 in London, to this day his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There is said to have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental health issues are also said to have played a role.
Three years after its foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
From a young age, he was passionate about US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media buzz, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star who had returned to earth.
Free from drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
