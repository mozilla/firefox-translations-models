A Republican strategy to face Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that voter fraud is rarer in the U.S. than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in 10 years in the U.S.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have proclaimed new laws since 2009 that make the procedure for registration or ballot more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained traction after the November 2010 election, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on Election Day, and citizens are denied the right to vote for which a court file is available.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state has required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identification card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens own, i.e. 21 million eligible voters not a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often payable to get the required ID.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who are increasingly casting their votes for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the tickets issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state has required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on Election Day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general elections contributed to this, approx. 10 million Registering citizens.
This is because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Also, Republican lawmakers have passed legislation in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. attorney general has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The Democratic critics denounce the partisan political nature of the passed laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be taken or not?
The PSA test in fact sometimes has faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be taken or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
The study conducted in the U.S. has had numerous disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that with a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or. 40 years if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made truly understanding the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases one is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, no treatment takes place in many men who have been diagnosed with cancer, as their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and treated if the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision on who should be treated and who should not be determined.
That’s why I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most important, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the international Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone was eating well and moving sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It severely damages people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million in Quebec. Smokers," regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, wretched, rectum, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against wrist intestine cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of a wretch or to develop mast colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin additions and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was more likely to show an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family background.
"Executing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has caused some stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it's not yet entirely certain that it's really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it is actually the Higgs, because there is apparently only a small risk of being mistaken, and let’s look at what it is about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects to not be present in the same place at the same time.
It's not possible to violate this rule - and don't try too hard as you'll hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state," with this "state" broadly consisting of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, who are not sacred to anything - definitely not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing), these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" that is the "messailor" of electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this location, like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be smashed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not, in fact, all particles and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a piece of paper would never keep on the fridge by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do possess a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not possess mass.
For what can all this research be "good," Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely study all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, since it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which is approx. 80% of the matter of the universe forms (renewed ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found in the CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous stroke laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially regarded more as a "lab play."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the tools that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With her Committee on "Dying in Dignity," Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate needs to resume shortly, although a bill will be prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a two-year deadline.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to get help with the food.
He even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"That depends on the ability of the person," to accept a step backwards, he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these steps backwards.
Patients admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer showered with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear of dying "consciously and through suffocation" is.
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says, before accepting that you put a mask on her to help her breathe.
She is still expecting a last visit from her son, who is from Italy, in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer with a group of volunteers personal care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, a bed for palliative care comes to 11,700 residents.
That's very little, considering that one day we'll all die.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants the dying person, depending on the wish, an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died over the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, there is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93, who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while bumping into his honor, a young man of 36 who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45," Dr shares. Christiane Martel is worried.
53% of the patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadboi come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is supposed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the greater Montreal area, are more or less specializing exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that ensures that several physicians specialized in palliative care face the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, that of prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to express her opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. According to Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to move on to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any action on her relief.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients until the last day despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied to me that she regretted giving up the fight, she said.
However, she told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not accepting this wish after their pains were relieved by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which amounts to euthanizing the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Property scandals of large scale in Quebec
Officials from the road construction office, construction companies, money-procurers of political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has disintegrated since drastic measures were taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation into the embezzlements related to Quebec's contracts for road construction, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he insists, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some curbed their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping it will succeed in "pointing out the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops on auditors, government investigators and analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau Force", which has since 2009 caused the "sewerage cartel" of Montreal to proceed more cautiously in the artificial inflation of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted rows of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
He himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for several years to a mediator linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by making him more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organised an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officers from the road construction office have admitted that they allowed themselves to be smeared by artificially inflating the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
Also, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property in 2010 that was acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately being conducted, she says she is "craving by a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system subverted by ants, to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She says the procedure is "painful but positive."
However, we are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need an investigative unit only designated for Montreal, as well as oversight to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchenneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but is above all concerned about the role of the "mandate-wearers who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak clap of reality."
Quebec's government is proposing to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, which he said would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about taking a look into their own backyard...
"PSG are not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress every day by her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
But I'm not bursting out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's new additions are used to playing games of very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This causes a player like me to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from an injury streak.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place of the frontrunner.
But we lurk in the ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the return match of the round of 16 as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a huge failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a huge disappointment.
This year we really care about to win this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to take the win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has scored an even better season.
I believe this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that can be blamed on us, that's certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what else people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn't managed to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and who has also made huge expenses!
In view of the invested sums, you were believed to be 15 points ahead at the break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG appear to be fully dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he's come and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This spurs the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was important to me to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from knocking out some game time.
I saw things there that I emerged stronger from.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have to demonstrate exemplary behavior.
What opinion do you have on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does that take place on 16. October in Spain forced draw (1:1) a kick-off match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payment and selling is possible without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to 2 dollars five months later before recovering to around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success,” “in competition with the dollar or euro” and “similar to traditional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” used to move forward in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) by gambling.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the public accounts account book distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of preliminary central banker, having the privilege of adding that additional line.
It is a dismemberment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "chopped up."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to cheat, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without linking, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided down to one hundred millionth, which leaves some leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering with the help of this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-final sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at the merchants, and the latter does not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, the ECB’s report envisages re-evaluating the various risks, which are now considered to be high in the event of a success of this currency.
We've pulled out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have in particular punished the Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed with the help of French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban in Kabul.
Conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war because of the struggles of the various seditious groups.
Their seizure of power at the time was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahidee, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by seizing government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American awarding of subcontracts.
They have put themselves in disrepute, and most of them have not been involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who could take advantage of the American grants: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls as well as boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain executives, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose authority it will be under is considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already seeking the restoration of the militias in the province that will evade the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization using the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution, the U.S. wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that was destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructures would have been required.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
No mining is possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations on the vast Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports to be largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was made on 20. November completed.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' grammar schools, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sector, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil military action" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures in dozens of mountain villages for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required numerous local workers, has helped to suppress the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard at these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 metres.
In the embassy, dozens of written requests from small agricultural projects have been received by municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation of lower, well-controlled and directly relating to civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which grants him the unrestricted power of attorney, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months to complete his work.
Egypt has now been relying on a preliminary, multiple-changed text for nearly two years, weakening institutional stability and leading to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample on the right."
On the part of its proponents, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text section by section.
For the president, it is also a way of finding his public and democratic legitimacy again, while the protest is raging across the country.
After reaffirming in an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will be benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited authority," the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not complied with the request.
Shortly before the declaration of constitution in mid-November, they turned away, as they believe they have not been able to bring their views to fruition.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To achieve the quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly passed unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... at the time for the prayer was expressed, since some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, saying that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and to their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrine" is what the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike, return.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution is done via other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, as "the people who are asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see the first signs of theocracy in this.”
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"Currently, no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system," appeases Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be an ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, ed. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defense of human rights have called for.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text, which they regard as freedom-threatening.
The fact of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly to the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites within itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Bowing to the holy sites
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all those who bathe in this river receive God’s blessings.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the satisfying of the seastorm and fishing.
Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Believers celebrate the path of suffering here. Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to Christian opinion, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew, from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple, the one by the Romans in the year 70 n. Chr. was destroyed.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies, the Herod of the Great in the year 25 n. Christ had built for his family.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else is taking an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters, the famous ski resort Hermon is located, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting unique museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum. Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most harrowing chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the memorial to the children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And it is heard the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and ocean arias.
Amazingly, the Red Sea also bathes in the winter months, because the water temperature there does not drop below 21 °C and the air heats up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore even carries non-swimmers on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sols) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calmed nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets are held by the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city ran the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda here, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be, according to legend, all hold that touches the walls in the alley with its zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Watchlist for tourists
If you are going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English proficiency: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken in euros, but in dollars, which can simply be changed to shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually make progress by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including changing trains for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and food that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, deep-fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-nourished cats that stray through the streets comfortably and unmolested.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
Insurance costs an additional 15 dollars per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the US and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa requirement on the 9th. February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading in fake allowances
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home country.
On 1. In December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the municipal housing industry and the retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests should become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
You have to take not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both receipt and renewal of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The totality of the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What does the whole thing actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, counters spokespersons for the migration authority, it is a matter of reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a profession, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him in a dark, narrow barrack under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of similar months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, you will be promised the one, and on arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken and will not receive the promised wages," confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Shvaripov.
Don't scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not master the language of the destination country, but can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to be in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "access for unauthorized persons prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly forged and we are not registered, and this then results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Just don't shy away from costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be fake.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That's more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this one costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree on the fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Home Office ignores illegal gun market
Proportion of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the rampage of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
Police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21.
The proposal was supported by the chairwoman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the gun law would be presented to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors - representatives of various weapons associations - demand from the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percent of crimes involving registered weapons is very minor, the criminal lawyer, Vaily Lesnikov, told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from using themselves on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, you can find every possible weapon for little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Home Office stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a web page that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. Weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that order guards are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons that were stolen from both the police armory and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons depots.
Many military camps often caused explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official says.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private armaments factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore squander the weapons under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes craft production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there through the "debt of those responsible who dealt with guns in their work," the report said.
According to the researchers' data, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are due to thefts in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser to a gun shop who doesn't want to be named assures that guns found during illegal excavations have long since been buying no one because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get supplies in a weapons depot.
A gun, for example a gun of the type TT, is purchased via an ensign.
The gun is displayed and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan to uncover crimes, periodically conducts control purchases at traders who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested I get to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," the sales consultant recounts. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and date a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets it be done that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming up with some slap rings about an acquaintance I trust.
He also delivers the striking rings to me only because he knows that I don't batch him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album showing "all sorts of things."
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the sack, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
Neither any papers are needed nor are there any face-to-face meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," reads the advertisement on the website "Buy fighting gun or rifle."
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Ivan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request from "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless sham websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service in the net.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the weapon's hideout," reports press secretary of the nonprofit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless sham websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service in the net.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal firearms, according to experts, prices of 100 to 900 US dollars are to be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Pistol of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons depots of mid-range overseers.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons in the whole of Russia declined by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
In the U.S., fast-food and supermarket workers are on strike
One in four American teenagers sits behind the cash register of Mc Donald's at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests all over the U.S. against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell even further or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-leaning nonprofits.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of setting up unions.
So far, this industry of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the U.S. that attracted millions of customers, which at times led to hand-sets.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, along with unions and left-wing activists, striked branches of the chain whose target group is people of low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the marginally paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain of heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or handheld scanners.
Participants in the protests on "Black Friday" called for wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning US$9.5 an hour could not afford that increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University at Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about. 1.1% more than they donate to wages now.
If Walmart were to completely transfer the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Per year, that would be for them compared to today's additional spending of just 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart are satisfied that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not cause any loss to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in that period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart coffers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post's website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees put down the work and the protest action had merely been "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target, however, was not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city and therefore previously non-existent), but were McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is 7.25 dollars an hour, according to federal and New York legislation.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their ordinary employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars an hour.
No one in this expensive city earns less than them.
How it is possible to get by in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths stood behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the youngsters were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's staff, I constantly encounter people who complain that they have to get along with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began Thursday at 6.30am in the morning outside McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of US$15 an hour, equivalent to more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of that goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high number of personnel turnover.
Unhappy
There were loud protests that day outside many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was a gathering at noon outside the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you're not getting paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also backed by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food staff so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, far from all of them employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be outsmarted moderately so far"
The topic of augmented reality, which is popular with followers of modern technologies, has recently been usually perceived by the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed for a corresponding patent.
Speaking to the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a through-station for the company's scientists.
It attracts the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction between man and machine, but want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck in the phase where pixels are used on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect because they are all interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to a physical level, much is still playing out on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output so far not decisive.
We try to change that, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the general-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all bystanders about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and scarce gestures instead of expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- Like that?
- We would ask you to hand you this bubble can, for example?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can’t do at the particular time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, which will make it possible to capture reactions of people more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are too few, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a controllable processing delay of between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or aggravate the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how that helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that with regard to the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it’s not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think this: The greatest variant would be a “changing” augmented reality, where we could switch from glasses to smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and that is their strength (private can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality with glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let’s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that augmented reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well become the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently still as weak as if someone were blowing over the palms.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, even that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Let it be remembered that it feels what it should feel when it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, that's not how we tried.
Here hides another task that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely to be believed to be a person who is physically in an enclosed space, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms and large spheres.
So far, the brain can only be outsmarted moderately, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg Avant-Garde" project, dedicated to city dwellers who make up the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the exquisite list were already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and which often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the beard dressed in red, who is sometimes found at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous figure of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s, respectively. In the early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up a smile on his fellow citizens' faces through his presence on the street and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently, he grabbed a spinning organ and became a Petersburg organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city, for example?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the grey norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Newsky Palace of Culture where my work was on display.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then the time of the old freelance, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I befriended the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina"; from this "Puschkinskaya 10" was created, and then it was over.
I am drawn to theatre, fashion, music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this united in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists were to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg bohemian, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wearing tight jerseys and among them was the now trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the Art-Klinik.
That's where our staff and regulars went.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the "Personalities of Our City" award.
I won in the "Artist of the Year" category, and with that I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares to be like this.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by pretending that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves to the exterior and not to the inside of the human being.
But maybe you can't shake a man's hand, but spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the dressing up.
- Recently, we saw you in the role of urban organ player. - A city of culture should have a hero like that.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to please.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But there are several thousand to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- To him come abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, consequently there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what I have achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually don't come until the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
With the real Tsars it was different, because the Tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good advisors in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked from the road, as it takes more senior experts who properly evaluate the former and clear their way.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all embrace contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art is difficult to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, just as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth inhabitants on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, does the important question arise as to how we can reproduce in microgravity or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the research associate of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The researchers first dealt with the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before that, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how microgravity affects embryo development.
A normal chick is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it must be able to stand on its feet and start moving," explains the laboratory manager of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid ground, the chicks overturned wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns dulled completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then stopped the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes on the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been sent into space fertilized.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must continue," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their propagation drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Terezhkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered that question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Terezhkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Still, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory at the Cosmonauts' Preparatory Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water enjoyable, it is a foreign environment; yet infants perceive water as a natural element.
It's as if the little ichtyanders were bearing witness to the fact that life on the land was born against the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly in the amniotic fluid for about 9 months, and that he can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
While for a newborn child, zero gravity is therefore a much more natural state, the woman does not manage without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles regress enormously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze the child out also decreases.
All right, let's get around this through birth-initiating aids.
The birth could also take place, for example, in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is Valery Polyakov's not insignificant question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravity, the organism cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a strain suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to give birth to a disabled person, a completely unadjusted person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the inhabitants of the Earth set out in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes the home for their descendants born in space.
NKÚ chief: Control of the black system fails by fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is not the case with us, in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar conclusion apparently also comes to a common control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative practical example, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called. "Black system" on.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with checks - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, hinder in its activity," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel exam that we started about two years ago.
Put simply, it's about European legislature setting out how to handle public procurement. This is what national legislation is based on. Finally, there is the actual practical application.
We compared all this with each other, and although the exam has not yet been completed, we were able to identify extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even a little more "strict and perfect" in our country, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly set new and more precise rules. We also have to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project be a help? What is the result of this project for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and lower and balance thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal as well.
Perhaps it's even that in this way we're just putting a strain on the system with excessive "paperwork," and those seeking gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is structured in a similar way to ours and also has a quorum that is merely formed slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these Courts of Auditors also exist in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state audit courts.
As for German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a role model in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that because the examiners are better there?
I don’t like that, but as I said, I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to cooperate with our authority, would they?
As for the Czech legislation, the significance for your authority was the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, do you feel any effect?
Given that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our examinations.
Since our checks take place retrospectively, a certain delay must be expected here.
We have so far felt the implications rather in the preparatory phase of future checks - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of uneconomicity" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - here the changes will of course have an impact, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the passage of this law rather positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in such a way that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system puts only bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First, let’s say which path is not expedient.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS did not provide the entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called. "Black system" would bother - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, hinder in his activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say we're pretending nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain processes - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to formal errors alone.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
There is occasional ice on the roads, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
Most of the roads are, however, easy to drive, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easily passable this morning, occasionally there was snow and ice.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin blanket of snow remains.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility because of fog.
The R6 expressway and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is required, for example, on bridges on which the roadways are sometimes icy and smooth.
Also accessible are all traffic routes of the second and third road class, including the mountain roads.
On these roads, however, sectionally icy or extended snow residues remain.
Increased attention is therefore particularly required in the higher altitudes.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads of eastern Bohemia there is a danger due to ice smoothness, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes still a stretched snow layer on the roads, the road and highway directorate informs on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially at higher elevations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothness can occur in particular on second and third street routes in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at high altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now easily accessible, but local attention is required, and the driving style is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, ice can occur on the roads.
Locally, fog is also to be expected, but the visibility will improve in the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestrictedly passable, but the road maintenance companies recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131th. Kilometers.
The roadways of the first street class are predominantly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice can be smooth in sections.
The roadways of the second and third street classes are damp, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc district
Today, snow mudsmen must be expected to be driven by drivers who are heading towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snow mud remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow drifting forced the road masters to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of fresh snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the roadways are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk district, there are still remains of snow in the high altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snow in the direction of Jeseník," an employee of the Šumperk road administration told the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to leave at night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet to the high altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, because the roadways are still damp here.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In North Bohemia, the road maintenance companies report several difficult-to-pass road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower elevations, so snow and ice will hold on the roads. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian low mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads there are usually dry.
So far, no traffic disruptions have been reported.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes as well as from the road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec, poor traffic conditions are reported.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the doomsday is to take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people so like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're more likely to make fun of it and say we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which for the 21. December at 11:10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before, i.e. on 20. December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
We not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the doomsday, with the purchase of which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also has the so-called. Hymn against the end of the world entitled "Doomsday falls out" recorded.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will she also resound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn come from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of the Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both of you?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us, and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education center Studeo, where we have been working together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by editors who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you use to select them?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" also planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and we will also be preparing an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - this would also like to combine with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just witnessing in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible for the disabled. There it is still unusual when someone in a wheelchair is traveling alone in the city center.
It is not even a matter of course that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, clubs are also emerging there that are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things in which we hang behind...
In addition, however, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the effort of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks that things really will start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now. But if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and, among other things. Saxophone games, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, is a bit out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; we also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not visible to the outside world, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good proofreaders, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to be able to approach things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we would have to regret.
They are people who live and can develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from a lot of people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
In my opinion, this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have rehearsal twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly extinguishes.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of these were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Just one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You can't prevent that.
Who has the will and the desire to participate, is always welcome with us.

Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as the twentieth member of this space agency. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (to the Czech Republic, which will take place on 12 December. November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s path to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts dealt with space travel, whereby they did not always come across understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld of 6. December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth-facing side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered projectiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents that the research had penetrated to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the von Ing. Rohoziński's design of a photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is in the November issue of the magazine Problemy in 1954, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was foreseeable that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its early days in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the International Federation of Spaceflight, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member as early as the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was made on the 10th. October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
The first RM missiles were followed by the Meteor 1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor 1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B had 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aeronaus Institute developed the Meteor 2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of approximately 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable work.
This decision provoked a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), price tensions occur.
This term is understood to mean a state in which the manufacturer tries to survive economic competition by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" the competition in order to thereby seize a larger market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to shop cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate the overall social economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is particularly evident in changes to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the curtailment of workers’ rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery points for poor people for several years who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, cases regularly occur in which employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum subsistence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of assistants employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as it did in 19 December (as it did in 19. The century was the case, or for a hunger wage on the margins of society, and in the process hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question arises as to where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or the capital remains completely out of the question, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, the employees work for a fraction of the European wages at all.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the point of exhaustion that the state must not participate in its own economy with capital, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its view that the state must not intervene in the economy in a directing manner.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby, ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual favoritism, a legislation in which virtually anything is criminal but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, due to the lack of finance, commissions private legal companies that are closely intertwined with industry to draft bills.
These bills are subsequently passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then ceases to come from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but of strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are rapidly getting into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribe, by unlawful sneaking of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption proliferated unrestrainedly, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "People of character did not apply for office, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" "We really started to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a sole rule, and that a strong man must be elected". Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole rule.
As it turns out, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the reckless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to social interests in society as a whole.
Private capital is not in its very nature in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not in the least striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore determine the cause of the emergence of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in 19 and 20. Searching for century.
Viewed from today's state, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, in which the next round is already looming.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites are in complete ignorance of the future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from the older and recent history.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus reads: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they refer to the Palestinians as terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and refer to the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is more guilty in these recurring waves of killing and who is a victim; ultimately, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
It is about opening the look behind the scenes to the readers, the view of who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are primarily useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people is significantly influencing the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
That which is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who steered their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit to ourselves that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hand of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not emerged within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out in particular, who could be called the head of the Kraken (I don't know if anyone is still above them, but I don't rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
There is not much to write about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was created by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th. Century bought to prevent the connection of her name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which the consolidation of her power, the multiplication of her assets or both stood.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or gearing up for these (before the raid on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the raid on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Ghaddafi, only four remained, with Russia in the meantime in subordinate to its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln declined to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Representative Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global desires for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge, in the years 1859 - 1871.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was intended to break Britain's colonial rule in particular, and the third war is intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for its comforts and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the apron here) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds is working at the top is to trigger a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, so that crises like those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the bankers had the politicians create a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia
End of the 19. For the century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, if possible on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain that the international bankers had initially held him to, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers will succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the forefront of the Middle East, similar to the Second World War, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, exclusively put their own candidates to vote.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone politician loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to ignite a war with Iran, which could quickly expand into a global conflict in the face of Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and in which it could run over the control of Iran over the only 2 miles wide road
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
And it is done that the little ones, and the great, the rich, and the poor, and the free, and the servants, all give themselves a mark to their right hand, or to their forehead, that no one may buy or sell, he may have the mark, even the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has understanding, he thinks about the number of the animal.
For it is number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The movie Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the U.S. after the revolution, who had for decades guarded the patronage of his regime.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a major blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at the hostage liberation only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages evoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the U.S. a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran; in doing so, an extravagant story helped them to cover up their true identity - they traveled disguised with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited filming locations for a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of the genres
The plan, developed by the expert on "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order for the cover to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in trade journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The film draws on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations either).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime novel No Children's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City Without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film not to be set in the director's native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films of this director stood out from the Standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this flair in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entrance sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping reality a bit - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat contrived).
Argo's weakness is his all too broad scattering, which is due to the need to have to show too much of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some traction. It is a film that you follow with a certain interest and the design and the one to a thriller from the 70. Years of reminiscent retro style can gout.
However, he finds it difficult to inspire enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in a certain way today and as proof of how excessive the ideas of the all-powerful and omniscient intelligence services are, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which proclaims a survey of the most absurd bank fees every year, has decided this year, the competition "Absurdest Regulation or Idea to organize from the EU workshop".
"This idea was brought to us by the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said in a statement.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding admixture of bioethanol into fuels, which is naturally harmful, and also the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which eggs became significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also received the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it merely harmonises the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be last year's EU regulation, which, according to balloons at the sale, must be indicated that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of child suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using carnivals.
There are also curious ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who assumes an official function in the EU may not use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankonípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated Laissez Faire alongside the above-mentioned. Absurdities also the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus determined the maximum volume of food stocks that was allowed to be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or from the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will request reimbursement from the EU," the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) declared in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he cited that the grain harvest had been very high and the state camps as a result of the so-called. Intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic to such an extent that it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The municipalities offered the municipalities funding for applications for funding, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically for funding for the setting up of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are easily targeted in the Member States, but the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus also for the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve recognition from some experts.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced in the budget negotiations of individual member countries.
Emotions in this country also provoke the fact that, like other member countries in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this battle.
After a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the designation "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the domestic rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us up to 19. Century goes back, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák."
The term rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham now also appear the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does one come up with the idea of running for the office of president?
It's not about me being a senator or president.
If everything in our country were to work without any problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can't watch the republic being plundered for 20 years, how thieves roam free while people are raised taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm already over 40, and on top of that independently and non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
You made it to the Senate and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Doesn't that how you turn your back on your constituents?
I have told myself all along that I will take up the battle for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the office of president, provided I am elected a senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a people scold the pub and in front of the TV, but we put down anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word to lie with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I was bribed journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have started the battle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide to remain a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or from the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a far greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogms, I can take from any party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more like right-wing or left-wing?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we get on.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You dislike it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the suggestions I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only have keywords.
And you can’t get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you mean that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, to enforce material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to push through these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And those targeted would then have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started with politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can't achieve anything alone; that's why I've talked to several well-known figures about whether they don't want to run for the Senate as well.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, who refused due to work overload.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light heating oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who left have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about this yet because I don’t have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
You're talking about asset declarations, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private wealth at about 60 million. CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few million more in the account.
The Aston Martin, by the way, was a childhood dream - James Bond has always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fighting evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I take on debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; so for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your living?
Didn't you say you're going to scale back these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that remains the case.
As president, however, I would stop my ventures altogether.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a roadside passer-by.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one still volunteers to go to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping city in need of sightseeing just outside Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on the euro bills, as beautifully painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master the statistics: A library must come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the daring bar charts and producer of funny, even often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared for the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin on the face.
And while the jury was still looking around and shrugging with its armpits, the cheeky Meuse stacked up his exquisite souvenirs of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionist underpinned speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is he, my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain, which cost 30 million euros, is poured.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory is richer in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: bookel dorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading are revealed when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant streetlights clearly speak the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already on the lookout for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
Books, books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classic room configuration upside down and turned the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology headquarters.
A special joy are the black bookcases, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes parapets, sometimes staircase railings.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the Standard.
And so we in a Frisian farm one day came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root pad in greenhouses in the Netherlands and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimeters thick plates.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit of a new car and a bit of a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long hike, the Literaturcafé not only offers a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heating and cooling is carried out with geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is under a glass fall, the sun shines only briefly inside even on sunny days.
The wide wood glue binders, which stand transversely to the glass facade, serve as shading and intercept a large part of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already making his way to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as a Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal holdings.
For the time being, this is intended to fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully equipped, currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
And if it's just to the ornament.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in achieving the supreme discipline that is called identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for a Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Does it find it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely its foreign policy that is surrounding its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed, so to speak, by the USA, towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have coherent and consistent policies.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still getting close to their role, but they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean specifically from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had any influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
That is why it must be careful not to bump the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to that either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the US by abstaining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe that there is great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as it was on the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will even earn a certain respect.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly advocated a veto.
Are there any disagreements between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the administration under Obama secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly take this position.
I believe that the actual disagreements are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama isn't so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things forward from their own position.
They are doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany even want to take a leading role?
Or is Germany still having a hard time with the leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany assumes a bigger role, a wide variety of anti-German feelings are released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It has to be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left there?
Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at law firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in intellectual property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters enough to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14. In September 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma trademark protected there, an art name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This refers to women who fish rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch urges.
"The brand is watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the litigation costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because, after the long duration, the complained name had become the "market reality."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The brand office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient staff and room equipment.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the work process has returned to normality".
For example, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still waiting in the office for completion.
To tackle it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth time in a row, the authority said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was charged.
This means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal fabrication of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One has missed this itself, because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the objection of the Munich.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight to this day.
You have to be hellish
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely elaborate and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had to look through even one hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-figure euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much it's worth to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to slosh back to Europe.
That is, when impersonators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, but it was still able to avert the registration.
"You have to be hellishly careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious about doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting, also in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to his brand drama in the last act, then one would probably have to pay the other side royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland, Aidswaisen are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - afflict, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
About fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the house husband.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates.
23.5 million people live in the south of Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fee, school uniform and a hot meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storytellers or praisers on Zulu.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time also brings them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, much of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the whole of Swaziland suffers from the small: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in them, dying in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
On a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to give him a hot meal a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs include HIV, human pappilomaviruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups of stakeholders?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (fungus), trippers and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless: Around 20 percent of new HIV infections are accounted for by this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human pappiloma viruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 illnesses in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
There were about 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a state disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not provide one hundred percent protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the association's chairwoman.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear in time for school lessons every day.
Those who no longer have anyone come to the shelter for Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid for by the association as well as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, you prefer to keep it dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned life form that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would exist at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is different - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together through the south of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know from the times of apartheid at the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also already defied some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice cream on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowy region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit the Mercury.
No one is related to the discovery of ice but to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the finds could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: small peepholes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This image section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, harder to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - called W5 unromantic by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This dazzling ember of a dying star has taken up NASA's sharpener telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made of material that the star hurled out during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Pleiade star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come into their own better.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks towards the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius star image.
His resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular colour scheme.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great enigmas of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, shots of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-split), since dark dust strips three-part the glowing heart of the Star Birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't have technical abbreviations, you may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The fog, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientist UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The Sternenwiege is always producing new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, combined with the rosette fog, constantly produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was mainly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide have been getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, pictured here, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows views into space just above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is tightly lashed at its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting force.
This is because - despite a comparatively small mirror diameter - this reaches to that of the world's largest reflecting telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), anyone computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is to comprise a whopping 42 metres - and assembled from just under 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures are not expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky alongside them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here you can admire an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since the 24. In April 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra-solar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On the 2. In February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space until 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messengers circle far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to revolve around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily - and turn 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the winding road, past densely wooded hills, ravenous rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
Yet this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh live, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azeric and is very durable.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town struts with too powerful architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only single-track.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, arguably the only one in the world.
Here, the Vita of about eight dozen Talysches from the area is documented, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child still conceived
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who turned 122, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate by a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Strikingly many elderly people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
However, due to a lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially since civil status registers were missing.
Every day, melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it is because of the diet.
But the fact that the high-calorie diet of the Talyshes should be so healthy, the meat, bread and especially dairy products and of which many drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long since become grandparents.
Two toddlers are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you can prepare tea for guests, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in row and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out for me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I haven't once bought food in the supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
Yet the cult that is driven around the nation's father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, barely knows any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later taking over the helm from Ilham.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grey son is right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing from the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country's deep division.
The future constitution with Sharia law as a base is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they are all, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, said Mohammed Morsi almost apologetically, temporarily curtailed the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are, the world is not entirely clear.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whittled through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one newly brought article: In all matters relating to Sharia law, Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance in the entire Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, which would de facto result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opposition activists during Mubarak's rule.
After the dictator's overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it says in the draft, protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" "and promote its morality and its values."
This is so inscrutably formulated that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly stipulates equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious, the wording seems that the "insult of people" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
The matter of interpretation, like so much in the draft, which is available to Morsi for signature and, according to his words, will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar Eintracht on Friday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down the charter even before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed of the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "to the garbage mountain of history."
Via short message service Twitter, he accused the supporters of Morsi of wanting to wage a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced they did not want to oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many of the veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Cleanse the land!" and asserted, "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
That's obviously not what Morsi's supporters wanted to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamists' draft is considered certain.
"The word human rights doesn't even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have actually gone by February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chair of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi power expansion to all three forces in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto overridding it," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You are tying a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
That's how you have to imagine the nose-defying smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to go away.
Rakfisk is salt-sprinkled trout, which - depending on how smelly you would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk general."
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," Havard says.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'm tasting some bites.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a quite long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era than there were no cooling options yet and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly under senses subdued with the help of alcohol - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival that was far richer than Norway not so long ago, immigrants are flocking.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, if strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes to buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind that.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident of 22. July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for Norway's wealth today has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and pungent blue eyes.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Their English is just like that of most people here flawless.
We're not very showy, we don't like boasting.
Norway has been very cautious about its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry earnings are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the Great Depression, everyone threw money around them that they did not even own, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and lining up for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the menu again.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can tune for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a bow tie-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the hard haze of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico's future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and his people's mixed feelings.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an always clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected, which blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will be given the presidential tie and take over the nation's leadership.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing Felipe Calderon government, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went on an equal footing with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember it.
Residents of the holiday resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, which works PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party is setting great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway overpasses and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucially urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch of wasteland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During Governor Pena Nieto's tenure, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that itself surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nieto are of the opinion that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her significant other.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs she was beaten, and the body stare had already set in.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is appropriate next to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied to her until now.
The authorities treated me as if I was a chatterer, troublemaker, nag.
They want their judgment to simply be accepted and mouth shut.
"But that's not possible when there were so many formal errors and failings," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential tie on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his tenure.
"I hope as president he is the way he was as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about mistreatment
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is seeking a rejection of the charge based on harsh conditions of detention
The U.S. Army private is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution on Friday tried to establish that Army-free Bradley Manning - charged with the biggest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - failed to face several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained to Maj. Ashden Fein, that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints whatsoever about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard prison term - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then posted by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday's hearing, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he had been in force from July 2010 to April 2011 under heightened prison conditions.
Officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and treatment by the facility as "very professional" overall.
The forms, according to Fein, did not include any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that he was dealing with them. However, they were not logged.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 that was to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observational status to "prevent injuries."
The military testified that it assigned him this restrictive status - which is one step under the risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and getting rid of the observational status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to be able to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once fallen unconscious due to the heat.
Not to be allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrank on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light, which penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and waking guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an allegation he made in his testimony on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to envelop himself with his blanket during this count.
During the questioning on Friday, Manning said he had closed out of an order from his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could have covered. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He would have previously tried to show an official that he poses no danger to himself.
Manning had told the official he could have used the waistband of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not do so.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his detention if he is convicted at his trial in the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges deemed too extreme are to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all detainees kept under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include the enemy's favoritism, unlawful publication of intelligence on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when perplexity spread in me.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues you expect when the minds of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason why Mexicans are equally likely to stay in Mexico these days rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to team up with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war on the drug cartels, even if he did not give details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country's leadership under a gunpoint to leave more than half of their territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official makes even mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - complaints about how Americans are afflicting the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the war path.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge is in truth the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurry sometimes, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped now behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
Yet many Mexican Americans I know feel they belong neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to resume their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as makeshift "ambassadors" for Mexico, which represents their interests in the United States.
We are to tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well, well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem have struck.
Yet even though Israelis and Palestinians appear trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East around them is changing.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate given the current situation.
Even if he on 21. November agreed ceasefire continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the hard-pressed on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his grouping itself has suffered large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are cooped up in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent, regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken sides for Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could face an increasingly Islamist imprint before the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populated and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his 2011 overthrow, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is more in-perfect with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, make an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is unwaveringly sticking to its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence escalations.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the lockdown facilities that run into the West Bank and thus into the bulk of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, but are being expanded further and further.
Netanyahu is in a good position. His Likud party has itself in the run-up to the elections on 22. January under Avigdor Lieberman allied with an even more combative group.
Why do these devious Palestinians also coddle and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, would they not fire rockets, just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them should they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to prevail. But the Arab Spring could make a dash through their account.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in repairing their economies.
That the pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire could be an auspicious sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think more long-term, too.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an impetus from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more rational representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel is ceding territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will grant outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the imminent request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must do his part to persuade Israel to engage in negotiations.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is also averse to involvement.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images that show sick body parts and cigarette smoke-sick infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, will be there from next Saturday.
Australia is thus introducing the world’s strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government assumes studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will not start with a 99% probability even after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on multinational corporations' profits, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has risen enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Court of Australia with their appeal of the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new holdings.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from appearing as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop lying out cigarettes in stores. Now the tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to promote its products can't get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted a rise in testimonials on brands written by "normal people."
One has to ask oneself the question: is this just a private individual who finds such a great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries engage in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'll just ignore them.
"You just take a butt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Frankly, there's only one reason I would quit, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort out a shipment, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're shutting down," he adds visibly angry.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane dropped out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make myself a few thoughts about boredom.
I don't wanna lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us these days are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah. Yeah.
And no. No.
That's what I'm coming back to.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Pompeii's house walls adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory activity, but not be able to do so".
Boredom differs from apathy so that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
Boredom can sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble focusing.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German: "The idle mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The individuals who heard the barely audible television said they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble focusing, could find no reason for these and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or exhausting task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one carries out a monotonous activity - "just like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children allowed to hammer around learn more and retain more information than those forced to sit still," according to Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a booming loudspeaker, a particularly tiresome movie.
But some people are more bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to susceptibility to boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements can be found such as "A lot of things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys become boring more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and in doing homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
Yet only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen or decreased in terms of boredom.
However, he is sure that "the youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what best to do right now.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you get happy.
But television can cause happiness in the short term, but these evaporate again in the long term.
So if you extend an iPad to your bored child, you can take it off the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from the constant activity and technology sprinkling.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the excruciating, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to keep busy once the noise has fallen silent."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a misdemeanor that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - cavalier offenses, each with a penalty of US$100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for own use, the response in hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of administrative offences that revolve around marijuana are already dropped here and in Washington, the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities are no longer tracking adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative counties have announced plans to pursue existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver's suburbs to the Western Mountains, are voting on preventing new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation continues to develop so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching the head at a help.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and in doing so have a deadline of 1. December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, one thinks that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation. There, the drug was legalized first for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Singaporeans' supervisory authority in Washington state.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes place on 6. December in force and thus also forms the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions must be clarified during this time - for example, how the state requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis transactions within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities is to be agreed.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recent research group.
On 21. November, Chief Oates emailed his associates in Aurora explaining that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21, and that police "as of now" will not seek criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce city guidelines to regulate medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he indicated his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been charged for other offenses.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were crimes at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer displaying adults for owning smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state brought to light a profound discord among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who is representing defendants on the trial for marijuana offenses and acts on the spot as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting individuals for still not being able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials prepare for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offense.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several eye-catching arrests from consumers and medical marijuana vendors, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while crime investigators are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they will presumably resist to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for federal agencies to act.
Even before Election Day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana stores, though these could not open until about a year from now.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban that is likely to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," according to Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
We are guided by what the municipality has chosen and not by what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
It's not just university students today who are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the world's greatest stamp of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my move into Worscester College in the late 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I had left because I would have had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously declared that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran, because I was suffering from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my now-defunct father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of the moderate rights are suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford, meanwhile, has developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal equality protection that benefits gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) state they are "often actively isolated, personally assaulted and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They are calling for a place on their college's equality committee to ensure their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which portrayed Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazi.
In it, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and boasted silver-colored suit and silver-studded walking stick, among others, was shown.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham's conservative student association, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend at universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the conservative Oxford student association, says she has observed a growing rejection among JCR members over students of the moderate rights.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to award Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even spooked Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, during which new students get to know each other and the tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miner's strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the timber-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was to write French texts from 18. Translate century into English. I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on that.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake dough, and quite spiteful.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were giggling.
In my eyes, tears were rising.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt sniffed at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone easily tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first-year students pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I do not do on all points with Mrs. Thatcher agreed.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically attended Eton College, who was considered a conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my mind to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who revealed himself openly as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-minded, and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic perspective of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, small-mouthed.
They would never do anything like this, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, at which another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly smashed with shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing," and called them "old suckers."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You are welcome to call me a whining slack.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture," which opened in London this week, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This is what the designer acknowledged at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture were put together, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the stuffy and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is still until 3. March will be on display, there will be a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, ranging from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from humble fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't step out their butts on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as e.g. B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a Valentino dress
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All the invitees felt important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began her career at the 1995 haute couture week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are artwork," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good upbringing and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long catwalk that suggests a role swap: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" that wears masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristótele's Onassis, the costumes that Monica VittiEe.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget for the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I was living in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress by Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20. Century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society."
Turned for years with the elite's "savoir-être," Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honor, cumulating Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his peace, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must descend every day to the bottom of his crater, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at the turtle tempo, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresomely heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has exploited the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is what she then sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who usually does three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid on the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the line for three years at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left the first traces on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-sufficient young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also pours out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
The shadows challenging, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets on their shoulders with sulfur on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulfur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier spre use.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stocky, 42-year-old carrier who has worked for three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and pinches the miners in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious illness ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, at 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, at the age of 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty endures generation to generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: that of those who work as human donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame for not having children, on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child-rearing.
“The people of Singapore need to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candies, but nevertheless - or precisely because of it - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song that reads local sayings such as e.g. B. "Pushing a "bao" (loaf) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the commercial will reach out in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproducing, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it is a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as B. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
Therefore, we thought: Why don’t we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as B. Composing a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this issue easily are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends US$1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the national population authority, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have substantially more options in terms of life goals and set priorities, except to marry and form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay of marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
So it already has an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they are deterring the construction companies from building large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This causes them to be much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were previously placed obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, it can be seen from the conversations with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district that they will not have much effect.
"People are severely stressed, the apartments and also the upbringing are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"For me, it's important to have my own money and time," says another, roughly twenty-year-old man.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and cost of ownership and upbringing as reasons they cannot have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't announce in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the importance of "privately" in web pages like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is clear that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or of insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he states.
Asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommends him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he states.
According to the boy, no one made him hint or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone is oppressing me or asking them to do it from me, I'll just remove it from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences that are now known as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He only did it in private."
After that, he explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe him one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, thinks that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for the search for information; but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, when we are still learning ourselves," he said.
He explains that it is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what is allowed to spread, publish or be said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They're also supposed to be picky when they're most important to being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the professional, the most effective way to teach the children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that makes them think.
"To tell them not to do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you would not tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like it when you publish a photo of you, like the one you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are posting about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you have labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational counselor, comments that it is imperative that parents carefully read through the guidelines of the social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you are allowed to share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6. Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the signed document with the VI. To obtain a proper meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources at the State and Presidential Chancellery initially said they would hand it over after the exam, but explained afterwards that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
In case of questions about the text, they stated that the content was set out by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio."
The little information circulated among the journalists was obtained from the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets calling for more information.
After that, the President of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document at the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III. Summit South America - Arab States (ASPA), and also on this occasion, despite strong calls by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can see for yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were in place for the journalists, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries.
Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process that Lima launched against Santiago, to hear the pleas from both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently making to this international court of justice," Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," Piñera adds, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia filed an action against the Bogotá Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit meeting were the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been banned from prison since 2011 after the deposition of his president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit meeting in Lima shortly after lunchtime.
The Head of State read out the final document, which said that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were established over an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said measures would be pushed forward to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organised, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant features, but should serve to expand our production output and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial connections in South America, and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, which would be on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations," which it is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasised at the summit.
With that in mind, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the ICJ questioned by Bogotá.
"Possibly I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusionary, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is chairing the regional bloc.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually being able to learn something from Europe."
Correa, the one on 6. Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) attended, which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "killed in World War II and in other clashes" and "are virtually a fatherland today."
In that sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that pushes the member states of the inasuran.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that are seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the resolution of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign everything for the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he declared, referring to the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there had been "substantiated assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had demanded that he be subjected to an interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offense, while "the Swedish case law allows this by means of a video conference, which could have been carried out through the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be affected.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," Ecuador's head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a confined space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since the month of June at the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free pass, with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a number of proceedings on various European authorities," he explained.
And "if Britain grants this free pass tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish case law allows and was made in other cases, the problem was settled.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, evil intention and lie that invalidates free speech."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and pervert politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and also not by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election he will "deepen the revolution to continue on the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow any opportunism and not to grant any coup as legally disguised" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call on international authorities if both countries commit to accepting the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
Regarding the possibility of him standing up as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he indicated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 election, he would retire from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill that responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He has told me that he has traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health condition in any case," he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state took today in Lima on 6. Summit of Union leaders of South American nations (Unasur) attended by the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The reason for a death due to AIDS is today a too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the result of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "too weaken" without discernible success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he was just his 43. Birthday celebrated.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported in April this year by a prestigious scientific publication.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs would have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 can easily turn 75 years old in this sense as long as they are under control," this professional explained.
In order to be able to correctly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients enrolled in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to the antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the individuals come in a far advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all people who need it need to be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS avoidance in Jalisco) agree with this proposal and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason that it had made a friend of his, who despite his young age was already in the AIDS phase and even the cancer
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, then rather burst three times," one says in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," enumerates Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the worldwide AIDS day.
You should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this purpose, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously handed over individually, now they give us parcels with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the risk individuals for new infections are the adolescents.
"Why do you need this?" is a common mocking question from social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms are to be located not only behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
It is not to be paid to them the beer and motel, as the governor, Emilio González, responded to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in a sexual activity," he put it in a nutshell.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally based on 4. Place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and at 13. Place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal upheld a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s liabilities reached through a trade st bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the land of the stars and stripes in contradiction to international agreements.
In practice, it leads on 15. June issued recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that the Mexican companies are helplessly suspended from the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door for the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit's appeals court, based in New Orleans, initially says that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for insolvency of cross-border companies is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Act for the Standardization of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a conciliator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate which the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed among companies in the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Bankruptcies).
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as e.g. B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have run out of 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country beatings.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects before the same court of appeal so that the vote is in the plenary, i.e. from all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare opposition will be lodged, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Frind of the Court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described under the Act on Trade Exchange, and which indicates that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It also points out that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the established rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow to Vitro and to the country.
General balance sheet
After the complaints by the Mexican air transport unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, failed to advance for several months, the Asociación Sinden de Pilotos Aviadores (Trade Union Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The application, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Principal Administration of the Republic of any transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of the Bank IXE in the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the manufacturing industry) has achieved to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental facility, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, which is known by the English abbreviation ACTA, has not complied, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, even though the Senate had overlooked the possibility because it viewed it as a violation of free speech on social networks.
Homex long-term
In a drive to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is placing stock market certificates on the market of over 500 million pesos.
The issuance is the first of four equal issuances that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Formed by the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the country's history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, first national league player, plenipotentiary and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball federation.
"All my life I put on a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those reminiscent of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-managing director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-managing director or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very vigorous and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would make for another.
He was granted the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but already from a distance, because he was already the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the US.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, in which we finished fourth, which should have been bronze if it hadn't been for this Canadian referee to repeat us the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as are those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American Games 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
That team was back not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the incidents at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal contrary to every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill from the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else are you left to do?
There are things I would have put in, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce z. Play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and every now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21. Born in Forth Worth, Texas, in September 1931, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family news release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved native city of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He gave joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Bezauberde Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He was also a performer of two comedies that were only broadcast for a short time, such as B.The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included critically highly-rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in their environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was to create an expectation for an episode full of emotion, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
Thus, the series reached a record viewer at that time.
When the response became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave the city. But others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) instructed.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, fellow actress of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts to us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was complete, and a sixth chapter was just being shot, the broadcaster informed.
From Warner or from TNT, there was no immediate explanation of how Hagmann's loss in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm someone or interfere with someone in any way," the Associated Press said at the time.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and after that," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as e.g. B. "Don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you're going to be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course, which studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as e.g. For the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long backward count" on 21. December, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, whom some have called "deudarmagedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzed what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, it would be a really good period.
And he reminds that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer this semester, which should actually be the last in history, classes on the "end of the world."
In Temple, the associate Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as e.g. For the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I've tried to educate students about what's possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a co-owning professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple designation "The End of the World."
"We're not taking 2012 so we always keep the option to be able to hold the course again in case the world doesn't go down," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent demise," students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to "continue working until the night when the world is supposedly coming to an end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places," Restall said of his high-average student course, which filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains to having seen all the apocalyptic films.
"Never have I heard anything about a class where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less so a professor - explained, to the last date of the 21. To believe Decembers.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has increased these speculations.
"Elsewhere people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly responds to the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a reprieve from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken by the last court, and said that if on the 21. December nothing happens, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that the 21. December is the beginning of a seven-year period, according to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they would like to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student of communications.
