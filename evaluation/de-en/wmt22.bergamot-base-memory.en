The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value test....
I am #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should attach the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs €179.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order it again for the better price or is there another option to credit?
I also find that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help for a moment, bring the bottle etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best measure whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title partout doesn’t want to come to mind anymore, someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a small niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before each suicide to go and document the place of suicide and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip, which suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death with intent)
This one faces fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there's a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this plot is familiar to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for WiFi available.
Have to contact my husband first.
But that may take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it possible to get the price difference back?

Very difficult to grab.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
More and more Omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Eve.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the coronavirus booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers than previously sought.
Every adult in England should already be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why the vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let yourselves be boosted now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a whopping 65 percent increase. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm all in favour of introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter" but a slightly more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over the feet of an official.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one thing I bought today is not possible
Obviously, the chair had an unsignificant shortage on sale.
How can such an upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only on the #PRS_ORG.
But that has been working since about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want to add that you 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something a little bit detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about my soul.
I (21) am more likely to come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately seems far too common is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or we think we could not help them.
I realize that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, afraid of snatching the children out of this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help with that in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the good for the series to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning make-up: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was relied on.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with the review of the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, it did not settle - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
Even more than the naked result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
Representing a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way quota was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in a three-person attempt - still questions?
John Patrick said: “We were just not focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and we didn’t implement what we trained.”
Namely, moving the ball.
Quite another, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like it was in front of 10 000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money’s worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts that marked 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team, even the top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to fight.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I got in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally got in touch half a year ago.
Always like out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good afternoon, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official instruction" to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent season must also be cancelled, as it is called on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to make up for their appointments, which have already been laid in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12. December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of comedian harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das nicht problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and based on etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear happiness" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as it was demanded in Berlin in a referendum.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in the tenancy law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed by Kentucky tornadoes
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the U.S.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the USA caused serious devastation and possibly caused up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long trail of devastation, especially in the limb state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tornado had raced through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that's even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the limb state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she is sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's a shame.
Will it still be produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, only I can order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or gave up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this arrived or is being processed, because I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government further rejects the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees cash rewards for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - following the German model - should also increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he blasphemed over.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please include the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm gonna make a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I am currently running the adventure About the Griffenpass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts come up and now I'm in the process of writing the entry-level adventure and stumble on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a carriage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There, the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is said to be waiting for a group of goblins and luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in a variety of ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early on, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with arches and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins lurk on the hero in a hollow path and flank the carriage armed to three left and right arms, while two with spears stop the carriage.
Should it come to the battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think of Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start with the adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to heed many of your ideas and now have more faith in my narratives.
I've made the lamp apart again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then let the return slips come, I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to make myself a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was canceled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and the starting accident was the schedule far behind the planning, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, for legal reasons, the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a lack of rule in the F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen is allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should just know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV station.
It is also not the first guesswork, which is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, do not like the articulated comment style of Roos, but admit that this is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillines, both of which simply make it seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take this seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over on Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to manage without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very poor and full of reruns.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, with the exception of advertising, RTL does a better job at the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To this: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me it's being sent out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable, so that you can connect several vents.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump, it is also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (can be found in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like to name.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outflow or similar by means of an air hose 4/6 mm... and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher as the water level and be attached outside.
If the fan pump is lower like the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water running backwards that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, it is packed daily and the parcels are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is out of tune just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in freight forwarding... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is due exclusively to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,... they're having a damn hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in bright?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and land the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly crowned astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Among the applause from friends, family members and staff from Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space in 1961 as a Nasa astronaut, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor to the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket each, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometres above Earth as a border with space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned all-out: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy chief executive of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and also in the laboratory standing does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about job prospects before studying, but also at the time that I would like to study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
So I would really be interested in:
1) As what are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really uncertain at the moment and may be considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and training to become an IT specialist.
If you have any experience, please write them :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why only now a post for it.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, it's also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies will have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what went on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *necessarily* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be?
Or because people all seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also mightily annoyed.
What is this self-hostage about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is simple: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the party by baking cookies with her son and crafting.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts, I finally have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the moults and the formation of plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moults are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
GDR manual model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway company ME issue 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which is designed for theCompany ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally refurbished
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive, which was to be able to transport 2,200-ton-carbon passenger trains and 530-ton passenger trains with a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this line.
The top speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the supply as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with AEG drive with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which received the company numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as a reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The reappraisal of all six locomotives was determined in the Dersau Reichsbahn repair shop.
[4] When the increase in the demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service was developed as the medium-German network progressed, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were processed in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger quantities were preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable in the case of the E 94 that the number of reprocessing could not be further increased did the E 95 come into focus of the reappraisal.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the Halle P railway works unit in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
So it often happened that gunmen stuck during switching actions.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to release the shooter again with a hammer and wooden wedge while driving.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter genres, so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one more, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, the last to follow were the E 95 01, which was held on 5. October 1970 the service acknowledged.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were disassembled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future E 77 10 museum locomotive as a turnout heating system on the main station in Halle.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external reappraisal of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it for a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a museum locomotive that is not operational.
In 1986 the inner completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is supervised in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint finish, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusted, with play marks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small support - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and stock marks.
Yes, the F-parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The center beam is held by two feet..sadly, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do now?
I can't build the bed.
The center bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center bar does not fit into the provided bracket.
So I'm gonna get new ones sent.
When will they be sent?
No no shallow.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the mold, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I receive these?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday, according to the data.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To invalidate fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his corona vaccine.
A friend's illness has moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was reportedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the Linkedin network on Friday.
“For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been hanging on to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
“However, the most common cause seems to be anxiety, which is often stoked by misinformation and suspicion.”
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own data.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to manage without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire went out on Friday evening with 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency generators had been in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for the tireless operation," Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, said in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, because the Westnetz-Monteurs could initially only temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company.
Electricity flows again
The fire, which broke out on Friday at around 19.15 clock, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear, according to Westnetz in the substation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There, complex cleaning and repair work is necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 21:30.
Since 23:15, the last affected by the failure would also have electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
Authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday lunchtime.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of the elderly or single people in their neighborhood and communicate to the local fire department equipment stores when help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of old people’s homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary childcare places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 of them.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them into each other and thus shorten them.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I would have to send her back, otherwise she will not be suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it that way!
send me the return slip by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
You want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We don't agree with that
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in eastern Otepää.
Once again, the duo had to give themselves up to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country ski trail with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both remade s and use version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard of problems many times
Have directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, oother!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrectly reported to Customer Service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
In order for the paint application to become even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry them.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly line next to line.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve true to the original appearance through the decals or Decals.
From sovereign signs on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates for car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each required decal individually and set it up.
Decals are also called water sliding images because you briefly moisten their backside with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then you only push the picture a small piece of the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away on the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is sitting properly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkles or even tears.
Suck out excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else I do not read the book and have to unregister and register and reload the book and find the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this one by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
OK still thank you!
Then I will buy somewhere else once the money is back.
But can I get that back without any problems?
Perish treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, it suddenly puts itself across.
In turn:
We had applied for the fertility training in advance at the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the assumption of costs at the PKV and were granted another 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than agreed, logically count the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insurance claim.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "the insurance claim begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts are made) or we (it is 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that with one birth the further trials expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them again
All right. All right.
We will order nothing more from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything for the dresser to arrive completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they're not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty for 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A**low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you
Sincerely
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position... I will give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
'Half victory' against Belarus associated with high cost to EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus does not give very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not turn decisively against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It apparently cannot prevail if a member state puts itself in the head to do its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt at border crossing
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested during the night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border lockdowns.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being in power in Minsk of attracting her with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take domestic political costs into account.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protest after controversial Formula One final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula One final, Mercedes have appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken him irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had still overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'm gonna check this.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
Europa-Park, the namesake for the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.

In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains lit up red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," according to the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga and the theme park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
To see radiant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirm this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord" author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.

I gave up the contact form to return an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
It doesn't everyone have the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our household.

Sorry but only because he says he is not an anti-Semite means nothing.
It's like when a afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Giving your i will not be both.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
Yes wow then you are as seriously as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely lost.
Because of me, one God got the whole thing going.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just tapping nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and no longer serious about taking it like Kollegah
To maintain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of defects and color errors into the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification data.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (in German and English available).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations at the fir sale.
Once, a man is said to have even gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little fun, he says.
And the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate this accordingly!
We do not need to have any discussions here about the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both therefore have their name.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "turner," which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble building a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out a fine 50 Mbit except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, on the other DLan module, which the Wifi sends out, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I get away in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optics so much Internet speed is "lost" via the power line?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to still lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really despairing, which is why I created an account here.
That's why I'd be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought that now would be quiet in the current accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to be confirmed with all sorts of tricks by their customers the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin against this regulation even got right.
Now it is already being debated in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper instances also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the head of Hollywood.
But their lives are like an uphill and downhill.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
For her, who caused a furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the sequel to her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Her appearance is taken care of by an entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans are still flying to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with happiness - and still seeks the great love.
And removed the baby's request from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport premier class.
As a farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in the Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60. World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the double bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated this, I would have to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he fought off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, in which he drove from third place to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds left.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also received his 22. Victory in series.
Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth after finishing second this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after fourth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first podium finish this winter in addition to her Olympic qualifier.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me with me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not only pushing, but there is also an enormous amount to do around it".
Jamanka was annoyed by the not-completely error-free journeys, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore I couldn't redeem why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had very different problems last year and never time for it.
And now it was he's expired, which upsets me very much.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing so long delivery time on your website
No only when I type on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered Way.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it goes one - or others so...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has a burn 2. Grades brought on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
It is also cold and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very troubled with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child is having a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and strokes for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework coming to us, which we naturally divide up.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is quite well adjusted right now, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is asking for a lot (for me) right now, tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not yet done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what happens next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Just until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, does the whole thing go on?
Just till the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll pack that.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Are you like that too?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this has some to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought to myself that I'm sure I'll find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order Today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has impression.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to swap the table now I'll get other color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them such as math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell of work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But if it was also strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Maintain culture or something?
Hope you don't have question too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write English I understand that well
That's been a long time, then I'd refrain from it
It's good, thank you.
I expect feedback in a timely manner, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
First, modernity (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom in order to be able to live myself I mean.
The transition is also the soldier's grave site.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that tells you something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on his stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax. Relax.
A child like that can stand much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but not minutes of monitoring.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when they sleep.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it straighten up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face in front Directly in the mattress?
You can tell if everything is okay.
We also all grew up and when my husband was born, it was egg and there was that you put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "master customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my closet that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I would ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
It is just that the politics of this channel are now under all sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don’t want to be “a running advertising column.”
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising station that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rooms tries to make ash.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a recall call, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach pain or just for cuddling – My little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and release it in a metered manner.
The removable inner cushion is easy to heat in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical smell, stick or burn spots and immediately dispose of them if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the source for heating beforehand!
In the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. Heat for 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer’s information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, the surface can cause slight moisture formation, but this disappears during repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that a heating of grain products is allowed in the instructions for use of the manufacturer.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) check your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, and in people with reduced pain sensation.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose seeds leak, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents arising in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after hinseries second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table basement.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well under the third coach either.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and approx. 3 years old) no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is enough to operate.
Missing message, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
You have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can’t I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don’t know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 liters of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still giving it into second-to-second access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
There is a locking hook made of metal with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various “filling levels”: there are 4 anchor beams, stable riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to dig through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-use carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# has me yesterday an email for confirmation of the commissioning of the
Contact announced by the freight forwarder to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
I have not received a message so far.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
It is foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him that way is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you so much for the help

Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not have guessed and could not redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are suitable for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the properties of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic characteristics of our tuned windows underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, collect horses and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues so as not to go bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with plenty of ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that “works more and more” for you (so-called “Engine Building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional promotions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California obtained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players alternately perform actions, such as gaining resources, moving chariots, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunsling.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, so has covert every location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are superior to the bandits in number, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
In the case of free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, goods shipment (games included).
With everything else usually insured DPD and with tracking (games foiled, wrapped with tile and packing paper).
If you are a collector then I can also ship cardboard in the carton for an extra charge of 2 euros, which does not come to 100% pressure points.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Media Library
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and parenting rights activists are now making serious accusations against him.
​Please take care of yourself, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible people must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide omission of the testing obligation for triple vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when for three times the testing obligation can be omitted," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, told the "Bild am Sonntag."
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged that "he will make a proposal to the Conference of Ministers of Health next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account details.
What can this be?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 to 1000 up.
The most common way is to hear noises/voices, less often to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the abbrending.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia preliminary interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but had ** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read her comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ does not help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they were just delivering to the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had put a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
He later wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man is getting older".
The harrowing diarium of a slow farewell to the world that the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I already testify to my life thanks here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used as load carriers, especially in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallets Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not charged
New York wins MLS Championship for first time
New York City FC has won the major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roulades Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a cattle ranch for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can do that
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by mail that the refund was made.
But to date, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days such as the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get another Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and the distortion.
Above, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even float a performance reserve if it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 footswitch, you can also easily call up the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With his new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it that way with others.
Can you send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I do not need are a little much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
Progress is emerging in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear deal, according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that are supposed to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revitalize the agreement had continued after almost one week of interruption.
The negotiations will be attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
The only federal state is the value above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the mark of 1000 at the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new contagions with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported within a day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it?
I do not have to click/indicate/fill in here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is, in my eyes, a cheekiness.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What the post here for?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, you can tell one thing: It is not extistent.
We have come into a winter rigidity and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction of how some things have gone here and how we generally represent.
In the last few days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here still have a buck on the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is in demand, which one wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found one, simply said, shambles.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who feel like rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* What existing regulations need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we perform to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but that’s not bad, we have the discord in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with it and let's decide democratically on the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/chunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I was taking the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to make it happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, probably rarely eats meat at the moment.
I was a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal cruelty.
So my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that dissent came on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and she knew where her meat came from and that a vegetarian was animal suffering reduced.
Now I wonder if my answer was too “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put in a corner as a vegan and conflict arises without you putting it on it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clear not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
You do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I'm not on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return not on site.
Since I cannot be there because of a funeral, this cannot be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date, please.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment truck water rescue of the volunteer fire department Lahnstein to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects permanent increase in operations: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations in sync, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's the case.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for giving yourself to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also arms carriers in the executive, I do not want to go into further detail!
I always find the question of right and left as a matter of simplification.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, in the special uniform and arms carrier, attracting people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can of course not deal with the lived reality difficult, of course, because of course you have in addition to the average white, now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean now the exaggerated feminine cliché gays, because these are in the executive rather less to notI have to leave because in case of doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even if these marginal groups are also represented when it sounds funny in my experience a conservative attitude, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or means to please them, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but that they are openly allowed to speak their minds there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially policemen and soldiers who were often deployed abroad often start to flat-rate due to negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing comrades of mind certainly meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I do not understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German page.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black still to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (am independent, very little free time), but all my life I get to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and every now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really like “someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, but it bothers me somewhere but mostly household just loses to work and displeasure.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get more neat with child?
We don't have one to work on yet and this question has been on my mind for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have completed an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have now been trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem is that I have a self-confident (or Anchorously avoidant) personality disorder (AEPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have relaxed conversations and I have been told many times that I seem aloof (but I think I have already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the specific day-to-day work is really what I imagine it to be, and it’s difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already the easiest things are fucking") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it""/I keep him from work with my stupid questions"/"he really has to think of me as a minor"
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to have it mentioned at this point.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean to give back please!
If I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its own protein substances from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in nestling and the formation of ground in the whizzing bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal are associated with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disorders in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, it was intended to be used again for daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON organic on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is only advisable to prepare as much drinking water/soft feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, twice or three times the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be added at the beginning until the approach of ground new formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is passed until the ground formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I emailed on Monday to announce that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in re-admonition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So case application made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert review.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have one so only without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check this?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident at Selb

Ah okay understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
First, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just decommoning everything you can think of.
Before I get out of here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with the teaching profession and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other job advertisements".
And it's only been around for half a year.
At the times before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still pivot.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now there are vacations, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my after-hours my end of work.
I had free time.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that further annoy me.
Basically, it is fun and viewed from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if he doesn't do that already.
I wonder if I want to have this the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of yours here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and together in a team what was worked out and not as a lone fighter like that is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if I didn't get back to the same place in a year as I am now and am dissatisfied.
You realize it’s all kind of confused, but maybe you have advice or ideas as outsiders, how I come out of this situation, which I’m completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and excuse the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become clear at least a little.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously developed, which has led to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers with an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply better manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which has again led to a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum variety of sounds here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stroke, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determined the tubular character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adjusts to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
One possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for photos.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused major damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, at 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not continue to venture a prognosis when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state-run TV station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 residential homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That's equivalent to nearly 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants lives directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was seriously affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the gesture of gift-giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gifting.
Previously, gifts were handed over in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into her window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom, popular in Germany, emerged, to fill the boots especially of the children with gifts.
Protestants joined this custom because they reject mediators between God and people as "sanctuary worship."
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions, it only annoys very few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the custom of Martinssingen and Martin parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources have shown a tradition of gift giving since 13. Century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful buddy on the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer and the favoring of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by police on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who is said to have gone to a bank and a bookmaker's business with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officers a little later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth skewers.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used all year round in outdoor use.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly in color.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and foundlings, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself great preparatory work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any supply line or batteries.
Place the »luminous stone« at any place illuminated by the sun on the day.
Two supplied earth skewers ensure a firm hold if required.
The matt white plastic sleeve itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the case.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« begins to shine automatically; in what color, you determine for yourself: six attractive light colors are available for you – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off is also automatic as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from scratch the next day.
I've done that several times it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again, because I have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases, which I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 on my last about two-year break and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it put a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without dryness, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, gynecologist did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is yet to come.
Many thanks to everyone:n who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertär bad atopic dermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule lichen and the acne topic.
I also have nutrition in the course of chr. Disease tries everything possible and has stuck to sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It may also be good that Hormonally simply the worm is in it, but if you have like me everywhere construction site you prefer not to look for more what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what has been answered to my request.
I always have to work and get on the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But it generally exists in large
Since it is available in black large

In the name of the people: Lay people make judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothes.
But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear a robe: Schöffen determine with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.

110 kV earth cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Thanks for the message
Why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the request to #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems planning my teaching in the field of geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so that I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can only copy for free (which is annoying for earthy education).
I need a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually have every hour of their own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest excessive time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this (most of the time I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe I can have a geography teacher how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to complete the return as soon as possible.
Trade fears because of the 2G regulation for Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovering are allowed to recover.
The trade thinks this is unnecessary and complains of revenue slumps.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-daily demand, revenue slumps are to be lamented, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Things only work well in food retail and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, the chief executive said.
"2G when shopping does not take us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel deployment.
The ribbon scheme must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the received ribbon on that day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find and get solutions approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors can, for example, at a central location in the center once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame is also a mistake that has been tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiance angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply by pressing one of the memory keys for a longer time is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation is again when the new switch-on is switched on - Very practical during studio work, for example, if the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can directly attach to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
This is also included in the scope of delivery of a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it is too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in series winless Hesse were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga bust.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration of a mixed start to the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN, speaking out a "lump sum praise, to every single one who was involved."
Initially, it looked like another damper for the Frankfurter, who are now in ninth place, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkuseners in the lead with 2:0 left.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his team-mates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," the 27-year-old said, delighted with a look at the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we were trying to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go on step by step and stay humble" and "go through the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on Wednesday in the course of the English week.
I will get the mail that my package will come back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would for me then unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women sneaked off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and blank glances.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now score against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," national coach Henk Groener said.
Against Spain we have to perform differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second behind the Danish women (10:0) with 8:2 points.
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game of all that we have to erase," captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, against the World Cup runner-up of 2019 next Tuesday, a significant increase must be made to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in the defense," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not on the up with the kick-off.
Misses and technical errors in attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 backlog after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-kick.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game at 3:10 after 20 minutes had run early, especially since back room player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game a little better and at least five goals until the break.
The already only quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at the 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer gain an increase in performance and went off the floor as a clear loser.

Does that work for them?
The title is available, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly inoculated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon finished to a large extent, it goes on for me in part in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to one personally (e.g. "I take medication X, get along with the vaccination.").
My area of responsibility includes the information for the vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination order and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have no vaccinations, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but who can not (may not carry out vaccinations?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, submitted by an Amberger, the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained untermaked by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "person who's nervous."
And also no one "who has to go fast."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment in many Upper Palatinates.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, somehow derived from the rather well-known dialect word "houdern".
What closed an education gap - probably also with some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
The following error message always comes after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Choice of tyre in road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in the coming week to prepare for my bike tour.
Said, done and I was riding my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what lurks in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to participate in the rest of the track anymore.
Since I had no real opportunity to get myself a spare coat and spare hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around again with a halfway bad mood and take home the first track.
Was not so bad in terms of mood, maybe it is better if I practice again before the bike tour with the tire change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires of the previous owner (very nice old man, has on the day I came to pick up the bike until 14 o'clock 120km) and who had already called them suboptimal, because he has ridden with them for several years on roll.
But if I think about the fact that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I am in a really bad mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me wonderfully why I did not have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unflattenable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike at the moment.
They also exist (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a road bike to other tires?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Lay knowledge more recommending the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car hurls against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had bounced on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a central island and then on the oncoming road, the police announced.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man trapped in the car.

After the release of our new High End wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed foot is directly included to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such a high sound pressure level almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and for its size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high-frequency climb.
This is generally customary in the case of broadband bands in order to optimize the bundling which is greatly increasing to be excessive.
Exactly aligned to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound pattern can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that its same is looking for.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If you want to veneer the housing, for example, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the aid of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the picture “Detail Bevel”.
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls in front of you on a flat surface.
On these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in the thickness of the material if required, provided that you want to use finished strips from the hardware store instead of producing them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole saw or a forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking out/blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and unabridged cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm bore into the foot up to the terminal opening and leave it there approx. Stand out 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and it is also allowed to hang out loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and used.
The blueprint of the crossover and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can let hot glue drop on the opening and thus close.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed tight with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people by shift, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still pandemic – yet we’ll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Put yourself cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
