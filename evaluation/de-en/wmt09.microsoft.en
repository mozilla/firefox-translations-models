The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the red towards the close of business.
After the steep drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued Monday's slump right at the start of Tuesday trading, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the slump was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, this reflects the market's reaction to the result of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of equities in Asia
Equities on the Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the course of the business day, but was later able to make up some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the bill to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries would also be affected by the slump.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK) should be spent.
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indices posting their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar slump it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as there were signs that the bill would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government is allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
This is due to be voted on early next week.
American lawmakers achieved a breakthrough in talks to adopt a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) of financial assistance to the American financial system.
However, this does not mean victory.
Members of Congress still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various sources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before doing business in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a congressional decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute due to a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo some changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not doing its job, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush assesses progress in negotiations positively
The president has a veto over this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remains, which was based on obtaining finance to buy bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate should be able to vote on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, completing perks and a timeline for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very this and made a lot of progress toward an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also anticipates help for homeowners who are struggling to repay their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys, with the goal of reducing monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
In Marek's view, whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not decisive.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree to support the plan and that they pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to adopt it is the most important thing at this moment," Marek emphasized.
Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria brought about a noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously hanging in the balance.
In contrast, the returning officer of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democrats (SPÖ) remain the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP fared even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the case of the People's Party, which called for early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
Voters, however, probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's executive committee.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated, when the People's Party had reached agreements with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) regarding a joint government.  which had even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects a return to Austrian federal politics, is obviously counting on this development.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not enter parliament.
Duel on a knife's edge: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy yourself a phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why you should get an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
Surely you hardly buy a great expensive record player for your home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
For once, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music when travelling, i.e. with compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3 format.
Again, there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on one player, but just as a Pink Floyd fan will hardly be able to cope with headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The service life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can do much more than just play music, but they can't even begin to do what mobile phones can do.
No modern device can be used as universally as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, making phone calls and texting, it can play music and videos, record both, it has sometimes a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you'll need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect cheap phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you then make phone calls from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a single charge.
Another problem exists if you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB lock, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can cope with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With players, you do not need any special software with exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, sorted by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is the main backdrop for you and you only hear it briefly every day, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is sufficient.
What almost every mobile phone can do.
You also don't have to control much what music formats a phone or player can handle.
MP3 can be done by everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and besides, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
All you have to do is go to the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet and you can buy a song or album.
This service in and of itself can be a compelling argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of selling music (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, reach for the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free kit with you.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only very few MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones for many will be the price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you can get a decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players lies in the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really be operated by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you reach for now?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But beware.
The base models typically only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding handsets, it is better to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest along here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will afford you MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, Czech operators offer practically all services as offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic ones to lower prices.
Perhaps this will not be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile phone providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
Incidentally, this was also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a declaration of war.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is a lot of competition on the Czech market.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has many chances (by the way, he would probably hardly find frequencies anymore).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile phone providers had to react.
Even before the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in Great Britain, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look far for examples.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers, becoming the fifth largest provider in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
You do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually distinguish themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to bet on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"Although we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking is more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to avoid creating a potential competitor.
Its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesperson.
Perhaps better times are coming.
According to unofficial information, the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has approached us," says Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2's press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point out the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build on."
And she adds: "By the end of the year, hardly any virtual providers will appear in T-Mobile's network.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think so quickly."
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is precisely what we consider best from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of the mobile phone providers is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something is also proven by the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came onto the market.
This is also proven by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is a suitable argument why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new entrant would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike Great Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, took its very typical attitude to this entire problem.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in response to our request.
From representatives of the providers, such a formulation would not be surprising.
This is more than worrying from an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses its position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
However, pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a reduction in prices are probably not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile phone providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same price of gasoline at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of fierce competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this case indicating anti-competitive action and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking for the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different perspective - the market entry of a virtual provider always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile phone provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment.
But even if you don't go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile phone providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The shifting of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to extend the competences of the ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, although a number of experts had hoped that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's possible when no one is looking
What remains unnoticed is the functioning of some pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but these are only partly public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price quotes (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which may lead to a termination of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not get around among those responsible for the mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
Indeed, they derive non-negligible profits from the activities of these companies, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used by only a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it like the normal customers of the mobile operators."
But that alone should at least seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question opens up for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such an approach, why do they oppose a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities and, if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers that they do not know about it and that their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has already pointed out several times, the entry of virtual providers has led to a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less in practice.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, not trying to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But let us not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and a virtual provider emerges soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally no longer make more expensive phone calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland in a ceremony on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was re-recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The arrangers of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices who are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
"From the very beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then also with the choir, so that the text is well understood, so that a harmony is created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theatre in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound
On Wednesday, the Prague public transport company will also transport on a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of Prague Public Transport as a date when the first passengers board a metro, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
Currently, about one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card can buy it.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it loaded onto their chip card at the same time at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, the coupons are also available on the Internet on the pages of the transport company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget about the output window in the metro stations, where they used to have to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is uploaded to the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travellers also have access to a counter with trained staff who advise interested parties when buying online and also put the coupon on the card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also upload the electronic coupons to the Opencard at self-service machines, which are mounted in some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket validators, passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný adds.
The coupon is checked by a vending machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
In other words, in suburban trains and on bus lines numbered 300 to 499, with which mainly residents from municipalities of the Central Bohemian region can reach the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, the train attendants have readers with which they can check the validity period of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague Public Transport Company.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's cash register.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the Opencard must also be placed in a marked place on the side of the cash register.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons that have been uploaded.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons displayed, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are loaded onto the card.
Here, the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the USA
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This emerges from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have approached the US president with such a wish.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Český Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the return to Czechoslovakia of the "Sudetengau" - which was captured by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads a letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of the Sudetes."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - to suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to assume the patronage of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the views of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you attribute this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has contributed absolutely nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Bohemian Forest Gau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that their deportation from the republic would be negotiated, only a few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from České Budějovice.
He served in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, Czech would suit them," says Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don't think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign aimed at motorists
Most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This could also characterize the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that this will dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to dissuade drivers from driving too fast and drinking and driving.
And also remind them to fasten their seat belts before starting their journey.
The campaign aims above all to appeal to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
If you don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see images with graphic shots of accident victims.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick for motorists
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and stick.
Carrot means that when they drive on red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, signs that alert drivers to a danger are already less effective.
"If you put up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The head of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out in favour of the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Yediot Achronot.
"We need to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Those who want safety in Jerusalem and, above all, do not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, alluding to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bern and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert affirmed.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do without to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shia) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shia) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaeda terrorist network and jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister stressed this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clarify, then surely, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted to work with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus seek release on bail and await his verdict in freedom, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be possible for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide "competent legal assistance" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he reiterated to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister evaded an answer to the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he merely stated.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance coach walking around is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus while driving.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week was likely caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus's path.
To make matters worse, the young woman was sitting next to the driver at that moment, in the least safe place in the car, although she still had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing room according to the vehicle registration document.
If this is not provided for on the bus, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency's long-distance coaches have no standing room; which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry and this initially did not agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was withdrawn and we reached a consensus that passengers should be allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they are seated," he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward – no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act recognises only the term vehicle attendant; However, it does not define its rights and obligations," the ministry spokesman Hanzelka clearly adds.
Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law covers this issue retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing room in the product approval.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there is standing room and the speed limit is limited, commuter buses with standing room and a higher speed allowed, and long-distance coaches without standing room with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like in an airplane, says the expert
BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see the movement of stewards on board a bus as a fundamental problem.
"With a smooth driving style, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump her head."
"However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says, adding that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering stewards' services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of steward is risky, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers when boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin justifies the lack of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, we have been resisting this from the very beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had said for Týden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, had an accident.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the hard shoulder without flashing and had blocked the bus's journey.
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats for the stewards were sold.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial damages from the guilty.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation, on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of the buses being the responsibility of the police and the health and safety authorities.
A Czech judges the struggle for the seabed
He approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small dot, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-strong team of the UN Division for Oceans and the Rights of the Sea.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
There is enthusiasm and enthusiasm here.
So far, the seabed contains a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Here you can find petroleum, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The riparian states today vehemently announced their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Put simply, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its bottoms that is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often also the limit of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the latter three countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas, recently met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed granted to it by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state proper.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The benefits they will derive from the use of the seabed in the future will, they hope, be invaluable.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which the Convention calls the "common heritage of mankind".
Here, no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold rush country," says director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that its "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, like the investors of a few other countries, granted the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor".
The organization has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatras on the seabed.
"You can mine there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, India's Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a model.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary Shem, which, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of big words in the letter from the WestLB board to the employees of the company.
By merging units of the Dusseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Savings Banks Finance Group" could be created, according to the letter that became known on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability to such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbank sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government that time is pressing to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk of some kind of connection between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and WestLB for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank boss Franz Waas let it be known at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he saw no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, half of which is supported by the Landesbanken and half by the savings bank associations, has instructed the Management Board to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, according to the financial centre, the talks have only just begun.
This is not the first time that Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers in the Financial Centre Frankfurt, has been mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came of this three-man alliance.
As soon as the plans became public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba's participation in them.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka-Bank with Landesbanken.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about a merger with his company.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to be maturing that the various houses of the public sector need to move closer together.
Now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, the first thing that could be a connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could come closer.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, it will gradually run out of partners.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far weathered the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to a merger with West LB.
At most, Nord LB would remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one aspect.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Savings Banks Association.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the local board of directors, it is said that in any case a "total solution" for the house will be sought.
It remains to be seen how this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank.
The second Wiesn weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded tiger and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses depart this evening at 11.45 pm, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arriving at 6.30 am.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one bus travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with imitation fur lining and glasses with wide silver temples, owns the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, with three tours this year alone.
There at night, during the day at the Oktoberfest, back at 10.30 pm.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed true to the Bavarian Purity Law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
It quickly becomes quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they will still need their strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the Autobahn 8 shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it is written on the left "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's time to run!" shouts Marco into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we will block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"Show the security guards that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they are gone!"
Thirdly: "Come back here at half past eleven tonight!" Understood?
And off you go to the Oktoberfest.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps as milestones to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian people's party.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no precise information on figures; there is talk of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and invade the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have travelled specially from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a national statistics in which the Italians occupy first place ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück just last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also flew in that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because that happened at the weekend.
The Dax-listed Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-euro loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part that it actually uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
This is due to losses at the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced itself at extremely short notice for long-term projects for which it had lent money - which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's cash reserve shrank by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while income from write-ups of receivables and certain securities as well as from the reversal of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the German Tax Code and from the management of Group companies, the decline in earnings was still moderate at around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which were then spun off into Aareal Bank.
Because it earned too little in traditional state financing, Depfa then became increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now make write-downs, which will have a "significant material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is said quite vaguely.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two-thirds for 2007.
Since the takeover of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a major provider of state and infrastructure finance.
It is more dependent than other institutions on funding in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has largely dried up again as banks hoard their liquidity.
Every year, Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing part of Depfa's loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is "shielded from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets".
According to other sources, the funds have secured refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to make use of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is even not unthinkable that the financing does not have to be used in full.
But even the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After late Sunday evening, according to reports, the bank was still on the verge of insolvency, even the at least temporary rescue cannot calm the minds.
The share price collapses by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up quite well.
While senior debt hardly moved, the prices of subordinated bonds are falling more significantly.
This mainly affects the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo real estate bonds previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their intrinsic value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had brought the crisis into its house with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less troubled commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be repaid on time.
Or it will happen what hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports that are coming thick and fast with the partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has currently only become a legitimate hope.
This is likely to give long-term creditors in particular some sleepless nights deciding whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can at least use a final stroke to form a loss carryforward for future withholding tax payments on price gains in later years.
German special forces were on site at hostage rescue
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When things got serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Defense and Interior Ministries, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, the air squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief were at the place of liberation.
As spokesmen for the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed, however, because the hostage-takers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany in order to integrate them as support forces on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the tour group of the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were abducted back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does this mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before the way to school I had trouble.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
The start of classes at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly fixed as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive from eight o'clock until a short round of meetings with the teacher begins, the 'home room', at twenty to nine.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and it's my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were all whispering, giggling and waving and I heard the word "kawaii" all the time.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It is part of the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, cute'.
Then I quickly rushed to my seat.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally stormed.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me holes in the stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - that's something different than the dull German sandwiches.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruit and a kind of meat in a tofu coat.
Most of the time I don't have a clue what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrr!
The bentos in Japanese schools are not just lunch.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which she then prepares particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy better during the snack break.
I've read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can observe this here.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I've loved reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So it was completely clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and traditions.
And they attach great importance to them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
US House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones rushed into the depths.
By 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout of the financial markets.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program, which was intended to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $ 700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on lawmakers to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors' concerns that the government rescue package could fail.
It recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to crash again after the failure became known.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
For the programme to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge" contributions of famous scientists have been published for several years.
In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this when we can't even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of sensation or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more highly developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So, at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals regardless of their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially using visualization as an example.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, focuses on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What is the result for the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So, what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this sense, sensations are closely tied to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and humans in particular.
Connected with linguistic nature, there are subtle gradations of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, thinks that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brainstem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-genus sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot disagree with this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels the same in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in case of danger whether it also feels fear?
In my opinion, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this for humans, how could you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level beckons, as long as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I do not study language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than constantly run into a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Vasyunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of European Championship stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at top speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish federation PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for Euro 2012 will not suffer as a result."
Several first division clubs had been sentenced to forced relegation last season alone for manipulation, after all, even the start of the league had to be postponed at short notice.
Tour operators record rising booking figures
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales of travel bookings for the coming months have risen significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the desire to travel among Germans remains unclouded, according to a study.
In the case of bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a turnover increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover increase of the travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, said the DRV.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the USA is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the increase in bookings amounts to around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic climes are particularly popular destinations for Germans.
Package tours in particular are very popular, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "easier to calculate for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that compared to the previous year again a sales increase will be recorded - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip fell compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private matters - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her former Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
It foams - and strikes back.
Belated War of the Roses for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant argument with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan had spoken in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week for the first time on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She only learned the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Outrageous," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg is once again regurgitating and rewriting the story of our relationship."
It is also "regrettable" that their 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that divorce means for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his remarks conclude with the side blow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after prices rose in the first quarter, found a significant slump in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate as the reason for this, which has led to a "declining desire to travel among American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares in the first quarter was also still upwards:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First Class the price changes were much smaller.
In Germany, prices collapsed even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices on German domestic flights have even halved.
The reason for the price slump is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV becomes the league leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still does not succeed in finding a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein Crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came late into the game and failed with a lifter to the crossbar.
His message was precisely formulated, it passed his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many a former player.
And so his request was heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order will have been similar: Bring gate two!
The implementation failed to materialise.
"Not everything was nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have liked it to be "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) have the Hamburg to thank the header of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as the top of the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify that," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim report stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-signed additions - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric and Jansen, who has been poached by FC Bayern - is slowly finding its way around, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," Jol said.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann après-ski hits in an endless loop, beer from liter mugs and celebrities in designer dirndls.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Barely three minutes at the Oktoberfest, the photographers pounce on us and take full of the memory cards - very flattering and that on my first visit to the Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually located north of the Weißwurst equator, the feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was still limited.
But once arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndls or lederhosen; No one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Only my dirndl apron earns strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to the fact that I have tied the apron incorrectly: "On the left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
Secretly, I friemel the loop from back to left.
"It fits," she said and laughed.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch out their naked buttocks uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionistic attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and is also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after getting rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the fairground, who have to take care of the poor suckers.
The nurses always appear in packs - always four at a time haul a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works as with most Oktoberfest visitors: empty out, full back again.
Who lies in the per mille coffin under the tarpaulin, you can not see.
"That's what goarnimmer packs," one of the paramedics called out to me on request and disappeared into the fray.
After the vote defeat
Fear is rife on Wall Street.
Initial news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily collapse by 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down a good five percent at 10,579 points.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at this time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could be gained.
The shares of the bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had invested in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid out in one fell swoop, but gradually.
In return, the state was to receive stock warrants from the financial companies, which could be redeemed if the share price developed accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Share prices in Europe and the USA in a downward pull
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the US do not resolve investors' doubts.
The share price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the Dax downwards.
The US index Dow Jones is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have dragged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the red.
Despite the rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, the share of the Munich-based real estate financier temporarily lost three-quarters of its value, while Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and was down 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world went to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to get financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese benchmark index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDax, Arcandor shares fell following the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed for the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity among researchers: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, she is now threatened with cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised the researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the time-honored law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened it Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously emanates an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six hostage-takers are said to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently reviewing their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are said to be already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was "only a matter of receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been disclosed.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later passed away.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The criminal court in Truro learned that he regularly handcuffed his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was being prosecuted by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said Ms Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended, "I used to tie her up and blindfold her."
"I didn't sexually assault her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended up in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I note the impact that her act has had on her daughter over the years, according to Stephanie's father and mother's description.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Official responsible for lost data is charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost highly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded from the Department of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action came as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "They would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be named, will be charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be prosecuted by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he released included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing associations face B&B costs
British housing associations could face costs of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley banks.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... It is now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the Association of Housing Associations, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved prudently during the housing boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs from those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were established in 1945.
"We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing associations and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Turkey broadens diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart
But once inside the arched ticket office, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, of which this was the westernmost entrance.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Company.
Germany, which was a latecomer in the imperialist game, intended to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by rail connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans faltered during World War I.
Its railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, an ammunition train blew up, destroying the ornate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely ignored by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, highlighting the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighboring regions created by the borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the fundamentals of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the lockstep of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city for the new secular state plan to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a custom-built, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to close the first deals of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbors.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could be forced to decide at some point," I asked.
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then emphasized a point that almost everyone I spoke to almost routinely recited: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can, figuratively speaking, travel east towards Asia and the Middle East on the same railway tracks.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this structure 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that much of Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited at the pier for the ferry that would take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there didn't seem to be much doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by a further five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after research by a consulting firm was conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale market price of Jersey Milch last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defence lawyers said the court refused bail on charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although she has been granted parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear under her release whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The high court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need bail as she is already on parole abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file an appeal on a point of law against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, an Awami Alliance party leader said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In Afghanistan's latest anti-polio initiative, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of vaccinating workers.
BSKYB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BSkyB has lost its appeal against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and allowed it to exert an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB's purchase of its stake in ITV cast doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BSkyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the US Attorney Affair
The U.S. attorney general has hired a special investigator to look into the dismissal of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officers interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
Appointing a special investigator with the authority to compel witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. attorneys from office in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be fired due to poor job performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of senior Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of Democratic voter fraud.
U.S. attorneys are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the dismissals and ultimately resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the inspector general's report critically addressed Gonzales' role, bearing "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, "abandoning" his leadership role and showing "extraordinary disinterest" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold award during the ceremony in London next week, said he was honoured to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards after being shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice provided by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was surgery in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, side streets, and other bypasses, some famous and others just convenient.
Still, even for seasoned taxi drivers and longtime locals, it's hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently constructed luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says she's fascinated by the short alley, simply because it's one of the remnants of the block's past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the local council's Land Use Committee this month, city council officials and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the contractor to purchase the road.
Still, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the county manager on City Council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to be owned by the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would repave the small street and set up seats that are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Facility Protection, said it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street, stressing that the department's job was to develop rather than manage the properties.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic touch.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have hailed Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), has published part of the city's history conversation about Extra Place, which appeared in "The New Yorker" magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, locked windows and week-old newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested the street could be brushed up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the allure of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Bilingual Education Debate: Education in English-speaking Environments
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in California Studies and senior director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not As Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Selection."
Appealing to Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a case in point.
Obama's campaign mentions that "African-American and Hispanic students are less likely to successfully complete school than white students" – which is true.
To close this achievement gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition period in education for those who are just learning English.
Still, Obama's question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching languages other than English, runs counter to his interest in narrowing the gap in school performance.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth grade were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success was achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, constant monitoring of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach according to which the education takes place in an English-speaking environment. That's exactly the point Obama should keep in mind, according to Principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in subject teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama use a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with large numbers of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about "English only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child knows Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despising and trivializing them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears for the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even the US bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been rocked by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 a barrel this month, only to rise again as a result of enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again concerned, although congressional officials had announced that they had agreed over the weekend on a bailout plan that would be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is to buy the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, according to a government announcement on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to fall further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a note to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From a goods market perspective, what we're most concerned about is whether the U.S. virus is spreading globally, particularly to China."
The bank's analysts have revised downwards their oil consumption expectations for the coming year due to weak economic growth, and lowered their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Central defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all after wearing a Jets jersey more than anyone over the past eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre's pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon in which their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one slipping as a full-back and the other time 10 seconds before the end of halftime.
"I didn't try very hard," Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Full-back Darrelle Revis intercepted an unfortunate shot and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith got another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest one.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot for a 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets coach, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response to the response of both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to complete the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world title or set a world record on every distance from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon for fears, perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he has registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distances, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Obviously, he came back refreshed after a break and not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized – particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars in general, relying too much on race leaders as if it were a track race, and putting world records above competition.
But this criticism hardly harms Gebrselassie's greatness as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the course in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers slowed down.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last run to part ways with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her personal best by five minutes in her third marathon.
She cleverly planned her run by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run away, but overtaking them after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Tucked away among the excesses of Orlando's theme parks, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first all-black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is not as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee joined the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project during the Depression – is in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many here continue to tire of being watched by outsiders.
"We're very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a city resident by birth and a parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is on the one hand a stronghold of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and on guard.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in heartfelt books written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide transformed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida, into the scenes of black history and human drama.
Cheeky as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-and-white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits lesson rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual innuendo.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came roaring into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a rear terrace overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no grand memorial service, no public readings on a grand scale.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy in the slightest," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turning point came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 50s, the fight against miscegenation brought hatred into the community.
"During that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting aside," Mr. Franklin said.
"There was even a woman who was killed once.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration, calling its decision in the Brown case against the school board "offensive rather than respectful of my race."
Residents now say that while desegregation was positive in some ways, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember — you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean, there's a cultural divide," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil liberties have helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who defied prejudice as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, "How can anyone deny himself the joy of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookshelves, making it once again part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway enlivened the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
More and more newcomers came, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past anew.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
These days, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville's history and significance are often still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission and certain things — such as the mural of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man depicting black men working in the fields — may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of homeland pride was born.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city council or the police that he says could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said the other day after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, financial Latin is fluent.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and massive TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst day of horror work every day since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud clatters and carry trays loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still shuffle between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with some 50 ironed T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bags at food stalls on the sidewalks, and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a weekday.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the doomsday talk.
Although I had decided to schedule my duty to the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase main branch, there were already about 20 people queuing up.
Not at the cash counters to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for directions to Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my "licensed personal bank clerk," were queuing for the same reason I did.
unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a building society), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks quietly went bust.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into receivership, and when New Yorkers drove home for the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion worth of savings, was looking for a bailout buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and store workers who lined up before me took their cash to a safe haven bank, a bank responsible for most of Wall Street's bailouts.
Ordinary New Yorkers have acquired fluent financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has strayed from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music that was presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting and lasted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which never diminished for years.
How many times did death encourage us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say: "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never bossy but never exuberant.
However high the musical level, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years or so I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - often I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He loathed conductors who, in his words, simply "peddled one or two well-known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship in 1950... while studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD degree at the same time.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950-1951 on a Houblon Norman Fellowship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated during rightward slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization."
They carry signs in the style of road signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating graves at a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties are making significant gains in the country's general election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized according to police.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but detectives believe this is an attempt to disguise the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave desecration, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan drew to a close.
At the same time, Austria is facing a round of conscience after the country slid to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even expressed his aversion to foods generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which say that the far right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned by court from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted a travel ban last Thursday after presenting judges with evidence of Glitter's criminal record of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Court reported: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent Police applied to Ashford Magistrate Court for permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
As required by the Sex Offender Register, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police force said: "Kent police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system in place to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the top priority of Kent police to protect Kent residents and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk that may exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some back and forth.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
According to the Home Office, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master backstage to capture his character,' says Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no frills, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find gestures typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts varied theatricality of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a particular iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is increasing day by day," explains the artist, making it clear that 'flamenco people' "can be any human being, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Ordinary people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera'.
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that are reminiscent of classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image modernity and the idea of how the peasant understands flamenco: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Well-known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the shortlist of the nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer admits that 'I really like photographing people, getting to know them and putting myself in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer period of time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or bump into people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of flamenco of today, entitled 'Flamenco-people', is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is 'foolhardy'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazons.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favourite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is engaged in is 'foolhardiness' and 'everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
'If I had been level-headed, I wouldn't have done it, but I will and hope to finish the novel at some point,' so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won Premium at the Hay Festival and voted for most of the attendees, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and realized that he had an audience in front of him who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature came about, born out of 'extraordinary adventurousness', from 'the joy of reading' and from 'wanting to experience more',  than before'; how he writes and 'maintains discipline' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'memory images' form the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that there is "no way" to measure and how to know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience," Vargas Llosa insisted, who claims it 'creates effects' and 'makes people even more apart'.  that is why I asked writers to 'abandon themselves to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play along: bullfighting festivals were partly cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters realized that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded, was postponed to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to the unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had achieved more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, which passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, much of the crowd responded with boos during his second fight.
In Álava, two people wanted to avoid control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, whereupon they fled.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., according to the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officers of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to evade control.
The police started the pursuit until the car stopped after a few kilometers at the hard shoulder. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee over a country road into a wooded area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with bundles of hashish, which were later sent to other police stations for detailed laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles.
In addition, the officers found that the license plate was 'double', so that it did not match the number plate indicated in the vehicle documents, which is why an additional arrest for forgery of official documents took place.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation in order to arrest the second suspect who, as already mentioned, managed to escape, but also to establish the origin of the drugs seized.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be brought before the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the action of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for playing Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the action of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried in a rather strange way out of her parking space in Montecito, reported spokesman for the traffic police of California the magazine 'People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear 'pressed the accelerator pedal after 4:30pm and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she reversed, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times'.
A little later, the witness, who had probably not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency services because she was 'afraid for Locklear's life'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the road and blocking traffic.
"She seemed disoriented," so the police took her to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. "According to the initial observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention center around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and deputy of the United Left, has assured today that the regional association for education will be the one that will make the decision in the case of the former Councillor for Youth and Sport of the City Hall of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that will have to take responsibility for this," Llamazares pointed out, pointing out what approach the party must have towards who, until now, sits as a councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva may have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases be given maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has "a strict ethical code for all public offices".
'Sangre de mayo': Book of heroes by Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci depicts in 'Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in the filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the shooting.
In this way, the cineaste has tried to 'portray a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
'Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of Galdós' literature, assures us that thanks to this filming, his 'childhood dream' came true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Community of Madrid to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary celebration on 2 November in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million provided by the Community of Madrid for filming offers Garci, he added, the 'unique opportunity' to portray the image of 'confused Spain that chose the wrong leader for the struggle because the people had been put behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the cineaste regrets that one could not count on the financing as in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', participated through his usual way of working: he stood on stage with the actors with whom you have to rehearse before you start shooting and for those who had not done a casting, he seemed 'humiliating' and respectful, 'part of the profession of film director is to  To help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many of the actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize it's just for thriving, and now you're satisfied when you've produced another film,' explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and campaigned for the abolition of the corset that restricted free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We try not to talk about her life, but to preserve her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance basics helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, 'The Dance of the Butterfly' seemed to me like guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing was also in this aesthetic realm," she claims.
The production anticipates two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work and I am very honored.'
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes on the role of accompanist of the artists who were divas, with whom he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no one appreciates today and therefore even less," Bayón claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennian
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', inaugurated in May and after being in different places in Andalusia,  New York has now reached New York and will be presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The US can hardly imagine without Paul Newman
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensationsreporter', and from the then prevailing idea of American cinema, which was abandoned and came from all over America to Newman with his inspiring performance and followed it.
Now look what it cost them to award him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford, weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.'
No one was afraid of ridiculing or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment when there is fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, when the depressed self-esteem of Americans is hopelessly searching for reasons to regain dignity.
If there are only a few people to admire in these hard times without virtue, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, suffered both profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and created in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country, where it took him a lot of effort to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement hits high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was nothing more or nothing less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have been left by the greatest of us all," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on Earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was he as proud of as that of faithful husband, loving father, attentive grandpa and philanthropist," they say.
For the Olympic Games, the roads in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, maybe it can be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we ready for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with all the trimmings there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, something like this would clearly not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with getting tickets, which allows you to leave first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you do it, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
Well, not at all.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense is to go there just because of it) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size 'S' (a second nonsense, because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if we had succeeded once, but getting them back would be more difficult.
In addition, it looked like rain in these 40 minutes of waiting, so there was the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow surely some 500 people will have pneumonia and some like me will not even show up in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the outcome was mislabeled.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, this street would never occur to me.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time to come.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a route planner to move around the company's campus). The system pays attention to what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, she can listen and understand the keywords of her conversation.
It can also classify those present into the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person does not belong to the group that is talking to her, and that he is not a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better stuff to focus on, such as the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week, there was very superficial talk about Microsoft's change in strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and won't have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the bare necessities instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
It's all just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many cleverly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the vicinity of the 'windows'.
What is half of the computer's existing applications for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt. Let me give you a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
There is a sign on the soft drinks machine: 'Your search. Our Future'. It prints a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google to do research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 is lagging behind.
It will not be released at the beginning but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore this mark in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is part of the clothing of a well-built pastor.
If we begin to enumerate the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavyweights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
Firstly, because of his great name, although she is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend has it that the origin of the name is linked to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' towers over everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only focus on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, striped t-shirts, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a pity to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this MPV offered a much larger one.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes before the impending revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new Jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before starting to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new Jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars. This is 17% of the assumed growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002. That's 6.7% of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the store in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the reduction in sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to end the year with total sales of 22,000 models. This is 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year all over the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, with the remainder distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous Jazz model.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 liters, that is, 19 liters larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-liter gasoline engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-liter gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, whereas the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
Jazz's second-generation engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque power for the entire engine lifetime.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 revolutions with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, he now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the Gruz siblings take their new job in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there and also makes the presentation of the most important rewards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and attending the dinner in Valentino's honour.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I, are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything comes together and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I was fascinated by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real actor role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
You recently turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh yes.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman matures, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother, or not?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and raise him with much love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and that were shot last year.
That's exactly how it is and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago you appeared on the running path with Naomi Campbell, is that true?
That's good, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the Laufstieg to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organisation's Women for a Better World charity event and the clothes we are showing. I know that two garments from our collection were auctioned for Mango to raise the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are said about them. I, as the one who knows them, would tell you that they are not true.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
'Car bee' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Technical Development Center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing are the compound eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
In order to simulate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into signal for avoiding the collision.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the little robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90º or even greater angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, but also not overheaded; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways as bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
'This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on that information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for immediate collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in production cars over the next decade.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide you to the destination while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
Motorists who may relapse due to alcohol levels will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car while drunk. If he is drunk, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Attorney General's report. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last one year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Prosecutor General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol got back behind the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has taken a breathalyzer test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000 and is borne by the person imposing the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be realized in the usual way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is demanded, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available in any store on the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, of all days, the Chamber of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time scheduled by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled, landed.
The sun was setting, but its rays still forced the hand to be used as a parasol to see the royal couple stepping off the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time She is from here or so
No, she is Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
-Oh, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Navy soldiers, who make a salvo of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary peep-toes, perhaps she has been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to make jokes.
She is shaking before she is mortgaged.
It must be understood that the US Treasury, apart from having sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid that the US citizens get involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', they say.
Or perhaps, the 'hotel of bad credit' or mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specifically its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it is the moment not to ask for a loan.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game expands?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
The best premium in fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to showcase a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international enhancement of young fashion talents.
This will be awarded a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the window of the Mango store at Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m².
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that involve thanking fashion designer Valentino for chairing the jury of the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by pain because his brother recently died, pulls herself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH that was stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up together with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the shop and wore trousers and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were happy about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There are not 1000, but one more possibility to forget chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book in which it says how to relax. The book hits bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment if it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to disconnect from the world of work.
But the number increases, no more and no less than until 1001.
In addition to yoga postures, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the tastes and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 ways to relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts is refuted by this handbook refutes such beliefs.
In addition, the methods offered are how to stay in touch with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are proposed.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off your brain and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking during sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ), the next day the child can not remember anything.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often connections are sought with other phenomena during sleep, such as nightmares, panicked anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or excessive demands.
In any case, this is a little-researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is highly variable.
It can be that you speak calmly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite the opposite (screams, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and arises in this way.
We've said it's a positive disorder, so it's not treated, be it linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep peacefully.
If talking occurs during sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rouse him from sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if he shows himself frightened after a few apparitions, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what the child's reason for the fear is.
If they understand what they are saying (which is not so common), do not pressure the child to conduct an interrogation and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhäusern ... At last
After a long lean period, Illhäusern is finally back on the road to success on the pitch.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks created numerous scoring chances and managed to convert one of them to win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot just missed the angle, Illhäusern should dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Hirn with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of his foot, to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, letting only the lively Riahi at the head of the storm through.
The start of the second half was to be decisive, with two scoring chances created by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was just right to take back a ball that had been blocked by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the Illhäusische scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, whereby his teammates had to continue to play outnumbered.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not pose any major problems to an illhaeusian eleven, who only retreated a little to 'condense' their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball went very close to the crossbar after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
Faced with the firm stance of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hoped that he would come up with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit comes at the same time as a General Assembly of the crisis committee set up by Breton fishermen to impose measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, "the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to safeguard the working conditions and pay of seafarers".
Sarkozy is expected with determination by fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not broken.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from early morning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique broke up the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue," because "the fishermen will not give in on any point" and "do not want to go to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer meets 2008 delivery guidance
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially for its 30 to 120-seat aircraft.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Administration, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was given.
AIG is poised to pursue the sale of much of its business, beyond its international life insurance and retirement savings in the United States.
According to the FT, AIG's board of directors met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Among the assets AIG could divest is its aircraft leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments, the FT said.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as quickly as possible in order to repay the $85 billion in loans granted to it by the federal reserve, even at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of its capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the decline in trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final kill figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the House of Representatives' unexpected rejection of the plan to bail out the banks, which was supposed to restore some stability to the markets, Wall Street, which had already been battered at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MPs denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad image that portrays Congress as incapable of adopting a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come 'too late'.
"If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be up to the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, stressing even more the sense of extreme urgency, "that every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial enterprise" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy Wachovia's banking business by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing 'not just an American crisis, but a global crisis', the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
Treasury revenues in ten years fell from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenues in 30 years fell from 4.161% to 4.357% last night.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks said MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a uniform price of $25.25, for a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the market value of the share on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will give it a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global deal will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, 28% above the current market value.
However, Morgan Stanley shares fell 6.79% to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding bank status," said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted that status last week, which should allow it to expand its operations into new areas, but under the supervision of the federal reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the settlement has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan simply said it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," explained Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo, "we thought the stake would consist entirely of common stock.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will go ahead with a reduction in earnings of about 20% per share.
The settlement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and grow its sales.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should have a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had "significantly" reduced its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its share price fall by half while the price of insolvent insurance soared.
That price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establish the republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third party who, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, put the plan for a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results amounting to 80% of the vote, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of ballots were invalid and 0.7% were blank.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, one vote more than half of all votes cast must be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for 'yes', predicting 63% to 70% for him.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held quietly according to the Observation Delegation of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'plan development' in a country that lives largely on oil production by foreign companies and on the foreign currency sent into the country by emigrants.
The project, promoted by Correa, elected in 2006, also gives greater powers to the head of state, who will be able to hold up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the option of dissolving the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also safeguards the principle of free medical care and education, which the president has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also proposes to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorian base as a staging point for American counter-narcotics operations.
Obama, winner on points in the first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two White House nominees was followed by another to see who won it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, the QGs announced their own victory in this televised duel, which was to be watched by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while quite respectable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to halt his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday showing Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly cuts a better figure.
Among undecided voters, those who matter now, Obama emerged victorious with 39%, while 25% of them see McCain as the winner, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to emphasize his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, clearly underlining his opponent's "naivety" on these issues, which were at the heart of this first televised debate.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...," he insisted several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
A point of attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election commercials.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without letting himself be upset.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and renew the world's image of the United States.
"McCain still hasn't understood, but Obama has," said a Democratic campaign ad this weekend, accusing Republicans of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis weighing on the "American off the streets."
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in pouring rain for an election rally in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'worker'. ' The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider best suited to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
After reiterating that he would probably even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were top priorities for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully dodged the questions related to the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and members of the opposition demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of polling stations in Minsk's market square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't vote in the first place: 'What's the point if they do what they want with my vote anyway,' says a teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including the denial of visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and the freezing up of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous coalition of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive.
When opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean airtime on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition therefore owes it to itself to interfere in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent'.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election, will not recognize the election as valid.
It stresses that the turnout figures seem too high and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
"Did you notice that an election has taken place?" asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who most closely meet the government's expectations. '
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon safe and sound.
In the morning they had been liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at al-Maza military base next to Cairo International Airport at around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined.
They are all in "good health" and the kidnappers "were not ransomed," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
After being captured on September 19 during an all-terrain vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats, Franco Frattini, reported from Belgrade, where he is at the moment, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence and special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped an all-terrain vehicle carrying the hijackers during a patrol, killing six, including the Chad-born leader, and arresting two.
The army stated that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate about the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
So much the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that are starving miserably?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is allocating 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the case of our American neighbors, their country's constitution states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of parliament and all administrative districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, are working to study history intensively, save the numerous private archives with a few pennies, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the force of desperation as promoters and decision-makers unleash their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and heritage?
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public trust, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service were contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public discontent, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of shedding light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and developing guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to give his report, several provinces set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for administering blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood storage system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood and through the work in this area during the following years, we have regained the trust of the public," she says, before proudly emphasizing that in early 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on a prudent basis.
At that time, we witnessed the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself through degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event showed us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, rather than that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation period that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and that this could not be detected.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving blood infected with HIV.
"In other words, you would have to distribute 12 million blood units before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood units each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted via a blood reservoir occurs.
I believe that nowadays you can feel comfortable getting or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
"Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects via the blood.
We need to monitor continuously," Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate supplies in addition to secure supplies.
"Demand is increasing because the population is aging.
Because treatments to fight cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebec's eligible for blood donation. '
Any healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is prevalent are excluded from donating blood for one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they grow older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it's rare to find the time to spend an hour donating blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin used almost exclusively for severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, which used to be considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand annually.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division elimination matches yesterday thanks to a 3-to-1 win (4-3 with all goals) against Seattle's Sounders in the second and deciding match of the quarterfinal series at Saputo Stadium, where overall goal difference counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for Montreal's formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in Matt Jordan's way for the Sounders.
Recall that in Friday's first game of the preliminary and second leg series, Impact had earned the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle a 2-1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to make up for a 3-to-1 deficit with a 4-to-3 win in the second leg in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with an overall goal difference of 5-4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - winning goal by Kovalev
The Canadian team's No. 1 trio is ready to tackle the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec provided two assists and Kovalev converted a pass in this winning game, the fourth in the Tricolore in six pre-season games.
Kovalev scored the victory by scoring the only goal of the whole shootout.
'I'm not ready yet,' warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable. '
'He was too fixated on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received thunderous applause. '
Charest focuses on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
'Shifting the course of our last great border in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines entirely.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens were spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, Quebec viewed in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources, as during the parliamentary term.
Speaking to the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the possibility of holding elections this autumn, even though he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'vision' the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' involving an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister confined himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not give a date, investment amounts or precise priorities for the projects to come.
At most, a few glimpses of what could be worked on more: mainly in hydropower, in forests, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charest's list, the North has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'territory twice the size of France' is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is in us,' he stressed, as if to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national entrepreneurial dream.
Quebec has grown a lot through its connection with the North, he pointed out: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the Bay of James.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after pausing theatrically to look at the giant map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
"This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a borderline where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable year-round due to melting ice.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the indigenous people and the Inuit?
The Premier said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP for Ungava), have already initiated consultations with some thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) occupies an important place, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large gathering, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan Nord will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of that of the liberal prime ministers who had been in office before him.
"Like the Liberals who came before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This, by the way, was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage taking over the leadership of the party.
One of the adopted decisions provides for the Beauharnois power station to be renamed the Adélard Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of hydroelectric electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future," Jean Charest explained.
He referred to another, this time conservative, project to the press, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr. Charest emphasizes that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
'That remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which provoked storms of applause during those parties.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which he is legally able to do.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission to China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend's General Assembly provided the Liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, above all 'constitutional objectives' that were readily adopted: the PLQ specifically calls for recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and for them to have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of Plan Nord were received with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has revived the Nord-du-Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, 'we would have been much further along today', said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken out in favour of supporting the government's adoption of a Plan North.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big performance," declared party leader Sébastien Proulx on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Land
It was Mr Vic Toews, ex-'justice' minister (ironically) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer took the liberty of saying of Louise Arbour that she was a 'disgrace' to Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending battle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, among all the countries concerned, has not brought home its compatriot who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things he is accused of happening happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who condescends to a parody of justice in order to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult will surely be mentally broken forever after so many years of torment.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality at all: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government who is still supported only by the minority (may he belong to the minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this detachment, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy General Manager of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
He confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a six-million libel suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they are not judging the truth, especially not in the case of libel suits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to bankrupt anyone who dares to hold one of their opposing opinions.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Moreover, the tactic in these unequal battles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement that silences the other side and also deters anyone who dares to revisit the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would have had to present its point of view to public opinion.
In contrast to what is common practice in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are usually fought through the exchange of ideas rather than by stick-blows.
It would therefore have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion, brushing aside petitions and letters in support of Noir Canada's authors with a wave of his hand.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and at the same time disregard the opinions of that very public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice President, this word encompasses only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand—or doesn't want to understand—is that the public, who support Noir Canada's writers and editors, do so primarily because they reject the gold mine's brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, demanding that they stop using this term...).
Aside from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic inquiry and truth-making that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it's impossible in a country like Canada to research and discuss issues that the world's rich corporations don't like, who else can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could have it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment, to which we belong, has long known how to get a grip on debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for public debate, and it's time for governments to take action that curtails these types of unwarranted lawsuits.
Bailout for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the '30s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control by MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public funds invested, new orders to curb the number of houses seized due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will have a market impact," said Bush administration official Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis," the Democrat said.
"This is the fundamental point: If we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and unrest in Americans' daily lives will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours, fearing the impact that another failure would have had on investor sentiment.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were late in the negotiations, were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain executive orders to the settlement, most notably those that would allow owners to keep their homes and those that affect the salaries of executives of companies bailed out by the state.
"Asking taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people is nothing to congratulate ourselves on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
"The guiding principles I've read [show] that this is one thing we're all going to have to digest, and we're going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to use taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage lending (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more common bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freezing of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed last week's first attempt at agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, one believes that the impasse has escaped.
To round out the perspective for everyone in Congress, an executive order has also been added stating that if the government were to make losses on this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to recover the capital it had invested.
The new plan calls for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for its help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that pay it dividends in case of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm passes.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to halt the attachment proceedings concerning the apartments tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments to be paid to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more voices were raised yesterday against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't understand us," Republican Scott Garett, a member of the chamber's finance committee, told his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of making taxpayers pay'.
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called "the skeptics," presents things differently but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider which path to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again proving that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which has been in deep trouble since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we are given the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value now that uncertain times are looming. '
During this period, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalising another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government has had to nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was his trump card for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor with the charming smile freed himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly horrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema during the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian descent.
His European roots were to become one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, utmost quality feature.
Because it reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, with the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 50s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he had been in a model relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also disappear the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and oversensitive to the glamour of show business star, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sent cinema lovers into a frenzy this weekend, while all his great roles were played out on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in constant change passes by with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes back to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It evokes a much more recent memory (1990), that of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death and which made Newman famous in 1956.
This likeable crook in the outstanding The Sting, who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
His curriculum vitae unites epochs.
Young people know him best from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the less orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as Godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played sunny boys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, villains or desperate, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slide and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of tributes pouring over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared with great emotion: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, is now also leaving.
We have probably often seen him with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged until the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honour to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the trial of János Zuschlag and his accomplices begins.
The defendants are accused in particular of participation in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including falsification of documents.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the local government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when receiving the tender funds, and the clubs are said not to have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were forged.
The invoice blocks were bought at the Józsefváros market, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices to was decided on the round trip north of Lake Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by Jáno's surcharge.
In the course of this "exploratory tour", Lados was to locate guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded invoices for the consumptions in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the local government of Budapest based on these templates.
The majority of these invoices are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for drafting the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering business is said to have entertained the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the boss of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant all at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious errors in form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
There were apparently no limits to the imagination of the invoice forgers when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering business in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As managing director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that these were forged documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor's office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the establishment is said to have accommodated one hundred people was also wrong, since they have a total of eleven rooms, which cannot possibly accommodate so many people.
Catering was also listed on the invoice, although the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The diligent invoice forgers also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offers trips abroad, and so they indicated trips to Hungary on the cash invoice, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As it became known in the course of the investigation, they also stated VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT on a total of four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation was incorrect, as the company charges only 15% VAT instead of 25, and only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "accountants" was that in one case they had declared "transport of goods" as the service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office said.
Thanks to further formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
The same applies to Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" was made by the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group is said to have eaten there - the trustee in bankruptcy therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Deliberately forged
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to submit fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation in the amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation and the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with forged invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million relating to services not provided.
However, there were also no payment transactions, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the persons concerned forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest but cannot be found there.
In the period from October to December 2005, that company is alleged to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of HUF of approximately 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, acted as the purchaser of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be served by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to having issued invoices in the name of the LLC to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent value himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers at Iván Kubatov's express request.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company formation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices with a total value of HUF 14.2 million to the organizations on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The public prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for other purposes.
In order to cover this up, they presented the TMA with five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft.
Incidentally, these invoices were seized during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
During the trials, some defendants are now expected to confess to the procedure of falsifying invoices, as they have already been filed before the public prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him to make good the bulk of the damage of HUF 50 million, and whether Zuschlag is prepared to accept responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that Zuschlag is now playing the "offended" after his requests for mitigation of detention and house arrest fell on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have caused far greater damage with economic crimes and have not compensated them, are at large, or at least under house arrest, Zuschlag is denied this possibility.
The psychology of outbidding – or why we're willing to pay more
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue what is offered for sale.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people do not want to admit defeat in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play the lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which outbidding the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group have also carried out studies on the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged victorious from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in case of a lost game.
The only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on winning while the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to bet higher than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have justified the behaviors observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to neurological imaging, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, however, the pathogens and the diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and eyes, the stool becomes light, urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die every year from hepatitis B-triggered, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is undergoing drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this condition is more common: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
If detected in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby averting the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by patient advocacy groups worldwide.
The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its development and the importance of early detection.
Benelux governments nationalise parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level discussions over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the European Commission's competition authority.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis, which has been going on for a year, so decisions now being taken in connection with the bank could set a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states are buying about 49 percent of the bank's respective shares.
The bank is expected to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities bought by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares began a steep slide last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The institution's securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the $700 billion US bailout and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party with a factual offer was found.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
So far, no panic has broken out among customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show, religious faith acts like a kind of "painkiller" that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined to what extent belief in God influences people's perception of pain, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and 12 atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it could even be proven that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
In the experiment, a sparkling device was tied to the left hand of the subjects, which delivered the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with an Ermine".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful while choosing da Vinci's image because it was little different from the other painting and was perceived as soothing.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while looking at either the religious painting or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for", and they felt "peace and quiet".
While looking at the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be created with other, strong-looking images in the atheists, one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing the faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question that remains is what effect a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can justifiably claim: she can be found in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: She knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that's not all, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he says: These would overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, moving closer to the company's original goal of "organizing all the information in the world."
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of collecting information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said that he wished Google was able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet research, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which the search was made and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search", introduced two years ago, allows the visitor to save his own search history and access it later, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also the basis for the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data misuse - "If you look up what I do" - some are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is frightening, rather than guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or rebellion against power that is rejected by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties if necessary, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent crackdown on pedophilia in Brazil, where Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called Orkut, which also allowed the pedophilia to be identified.
However, users concerned about personal rights could still breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully took the FBI to court: according to this, Google cannot be forced to hand over information to the FBI on secret request with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search term list, was withheld retroactively for two months.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: Those who are reluctant to give over their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy by using Google services castigate the company with the indignation due to the conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees in them the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs", in contrast to Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to provide identification codes and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the fore, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
"Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teen can manage their profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries listed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of the previous night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful boyfriend has had fun, or the employee is dismissed because he is all too honest in his blog his anger about the company management - one thing is certain: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals about himself - this is how you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even to circumvent the Google monopoly, is welcome to do so - as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace.
Quite a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, meanwhile, is waiting spellbound for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the ever faster introduction of services is a headache not only for Microsoft but also for other software developers.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing opposite poles: For example, the company management completely rejected a protest by employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the repeated catering of the employees was too expensive. However, all this seems downright mild compared to the fact that Google even bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement according to which all dissident hits, or those that violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn things upside down: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking on proportions that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi authors with the material - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd to eliminate traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two teenagers who are suspected of having helped to remove the traces, said the spokesman for the police commissariat Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people confessed, currently they are accused of aiding and abetting.
According to information from the MTI news agency, they are two girls who are defending themselves at large.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect in Ózd's double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The man is strongly suspected of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a compound in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act long ago - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange launches purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the one hundred percent purchase of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to reports in the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the worsening international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke of the "second 11 September".
We owe the global financial catastrophe to the American president, said La Repubblica - the president was not even able to unite his own party behind him for the bill, which was supposed to bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11."
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, writes the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states could still provide rescue packages to their faltering financial institutions and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and even more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, recalls the Viennese "Der Standard". In addition, the newspaper continues, concerns are becoming increasingly realistic that, after the Americans, European taxpayers will now have to dig a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" would not have to "wag" hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not imitating the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, that of bees.
An amazing project was unveiled at CEATEC in Japan, where Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees to create new accident-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "protective shield," said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-guided distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it weren't so, the car robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer within which accidents are currently still considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, unlike the bees, the evasion cannot be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the manoeuvrability of the tires.
While the bees have an infinite number of possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational movement, acceleration and deceleration of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn't have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so it only takes up a handful of KB of memory on an ongoing basis.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte memories.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in series production within the next decade.
Another application of the technology could be GPS satellite navigation by deliberately steering the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to his destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the bad loans of the banks.
In the first round, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, the congressmen have struggled after several days of debates to reach an agreement on the $ 700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, and said that the agreement only had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the tide of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but has not triggered a soaring flight on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 economic stabilization bill, then it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on buying bad securities burdened with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the case on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, bad securities, and the president is to decide on the other USD 100 billion.
The program is reviewed by a separate commission, which includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
Under the law, the Treasury can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgaged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction, as well as directly.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a major financial institution.
"We are taking the necessary steps to get the law ready to be introduced as soon as it is signed," Paulson said.
However, the heads of the troubled banks, which are now dependent on state aid, can expect their settlements, which are casually called the "Golden Handshake" in overseas slang, to be cut by the government.
A cut in salaries will only occur in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps out in each case.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry buys at auction, the "golden handshake" will be taxed unless the retired bank boss is deported to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that manager salaries are not excessive.
It is also part of the picture that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank is better again.
The bill stipulates that the president must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there have been skeptics on both sides who have expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were driven by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
According to the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.

Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Manufacturing selling prices have also risen only slightly -- 0.1 percent -- since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove up prices for chemicals and production significantly (1.6 percent).
A price decline was recorded for crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and slightly for wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, as well as in publishing and printing, remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic sales markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the price increase for gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the processing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing rose the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price decline was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the fixed goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the manufacturing sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 percent).
A price increase of 6.8 percent was recorded in the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, while a price reduction of 1.4 percent was recorded for fixed goods.
Industrial export prices, measured in forints, rose 1.1 percent month-on-month in August, but fell 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, 7.1 percent against the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 exchange rate, it became 7.5 percent stronger against the euro and the dollar by as much as 15.9 percent.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained to representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom she will present the Republic of Hungary's "Medium Cross of Merit with Star," and she will also hold talks with Democrat Barack Obama's foreign policy advisers and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bank bailout package on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials announced on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout package after days of marathon deliberations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their respective adversaries to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama has been able to extend his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly approve the $700 billion package.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and act responsibly (...) - Your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he told 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain declared, "We're all going to have a hard time with that (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative".
The Republican senator said the plan also calls for the establishment of a control commission for the Treasury secretary, as well as restrictions on severance pay for top executives — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the secretary.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking countries
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp have become more self-confident - this is how "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern in order to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bavaria's revolution eats its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria over decades - now modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epochal break is at the same time a problem for Christian Democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a complete surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, had already become apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Because ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization consistently pursued by the CSU in the federal state has finally wiped out its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but miscalculated the pace considerably. But secularization, educational successes and the influx of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without effects on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with the increase in options. And this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and headstrong.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classic citizen groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with Abitur and university degree.
Here, the support of the CSU fell to even below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily reports in its "Wer mit whom? Party leaders cautious on coalition issues" titled article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly showed their cards.
SPÖ leader Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP leader as vice chancellor.
As he said, the voters had voted out the Schüssel-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
Molterer, however, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-black, we are prepared to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which this year is being hosted by France, the country holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU, began today in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the rights suffered by Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to their need for recognition.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of Fidesz MEPs, Járóka has drawn attention to the fact that, in addition to discrimination in the search for a job, the Roma are being pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can obtain a tertiary education."
Járóka also emphasized that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economies of EU member states.
MEPs believe that it is important that the widest possible circle - i.e. Roma and non-Roma - becomes aware of these connections.
The earlier a Roma pupil starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income tax and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As EU citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped," said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is needed to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector. To this end, correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka said.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of medication data to the consent of the person concerned in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we will entrust the chickens to the fox," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, developer of the prescription data tracking program.
Insurance companies determine the fees and the payout amounts in the event of damage depending on the customer's state of health, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance is not taken out at all.
Previously, the client was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer's identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e. which preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood lipid level is untreatably high, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraines and hot flashes, but also depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the insurers' point of view, while the aforementioned ones are not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, separate companies have been formed, which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug consumption. In this way, they provide an even more accurate picture of the patient's state of health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time it is becoming more difficult to control its use.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the agencies could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program further so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
CSU: Temporary grace
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in office, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party congress.
However, the much-criticized duo has already indicated that they do not want to stick to their chairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole ruler" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the party's internal restructuring, Huber's potential successor, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, will also be involved in the exploratory team that is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list "Free Voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, and then mercilessly dismissed the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few venomous remarks in the direction of the CDU - in his view, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to its success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint effort, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the CSU's loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP made it into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has managed for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, before yesterday's elections, the opposing party gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would this time "allow" some opposition MPs in parliament.
For this reason, the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia thanks to rising prices for natural gas imports. Loans have even been taken out to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline running through the country, to the Russians. In the background of the opposition's expectations was the hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relations with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians were banned from entering the EU because of the political system in the EU, which is considered anti-democratic.
The OECD election evaluation report provided temporary relief, focusing on positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report on Monday criticized the campaign - according to which opposition members should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is even prepared to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper,  the two territories have been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to allow even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition is not planning protest measures in the face of the results, but rather trying to make the need for economic reform clear to voters.
"We are struggling with a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles in our way in terms of distribution, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime.  whose only merit is the establishment of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe deeds, not words." The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic at the ninth summit, among other global problems.
Today is also the Franco-Indian summit, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While recognising that India is an emerging, democratic superpower that should be given more voices and a say in international affairs, member states have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseilles yesterday.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and chief diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached according to which trade is to be doubled over the next five years, i.e. increased to just over 100 billion euros.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not so ambitious.
With this in mind, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have been legally combined into one agreement, so that air traffic will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively terrorism, which both sides condemned in the strongest possible terms. The convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides blaming the failure.
The EU stressed that it remains committed to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, meanwhile, they are hoping for orders worth EUR 20 billion to French companies for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will be spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour at the event.
Maria Giro, Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be present in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign writers is declining in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sector.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those clever people who first stamp and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Lazy Law" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
">"Rotating doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta emphasizes.
Palazzo Chigi marks the end of the installation in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "the choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from officials, the secretary-general assured: "This process was supported by everyone, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is no longer breakfast during working hours; No more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the High Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the Minister announced that "within three months the absences of civil servants have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"Their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to oppose the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiling himself with figures on lower absences at work - writes the Consumer Center - the people of the 'active lazy' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are also contested.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 accidents occur at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of recent days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro).
The Head of State expresses his "deep appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to assisting the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"An indignant "Basta" has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies which, measured by their magnitude, cause some media hype and public sympathy. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own momentum."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely a resource problem: there must be decisive investment in education and information."
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school settings on the part of young people who are nourishing themselves in the world of work.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be enacted and improved.
For his part, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the consciences of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the possibility that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"We believe that there is basically too little being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – said Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who already start at school".
"A further effort is needed, he adds, in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency is needed".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system, against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not become dependent on voluntary or accidental donations decided from time to time by a legislator".
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music for long periods of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report distributed today in Brussels.
"It is clear from the report, according to a note, that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for more than an hour a week for at least five years risk permanent loss of hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who usually turn portable music players and mobile phones to a high volume are irretrievably damaging their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the EU, the scientific findings show a clear risk that urges swift action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information commons.
In the light of this scientific evidence, we need to review the control systems already in place so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - the EU communication concludes - confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music and similar devices".
There is already a European standard limiting the level of noise from portable music players to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise pollution.
You can limit this damage very much by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the EU's Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music players listen to loud music (louder than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, the legal limits applicable to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who cross this line with music risk complete hearing loss within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of users of such devices, which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it should be over, in June we will take stock.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome". The Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Councils will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno stresses. "It will put forward proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders will remain the city and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a timed endpoint.
In June - the Lord Mayor announced - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence because its opinion lacks binding force replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as the Attali Commission did in France, it delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to keep an eye on a longer period of time in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will make us think. It will employ the best minds in the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, in order to allow our city a qualitative leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the Lord Mayor of Rome, that "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is an explanation
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be seen as independent, has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the economy of the USA through his decisions and who maintained relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private citizen)".
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly fierce, especially as the elections approach.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys; all say that Obama will win by a large margin.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the voting booth will we know who the true American patriot will vote for.
Here comes to light a mentality of the USA that was kept hidden until the very end.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will do our creeping, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you've never heard before – only now that the black candidate's success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush's weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place faces a huge task.
United States. The financial collapse is also leaving its mark on journalists: you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information concerning those responsible.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cuts affecting the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, does not shrink significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at the national level.
In the local area, the figure for executives is as high as 65%.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are making their way into the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted they wanted to join the new technology in the hope that "it would bring something good to journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, compared to only 23% at the local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
Farm managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, the figure is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", editor's note) is always a hot topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers bid as they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief very often get very high wages, the editor, on the other hand, can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pensions and insurance money.
As far as holidays are concerned, things get complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, and finally reach 15 days of vacation after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often get "sick" during the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent. He had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is being investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy, as part of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl. determined.
In the course of the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecution had objected) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain accusatory evidence.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the $700 billion austerity package of the White House: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis is rapidly dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and the neoconservative that is hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, winning voters especially in the South and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is heralding, or even already representing: not only in the United States, but also in the entire West and perhaps beyond, it will be affected.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events which, under these new conditions, are finally taking shape and coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state combined with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means the decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of households living in a single state.
This poses a direct political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, who also represent an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been sidelined and lost its right to speak: the plausible proof of this has been given by the EU, which does not know how to find a common path due to its division into various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; Rescue plans, new rules, and above all distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the USA is in the economic situation to save itself without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that should not be overestimated – under certain circumstances – on which no other international organization and no market will be able to fall back in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the national-national element is, moreover, perfectly in line with the growing importance which has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked empire, into a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we suddenly have to realize how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless outerly connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory has an advantage over another who lives in an area without crops, waterless or free of oil deposits.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief insertion.
Whoever says territory, who says government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to do things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation against the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more worrying aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of inexpediency, a sense of remoteness, all directed at an entire class of managers in Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is paving the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content presents itself to the majority as ever more alien and outdated.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of disempowerment of the ruling class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the electorate and in the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, through the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, has more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West, which is intensified by the financial crisis and driven to the point of oversizedness.
In view of all this, it would simply be an exaggeration to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to be close to its goal.
Using an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 sq cm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "easily removed from the wall," according to Liming Dai, a researcher in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING ALONG WALLS? "This material could be used as an ephemeral adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
To walk up walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the field of space travel.
So for now, the superheroes will have to wait.
THE OTHER KIND OF RESEARCH – the University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, clean themselves from dust by moving on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed especially in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious damage to health if taken at the same time as certain essential medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of them by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with medication. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he sounded the alarm again: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain essential drugs to such an extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus endangers the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
DRUGS AT RISK – In a report two years ago, the same agency of the drug warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix, stressing to pay attention to what is drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or metadon.
IT'S NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive to US history than the attacks.
A prediction that received not a little polemic as an answer and was held against the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals surrounding the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public view," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a trivializer with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package is released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; As a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, the open source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed initial menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS X is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format,  i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Attention was also paid to compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, for example. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
"Hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple hands by different users, avoiding conflicts during changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently in the process of releasing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be announced in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which is on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if the freedom from costs can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, it is also in the field of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the big hit: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program aimed at displacing Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with PowerPoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the more well-known Access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a target that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the context of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is ranked third and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
Team Gerolsteiner's 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider to test positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the cross-checks now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive Epotest, and according to the Associated Press also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed onto the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", who are accepted only with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of biscuits.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those with "the most integration and job opportunities" and yet "the highest levels of anti-immigration sentiment and support for the Northern League."
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And that's not all.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and speeding up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that is also underlined by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism."
Billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane that disappeared a year ago recovered
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight over the Nevada desert, was found.
The individual parts were found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains were found.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson completely dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, whereupon a force has been sent. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane Steve Fossett flew on on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) announced that just a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a crew was sent to identify the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs bearing Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first person to circle the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single non-stop flight.
Among his several records is also a high-altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
An SUV that stands out from conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the sweeping surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this off-roader.
Precisely because of its extraordinary characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October, will also be unconventional.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new guise, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different phases that will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first bevel will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be possible to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right-wing milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to the Italian fans for the game: all of them were issued by name and therefore easy to check.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already prejudiced in this respect, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the tifosi arrested or identified during the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycats who could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that such behavior in no case give the opportunity to justify," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "keep your eyes open, especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in fact there is a small core of Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) will meet, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce shouts and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post from Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the chief of police of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now comes from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their act.
So far, this group had kept itself in check, but now it is necessary to rethink what has happened and what will happen.
But let's also talk about the whistles during Mameli's anthem: this is not a crime either, but allow me, because education is missing...".
Students victims of high rents of up to 900 euros per room
The market for student housing knows no crises.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. In fact, crowds of students lose their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level" – says Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia – "in these cities, the great demand from students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also harmed the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers contain a number of violations: free contracts, lack of registrations, no rent limit, unauthorized subletting.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary measures that lead to lower rental prices through a revision of the taxation.
A closer look at the study reveals that in Milan a place to sleep in the Brianza district requires about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the districts around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the districts around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a place to sleep in a double room.
Only slightly lower are the rents in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who move to the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% above the average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-hall complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the single-hall cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the hallmarks of a cultural crime.
Mostly historical places full of memories are affected, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've covered a stretch of the road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this bill was largely paid by cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions that have registered the largest number of these modern cinemas: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy tops the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way", says Paolo Protti, President of ANEC, "it is useful that new structures are also emerging, but the first priority is the preservation of what already exists, because if a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are willing to go to a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association outer eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral standpoint that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, fearful of the old cinemas, decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax advantages for cinema operators and advantages for the public in terms of public transport: it will be allowed to drive into the traffic-restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking rates.
"It is a welcome initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of multiplex halls, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important theme for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been toying with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations made by the legal profession of the anti-mafia authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Also handcuffed were Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal organizations of the mafia, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting services."
"Thus, it had been made possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to penetrate the town halls through official channels and to have a say in the policy of the public administration."
Agazio Loiero, president of Calabria's regional committee, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep a clean slate."
This morning's arrests follow those made last July, with which, according to police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians had been dismissed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the UDC, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the run-off election of May 2006.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He then prosecuted Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons. The judges, however, explain in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
A wiretapping operation in connection with the Dal Torrione case has shown a willingness to accommodate the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making the measures of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a never-ending source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at and trying to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of ocean energy was forgotten, but now environmental organizations and the rise in oil prices are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be the currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on ocean energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now relying on marine energy generation.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies," a spokesman for a company known to the US giant told the Wall Street Journal, and is considering the possibility of working with us.
This involves obtaining approval from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that should not be underestimated, especially when you consider that oil continues to be produced by the USA in Alaska and that President Bush recently set plans for new wells in motion.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; Although the details are not known, observers speak of increasing interest.
Technologies still in need of improvement.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the move, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small scale and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, producing energy on a large scale requires technologies with a far greater impact on the environment.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater cables.
So far, there are four planned plants of this kind, which are just waiting for the state approval. Some of the energy generated could also be used for military installations.
Meanwhile, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotary movement.
According to Verdant, there is already a long line of potential clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Generation Research, the potential of the tides currently deserves special interest.
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and are therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
