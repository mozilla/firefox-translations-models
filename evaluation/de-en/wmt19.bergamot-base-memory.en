The romantic shoot is in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you come into conversation once, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is laid down in his statement," Grindel told the "Bild-Zeitung" on the football podcast "Phrasenmäher".
Despite the months-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to some point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his retirement from the DFB team in July and also justified it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that "if you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14:13, the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schreberggarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its full and fire debris had to be cleared out to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had attached a battery to the charge at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as does the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What did Lindsay Lohan do to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live, as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adult child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of that in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to pursue the family down the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan is missing a slap.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" spacecraft launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 fatalities.
The number of victims could rise even further.
Rescue crews have not yet entered the devastated and cut-off areas from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla's supervisory board chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro carmaker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk will have to pay, and the Tesla CEO will retire from the supervisory board, but he will be allowed to remain chairman of the board.
Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The congress will focus on foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name-doublings for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population votes on this Sunday - whether it is well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The not") - meant is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" reprocessing takes longer than planned
"The diesel taskforce still exists," development board member Peter Mertens told the industry magazine Automobilwoche.
The jailed and furloughed Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be audited," he had said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we achieved an important milestone in the reappraisal of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had on Friday adjourned a decision on Stadler's future and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values after the exhaust gas frauds became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently manages the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel aspires to re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the office as DFB president again despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it can," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to always strive for re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "strange" in his own words, if he did not "have the desire to work on the future project" after the surcharge for the football European Championship 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairytale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote is at the DFB-Bundestag on 27. September 2019 on.
The future European Championship chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work according to Grindel in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to consult in this role in the Bureau in the future and then of course is welcome to provide his experience with sporting questions," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief executive.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently this office is carried out by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background clearly acts in society and football and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," Grindel said.

A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New signing Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player from Ludwigsburg Johannes Thiemann (18 points) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came in on 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP giants Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most reliable shooter with the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings towered over the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, in whom NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owners since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdogan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne's city centre had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were on duty - including snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is under criticism for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, booing and scare
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have advocated for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a scare second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunfire, got scared and tried to escape.
Briefly panic arose, people ran into a mess.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin, however, calmed people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet, as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - booing, on the other hand, for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, and thus pushed many women in the head.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who said they themselves experienced sexual assault, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet with me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's ejection
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ejection of a journalist from Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) press conference and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
It was about a disruption of the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action caused a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He caused personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is making the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15. July 2016 responsible.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbor pub "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebs also drink courage for the obligatory vocal interludes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The horniest day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the far north but not at all good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - arguably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: never goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of eggnog, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves out.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - presumably the most expedient - headache pills.
Others simply amused themselves about the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking is not yet known.
However, since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to deal with vandalism and debris
The entrance to the 36-kilometre railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and filth, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship object Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the cycling advisory board.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also submitted the topic to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only often loud, the flowing is also destroyed: posts torn from the earth, trash cans demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for sauflage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haasse hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive.”
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this puts the threshold significantly higher to attack on common property.
However, this would require that a police patrol will come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far, one can be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," according to the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger spot, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turn-off lane on the Haaße hill.
In busy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-sided traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with twinkles in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachter living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling
This contest, according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters seem connected to?
At the places, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue in his hit-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about the experience of togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So they learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke knew to report from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
For the favorites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children also performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfass from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
All were "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you - the old trick with the red foil - can only decipher when you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side can not read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, it is then to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Fest."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because here should not be guessed the terms, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may say "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" you should not guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible not; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encryptor therefore notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to the festival; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention in school and knows the window fall there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
Although one does not know the terms of the other side - but can combine these better with every clue that the encryption encoder gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the circumscriptions should be, otherwise it is unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre-primus "codenames", which also puts an agent topic on a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who it is only about guessing and not victory points, can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also stood out in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he did not comply with the granted referral by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be held criminally responsible for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Betriebswerk Pressig was home to the push locomotives
The railway works in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it in all of Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and rattled the wagons.
That was pure railway.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters of altitude has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and push locomotives were previously needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and a career railway operator for 47 years.
The railway works unit (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On the 15. In July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977 they were only needed on freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not envisaged better use of the location, also in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On 1. June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the shunting yard Pressig was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Yulia Putintseva from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the number 13 Russian gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather looked when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened in 15. Year their doors.
A great response to visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the very beginning.
As well as Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to shape flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing, Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windbreak Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often provided with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau awaits.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully provided with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks fairytale-like sunning and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to devote 15 years of K&G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
At halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic of "Windwindle Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31. The special exhibition can be visited in December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50. Birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtens also vented their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albacht.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated big in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50-year anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter", but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was needed: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the knobs and asked for the dance floor.
A matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves sounded the voice.
In keeping with the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Again, the choir was conducted by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He's got such an easy way, it's a feat he's accomplishing." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves vocally.
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented pleasant-sounding poetry.
There was also a large raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatross Youth Center a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself really well in league three.
No sign of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied.” On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish line, such a game can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced powers and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
That doesn't break our necks.
I saw really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three matchdays.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels vindicated: "The 3. League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball.” In the fourth league, they do not want to turn their gaze down anyway.
Should the vest not be sullied in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee kicks on 14. October in Essen.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing," Keller tells Bild am Sonntag.
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it's possible that her then husband might well have been envious, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself," as she further explains.
She always felt that she was “not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I was in truth never, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil marriage, I sat howling in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love too naively.”
The night butterfly, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glaring glow in which a green carpet is dipped on the Sechseläutenplatz blinds it unduly.
But it is just a film festival, since more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he stumbles across the square this late Thursday night to briefly ease himself in the "aquaclean toilet oasis."
This is what the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company is called, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needs facility in the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to the sky.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained in the cinema next door the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate as every year the festival begins with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: As is known, the works on display come from the whole of the globe.
What you don’t have to think of in an article about this festival in order not to fall into creep advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a ribbon around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music or let themselves be set by DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters await slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without much loss.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If there are two separate instructions, he has misspoken in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the winged man dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily awarded to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the said brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But there, between local prominence, box office and kitchen articles, a face passes that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor should not be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost acting like a choirboy, walks through the crowd.
He is not chatted, not gawp, one screehs at most stealthily.
Especially for this restraint, like to misunderstand as uptightness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina football legend Diego Maradona apparently seems to have settled in well in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2:0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division side had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute bankruptcy
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "devastated" after the unlucky 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long periods, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept," the ASV coach teased.
The landlords quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not initially fruit.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Senden's best, Marius Hintze, scored in the phase once and again.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized at 15:15, after which the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervened in the action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking the blame from others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff conceded "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the final attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men at the back and repeatedly threw them on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the completely served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his looming dismissal as chief executive of the billionaire company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled out of court a legal battle over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay 20 million dollars, and Musk also relinquishes the office of chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board chief.
He is allowed to remain chief executive against it.
In the settlement, which still needs to be upheld by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the U.S. federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than 50 billion dollars on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On the 7. August had Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he would perhaps take the company off the stock market and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.

"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Precipiatory Content) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated by mutual agreement and amicably," said the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to "BamS".

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo collects several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a questioning - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives up a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only come to 27 percent.
That's the lowest level so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If there were a federal election on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together get only 43 percent of the vote.
Thus, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they together received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also large: The AfD, in several polls second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach vote shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also dropped significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the chancellery, as the Emnid poll on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently want the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular federal election, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Also in a further poll published on Saturday, significant loss of popularity for Merkel had been seen.
The Germans also judge divided whether Merkel should run for the CDU chairmanship again in December.
47 percent are in favor, according to Emnid, 44 percent against.
Among the Union supporters, 64 percent would like a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Postship at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic introductory stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the dig table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right when in doubt.
The app Tinder is in the reputation of being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We took the test: How do women react, you don't talk around the bush for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
The real Hollywood love story potential is when the happiness of love is preceded by an out-of-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy then also reports to his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For believing in the magic of analog getting to know each other, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Lid against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, referred to in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, who was friends with Götze, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush during contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga football club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sky television on Sunday night.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine takes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard with his own in the court.
He gave himself word-karg, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first retired (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it's running round at Brandhoveweg again.
The 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine is the 1:1 against the SC Altenrheine, last season only wafer-thinly scraped past the climb.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the game, to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited in the front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the substitutes Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA struck dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards narrowly failed.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes on a Thewes entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
As Altenrheines Chris Naberbaumer in the 70. Minute Robin Westhues fell, there was an indirect free kick for the groundsmen 18 yards in front of the guest enclosure.
The fouled man himself competed and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slipper struck at the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left that should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80. Minute the leather in the penalty area unlucky on the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase, before Geske in the 87. Minute from twelve meters still had the victory hit on the push.
Maybe too much of a good thing would have been.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt win 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five matchdays - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting eleven for the first time after an injury, should help with that.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a pubic injury and should prevent the SGE from conceding further goals by standards with his header strength.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, the accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m., a drama occurred at the airfield in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
On the landing of a helicopter, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a stand to a sag.
Immediately, police, rescue and firefighters were notified.
With a large contingent, the emergency services came to the scene of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which could be extinguished quickly.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were at the reporting date 1. September female, as can be seen from the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was submitted to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to line up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes the German competitors in comparison less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive stimulus among companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneering in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will be recruiting more consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: to 1. September was the proportion of women there at 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If there were just as many women recruited annually for the boards, a share of 40 percent would be reached as early as 2023," the report said.
Some even make miese: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put heavily on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge moved under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn through the village to the fairground.
In the already proppenful marquee, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of sorting something like this - that's an insane achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later summed up symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that again so many have found their way to us after Abtswind." Later, "Die Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had fixed the drink prices in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for 60. Wine Festival takes place on Friday, 5. October, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round a day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency medical car crashes into taxi
An ambulance stands badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably even save human lives.
Such a rescue ride took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor's car had run over a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided on an intersection with the taxi, which was driving at Green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by, who still died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency doctor's car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency doctor's car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another summoned emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the embarrassing exit in the League Cup, Manchester United now also lose in the 7. Premier League round.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to still be in the words.
The scene in the 74 was emblematic. Minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored the 3:1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had led the Red Devils supposedly back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defensive players stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of an already insufficient performance over long distances.
The mood at United's city rival Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, came up against Brighton & Hove Albion for an undisclosed 2:0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defensive bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th Minute remained the only hit of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, the one in the 66. Minute for Mohamed Salah came on the field, narrowly missing the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89. Minute with his swerve.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were therefore unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also crashed from the top of the standings.
Like City, the two London city clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to face the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81. Minute tolerated by a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed an entry from Alex Iwobi unlucky into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth consecutive win and is now in 5th place, just behind big rival Tottenham. A strong impression continues to be left by upstart Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row at 2:0 against Southampton in the league, occupying the 8th Place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their innovations from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel is no longer a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt-based company is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3er.
Overall, this year is from 4 to 14. October more than 250 exhibitors represented.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the magnitude 5.9, the second the magnitude 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, enormous property damage was caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will still skyrocket significantly.
The figures so far come only from Palu.
But also numerous other communities are affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Church of Peace in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the Haus Nordhelle takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had come together there on Sunday to celebrate an anything but ordinary service.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the church's entrance portal.
First of all, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical accompaniment was provided by the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-quiet tones," says Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how this would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chopping material, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last work step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already completed specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors to the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf companionship of former soldiers also became involved in the course of the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also in the coming year, the Heimatverein will offer a day of action.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will go round the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth break of the season: "Blissed situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around and gave them courage.
However, there were not much positives to see at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last of the standings at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out of it as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed: "Of course, this is disappointing, because you always take a lot of action".
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) scored for the connection, are at the bottom with two points and are a relegation candidate in their current condition.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th Minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who pushed himself into the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse on his starting eleven debut and never got to grips with Hannover's defence.
The striker, who was long-striked after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to the Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurter for the first time, which began with a lively start.
A header from Lucas Torró (17.), which was falsified on the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term outkeeping Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the home rulers fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a repelled corner, Haller extended by head in front of goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defensive player, who came in the summer from the French second division AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt followed up before the break.
This time Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven, bringing in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little bolder forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when at least the follow-up hit still succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurt against overwhelmed guests only show running, even Jovic scored a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Munich Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter made it in front of an audience of millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14. September or Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who is from the 30-year war and on whom, according to legend, a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room is standing, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geising parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Cross festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has invited to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with savoury food as well as a wide range of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, the roof, the sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined in more detail and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already present a few years ago has become larger, but more have also been determined, which was only possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering work is complete, before the winter the natural stone work is to be started and one hopes to be able to complete a good half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to its destination - everyone present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dorm of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the U.S. Army was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house was getting old and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allows the residents to experience the freedom to move even without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also expressed similarly: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
"The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to the tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to come to terms with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper.
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people of West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to be smoothing the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has gifted South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which was published on 1. October will be released.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not recently invoked the "return to findering" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherly working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mandate - governing - should not be stopped now with term debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks, will probably show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early; a lesson from all this dispute.
First, however, the diesel retrofits and the Immigration of Skilled Workers Act are once again subject to conflict-ridden issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a stay-at-home perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strictly against the "change of lane" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be disputes among the coalition partners again - and how should it be otherwise?
It is not the same and equal that has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Fighting is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, Streit must not again be exaggerated for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or non-being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of life of the people in view.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and lane change questions can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain trust.
That is why the popular parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Does the Minister of Labour violate the current service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" had their legists working on the social security reform, reported an effusive social affairs minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
With list mushroom mandator Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she now brings the matter to parliament via request.
She said she said, "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "acquit Har-tinger of any suspicions".
Police tear up a street in search of woman's body
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, dugs are being carried out on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded by investigators having previously deployed an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide, was finally able to narrow down the relevant place to a few meters in several times.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year, the public prosecutor’s office and the criminal police court have been working on the missing persons case.
Again and again, a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Paint powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia's anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1. In October 2017, there were clashes between separatists and the police in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence supporters with paint powder, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists would then have tried by force to break the police chain, and the officers, among other things, with paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set off abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, are still in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalans' "right to self-determination."
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate goalless
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only enough to a 0:0 draw.
The final light and the third last they turned out in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as assembled perplexity.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a sausage, you could do it without worry.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal kick of the entire game, Gütersloh's Nick Flock drew in the 28th. Minute responsible.
The Ahlenians had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area boundary.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48. Minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just over the housing and after an hour the Güterslohers also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball capture by Matthew Wieccowicz, it went fix.
The quickly presented counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a but lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball by the ex-Ahlenian Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, bringing in first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlenians did not accomplish more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91. Minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance, but even that brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut made an effort to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and that although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "it all splashed a little bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel like we could get a goal," Daut said.
To his chagrin, however, as a spectator, you did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
For that, the performance was too poor.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the space was still a bit empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "It's so nicely sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the increasingly growing visitors in between musically.
This was so well received that at a late hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many active with their stands, including predominantly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he thanked him for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" campaign that took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here's something.
Then the Maikranz was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
Many stands were working for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative on his decupuring saw.
He had veneer work, beer lids with stretching fields motifs and much more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that the visitors then lingered long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smears with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate facility
In Lengerich, unknown persons have advertised in an almost conducive way for the construction of a skate facility.
In several places, there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have filed criminal charges for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were emblazoned on signs at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the career choice fair on the 19th. September a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro was discovered.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign will have to be replaced.
This case is particularly touched by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also named on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city department of school, sports and culture, without mentioning names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The majority of the council finally spoke out in favour of the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
Then the city council has the final say.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Bottleneck in air traffic control gets even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then comes the storm," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on 5. October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control services, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and the airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots lasts four to five years," the unionist said.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will come together on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, it will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federally owned German air traffic control.
Maas again blamed EU Commission guidelines for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period, which run until 2019, were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully impacting the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to campaign in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air even further" to air traffic controls.
Currently, the EU regulations are being agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delay at the airlines initiated a rethink.
The GdF will only participate in the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "voice training and future pact," Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reductions in personnel beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to contain, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is to bundle the elevator and supplies business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations of police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city government, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, when about 6000 independence supporters also demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the emergency forces, however, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
There were also fights between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish policemen demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threshed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because that's a big European city and there's more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, "did not come to provoke," the police officer assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security vulnerability on a mobile phone app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party convention in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The police Hannover reports on Sunday morning a serious traffic accident on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best match
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought-in star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we've grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early backlog by hitting from Dries Mertens (10th. Minute) and hung out the worst pursuer for now.
The goal-scorer, brought in by Real Madrid, first put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work to the goal of defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to push in just before the goal line shortly before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to be becoming even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-point lead over Naples.
The second place in the standings, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the relegation of the already cautioned Mario Rui (58.) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to go off the pitch with yellow-red after getting in too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German international has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was in action on all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant by the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2:0 victory of the Turin and is closed for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you just want to call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince, when the latter dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that's where it means "you,"" according to the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Finished!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was just more handy, we hardly ever put him in front of problems." The list of Hoetmarer bullet possibilities reads correspondingly thin.
Grade times two goal chances in 90 minutes, so that only rarely games can be made positive.
Football Circle League A1: SC Hoetmar subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but the first was used by Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7.).
In the 43. Minute could have increased Steffen Uphus, but after great preliminary work from Krause, he fucked up free-standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne initially failed to score goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other harshly before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to think of it," he wrestled for words.
“We didn’t get access to them.” By that he meant allegedly the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green-whites, who stood out with collective offensive urge.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on his players, on the other hand, was the relief that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we hold against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
It seems all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th Season hit in the lead (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for that goal.
He put the 2:0 on the left side on exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that completely out of it.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent enviously.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed the equaliser: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed through between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45.).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized (69.).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fight points against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the standings had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Full Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigns
The entire executive committee of football second division club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening unanimously invoked a joint letter from the Saxons Panel.
A confirmation of the club was not available at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides such great relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 conferences by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the tolerance price in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". The fact that celebrities appear again and again at the Academy in Tutzing Castle, however, was also a topic in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on the 29th. September is the writer Frido Mann at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: He wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in person in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences until mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit."
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every humane idea."
From the structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting on the 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits some more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret, Teubner pre-seated gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered its violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also speaks until the end of the movement, and a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it matched the Red Thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have sprung from the composing of Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart in G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain chief executive at electric carmaker Tesla but must hand over the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement from August to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in her lawsuit of providing false and misleading disclosures in the process.

Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu said.
But he was more annoyed by the many boisterous chances.
The concentration in the end made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end a backlog, was at the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the broader bench of the hostesses make itself decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), p. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again in the top group of the 3. League West established.
In the second league relegation VC Allbau Essen, the Blue-Whites won with 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the overthrown leader of the standings.
The first round was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Food has taken on in the two-man bar but has not come into play.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has pitched at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the acceptance to triple bars.
We couldn't hold the serve pressure.
Food has sucked itself in, and we have let ourselves be a bit lulled," continued Münch.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region had the lead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern fought off four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the practice manager found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their serves to the fact that the BSV turned the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue-Whites brought passage four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner of the inauguration of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shambles in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be painstakingly swept together," the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, told the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory performance.
"Instead of underlining the membership of Muslims with Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "encouraged many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already become established
After the long summer break, it is finally folk meeting time again.
On the 18. October (Thursday) at 19.30 the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day it is a year since we have held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn’t think that our folk meeting would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermürer, who repeatedly invites friends musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has pledged his accordion for the first folk meeting "birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, who played music with Low German lyrics for many years.
Now he's out with an Irish-folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" delighted the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening again," reads the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 19.30, but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be raised by 24. October is cleared.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are making further progress on the way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
Thus, the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still pending for the billion-dollar merger.
Recently, the chances of approval had improved there, according to an insider, because Linde has promised the sale of additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be raised by 24. October be cleared up for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29. September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses for the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, it was still called differently at that time: As "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district home caretaker Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were to line trunk roads, at schools so-called industrial gardens were created.
The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play as important as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the areas of responsibility of a horticultural association are entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the district chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm emphasized the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can use smartphone & Co. can collect a lot of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district was also left to no doubt by the district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come from the garden, for the winter it was instilled.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the useful garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature endures, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert for fruit and nut trees pleaded.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower winds of the music club Thurnau.

Nafta talks priority: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade deal - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the General Assembly of the United Nations, said her spokesman Adam Austen.
Meanwhile, she is focused on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the U.S. would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the U.S.
The U.S. and Mexico had agreed in August on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a close, Trump's administration wants the settlement before the 1. Presenting October to the U.S. Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo."
After his sacking, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked in early September during a campaign event in southern Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also on the social networks, the associations made racist and women-despising statements mobile against Bolsonaros.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
Brazil's presidential election is on 7. October.
As the former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but now presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be on 28. October a runoff election.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successful from this - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaim Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale outside the gates of Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen in 2010 at the 70th. Birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewrite of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock from three bands friends with each other.
After the sound check and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika convinces at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the performance is danced to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "entiture" shouts are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the longing, downright ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special degree of recognition since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with its performances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In combination with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the felt even higher controlled sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo, whereby he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of this in such a hard rock concert: According to the information of the mixing desk team at the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at compressed air hammer level, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" refers to on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need a deafening 120 decibels in jet shoot volume in jet shoot volume as usual with the annual metal position in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
In a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport, a glider crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed in the exhibition car park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The plane was already approaching the country at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been held since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the driveway to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump sneers at Kim: 'And then we fell in love'
That the US President North Korea's ruler Kim is quite well-liked despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragic thing: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-so-old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although the in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough chunks.
"I was tough, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lip service behind it.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - which is not infamous for his martial threatening gestures, should not be for everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of this during his appearance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How awful, how awful is that?
This is so non-presidential.
But he cares very little, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you, it's so easy to be presidential."
But then out there would not push 10,000 people into this bulging arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler well attended, atmospheric and on top of that full of sun: Very varied and with a good dash of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city center cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the marquee at the fire tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot the recording in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under danger of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria in late August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of his life.
One of his fellow soldiers was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo, said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transiting country for migrants en route from Africa to Europe.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in central Franconia after he had stuck the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon not far from a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after failing to return from a ride on his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has urged the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all waves of arrests, freedom of the press and religion.
He said he had made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of speech would be respected.
Erdogan again emphasized the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport at short notice.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne after the talks.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea makes demand for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of stressing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government at the U.N. general debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The latest gridlock comes from the fact that the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat elaborated.
That punitive measures could "force North Korea to the knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, emphasized Ri.
However, there have been no "appropriate reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the U.N. Security Council had decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations in recent days to strictly comply with the punitive measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT did not know: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came the first day after the summer break the nasty surprise: A power outage had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of order, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And so everyone tackled.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do it any better either," one visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve themselves quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other feats.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board of NRW of the board
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has handed over his post in the state association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as deputy head of the NRW boards, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
I fell in the back of too many.
The head of the Tafel-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa understanding for the decision of his long-time deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor with him.
"I can understand his step - people have spoken out who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel does this."
Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, there is nothing change," says Weilerswist.
Sartor in turn criticized in the "Welt am Sonntag" criticism of colleagues from other panels.
We must not take the approach without us starving the people of the city.
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet cuddly," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, District League Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after backlog - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different from the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to score a 3:0
Gladbach squanders two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke come up against Mainz for their first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke have maneuvered themselves into the offside in the first five league games with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf put the home quip in the lead in the eleventh minute after strong advance work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, in the aftermath the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is newly greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had a 0:2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came in the 2. Half-time still to the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) equalized with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, the one from Favre in the 63rd. Minute was substituted, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
Against the Werder Bremen decimated because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic even before the break, the Stuttgart had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal, which the guests in the 68. Minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful debut, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead out of hand, ultimately playing 2:2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser to the 1:1 with his second Bundesliga goal.
In the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as well as in the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, which came from the OGC Nice, scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach takes the 4th Place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to his team: The 23-year-old Serb conceded yellow-red after a jersey plucker against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game through a curious throw-in own goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the superficially acting Stuttgart back on the victory road.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on track with foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name to North Macedonia.
At a yes, the nearly three-decade smoldering conflict with neighbor Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any approach to Macedonia to the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome to the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and injured them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the escape lane in Alsergrund around 10pm on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went off with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officers.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had struck three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground shortly before in Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He also trampled the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown cause," as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had on 30. June 2017 caused a stir with a fury speech.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since the 1. October 2017 can marry same-sex couples just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," explained the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedge has already been shorn once.
The breakfast that always follows at work also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe slalom World Championships
Augsburg-based Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canoe Lalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough trips here on the facility and everything was fine today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms confidently in the air - knowing full well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had race number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec was second ahead of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspectorate reports the first burglary attempt of this autumn into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of again.
So the police inspection Gauting reported yesterday the first burglary attempt of this autumn.
The fact that it remained with the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators put on their hands shortly before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her so much that she fled without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: caught up in reality: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: FC Bayern "do not want to let down" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dent under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munich to the larger autumnal low.
"A week ago, you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us," Thomas Müller said after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that's why we're going to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away not scored a goal of their own, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as at the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the recently overpowering Bavarians can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with this and that we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he dealt with his losers in his native city surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again inadequate handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to be tightened.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The right-back appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, Bayern were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top again with a one-point lead.
And so Kimmich at least rated positively with a wink that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yeah, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, the Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent topic of dispute Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president fiercely criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the major Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the case in Mainz's ZDF "Sportstudio".
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that such a thing does not repeat itself," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel again declared that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced with sharp words a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They marginalized them from this society because they had themselves photographed with me in England," Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Frankly, as their president, I couldn't digest that our two young men who have ascended to the German national team were marginalized.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan through photos of the two.
At the same time, he announced that he would stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't do that.
"That he has such an impression, I very much regret," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil’s return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed alongside the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background clearly acts into society and football and says: "The topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to make them as good as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal data, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a motorist who would have got off the road and driven against a guard post.
Asked about this, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has lost his way in his place of residence, in which he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 emergency personnel in action.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still busy with the firefighting work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
Since the situation is still stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which a good week earlier on the 21st September was declared because it had been feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and flying sparks.
Thursday, it was then said that an attack of the fire on adjacent communities no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 emergency personnel tried to get the fire under control on site.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
For the 2nd and 5. According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned again in October.
The fire had been sparked by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke plume of the moor fire had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. after their wedding Katharinen in Hamburg.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had on 30. June 2017 caused a stir with a fury speech.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since the 1. October 2017 can marry same-sex couples just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Macedonia referendum on new state name begins
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is what neighbor Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and NATO for almost three decades.
Should the citizens vote yes, they also give the go-ahead for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would be on 30. September turned 90 years old.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that bodies may still only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that bodies may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is expected that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases, a card is found at the decisive moment with possible donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide in the spirit of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
There is a similar registration system in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental calculations
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in mental computing.
He prevailed against 39 fellow contestants at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809.355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Güß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already two years ago as a then 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Head calculations can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented calculation competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
In the calculation of versatility, the candidates receive surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have good chances here, the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because head calculations are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods in early childhood.
Haunting appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up their most intimate spots.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett has died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery has been launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood lumps were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The German government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding draft law on the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groupings covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will shake out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall line drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start annual kink maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start annual kink maintenance on Monday.
The "green ramparts", which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and scrubs up to five meters wide are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were laid out on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time also his name "Knick" comes: By "bucking" of the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image to a wood-rich, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometer of kink, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he withers to a clear row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the kink care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run onto surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but this did not work before and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don't know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came after all.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have run to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had contracted a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián, the series of the most prestigious European festivals closes annually.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, it can be summarized: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire department.

Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire department was able to encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a courageous handle.
The duck, which was injured on the chest, was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for World Cup medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was biathlete Julian Eberhard in the stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the ones to grasp near medal.
Seven-tenths of a second was missing from bronze in the end.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Championship trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already taken the track to my heart," he remembers with joy at his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the last World Cup winter.
With the relay he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the wafer-thin majority for the controversial because of coercion allegations, Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline of Friday to clear up the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been sparked on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer uttered angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared contrary to his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still described the heavy accusations on Thursday as "crappy," initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be cleared up, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely narrowed the powers of investigators.
It will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, nothing more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They do not go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is from Monday, 1, according to the municipality. October, stationed on the garden street.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And it was a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," the Schalke 04 sports executive said - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Royal Blues had still managed to put the close 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under the roof.
It could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 gave the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing", with increasing playing time obviously more and more the head played a role.
Schöpf actually no header monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to put this out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insubstantial part in it with his header: "I'm actually the worst header in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start powerfully in the early stages and make a firework of it," Schalke's head coach said.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the squad and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor," Tedesco said: "You've felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be missed.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at about 13.30 clock observed a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found police and firefighters: An unknown person had lit garbage on a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it seemed as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy with the pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or the other joke, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicted topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly arising despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first rather subdued, then the discussion round is always lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective that two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue because "only when we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he continued to discuss intensively for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off matches
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the open market.
This is announced by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots of land is completed, which the municipality has on more favorable terms and conditions or. Prices offered - similar to the earlier local model.
A good 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently, the documents are being checked" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have created the applicant ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for apartment buildings with probably eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be asphalted soon.
A single property and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots of land in a socially acceptable model.
The municipality's two apartment buildings are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is created on the area of the new Landsham-Süd area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a daycare center is taking place there.
It is intended to accommodate three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's naldo "great sport" succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting eleven: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker starting eleven for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1:0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and thanks head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo, turned on and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who did not hold any grudges despite his renewed reservist existence.
Vorscheinlích knows Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, that he has actually not fallen on the siding of his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting eleven.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained of the rotation, which has also recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also turning out to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Austria is still the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th. Month in a row below the mark of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The bottom line was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index hit its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened downturn could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry - in the third quarter anyway - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as sharply as they have not since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The mood barometer fell to 47.6 points from 49.3 points the previous month.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are collected.
Tuchel's PSG team achieves eighth win in eighth league game
29. September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's soccer championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in the post-match period.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided the interim 2:0.
With that, Paris also succeeded in the dress rehearsal for the seminal second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel’s team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
