No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to request that, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the paragraph on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned prime minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the motion to alleviate the penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the ruling as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised suspicions of the court's bias.
The motion to remove Section 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required to adopt it.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the only question is which - the moderate or the radical ones.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary law of the Sharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand in short.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, possible apostates of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur'an from mutually faming tribes in the future.
In short - there will be an order in Libya that would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly suit variety to the mentioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the infidel dogs.
Their excuse may well be the only fact that the NATO air strikes were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in an exchange of gunfire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are a worry loose - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the petroleum companies get the black gold at a mocking price even without occupation?
Hardly and so the West can finally boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not spoil them with the Sharīʿa representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm low roared through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the 3. Quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France increased.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, as expected, by 0.4%, from France.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than was originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France acknowledged a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to Tsch. The statistical office was thus confirmed by the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the prognancies of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally over-calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy saw growth of 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, consistent with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds climbed the value of 28.45%.
The yield on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is holding below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are heard that the ECB should become the creditor of the last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal from Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a big dose of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing from the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge dose of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1:0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive play of the Czech team, they were only able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be involved in the European Championships next year, it is also gratifying that the domestic football has a premium of approx. 200 million flowing in.
From the first few minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined lengthily and so was played mainly around the center line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team was absent and the wide tees in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living sign.
A few hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the property at noon on Tuesday and subsequently announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Iran's Isfahan formed a vivid sign around the core technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to announce that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed outside the entrance to the complex at noon and subsequently announced the death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program to the greatest extent possible, according to the Israeli press, the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan’s attack would also be from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It doesn't eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys proven - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the milieu is for the healthy development of a person in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the enlightenment campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence."
In families with fats, sport is not exactly one of the favorite activities, which also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week time for active exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools surveyed across the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Obesity is no coincidence", which is supported by the general health insurance and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 have taken on the project. classes part.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with excess weight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, cited eating five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-second-lunch-Vesper-evening bread - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are also important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast for themselves.
Worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family is not eaten at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that you consume in the families of overweight children much more often unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed play sports, only less than half of their parents do so - namely only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own meal plan out of offered opportunities for appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet sodas," is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children hardly liked legumes at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Moving towards health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the enlightenment of the enlightening lecture "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project said.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also ticked poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire than the main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit complained that that was a bit too much fabric for starters.
I didn’t know what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this is going "on the pitch".
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam approaches, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And that's most of us, after all.
Some have a too short neck, others a too boyish figure without neat curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal broad shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging, without her looking too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should at least have a piece tailored to measure.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one off the pole, which always slips up and down, stands out at the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bulging, appliqués, embroidery or gathering.
With this amount of information and figure types, I’m glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that in view of the applied homework task, it is almost impossible to do.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for which she should come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening wear.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on" Miranda Kerr who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I cheer, because that is much better for me personally than, for example, to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained about a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search, print them out on the Internet and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to the specific specification, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture, which was filled with information about figure types, was equally spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And sent-in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on your naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks very different.
"Play with it," he insisted.
But most of all, the following advice was appropriate to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then are you allowed to hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we have to timpanize all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see completely different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
So you have to expect all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something, what I look like is secondary).
And if one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will almost certainly impose a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to find with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has closed or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must above all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a clever psychologist.
Assess people without getting involved and standing by his opinion.
“If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add pretty pieces, then we can’t clear out the whole closet and tell her – my God, that’s terrible.”
"You have to find at least some commendable things to recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "space bag" must include.
So such a bag, which you button up at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, unwinders for hair removal or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (thus the stylist helps to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are gathered at the back, if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited, so that the fabric does not break) and of course sewing tools.
However, so that we not only have to listen, but also try something in practice, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We glued and glued ourselves...
With the scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you have to be really skillful.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend sequel course.
One thing has become clear to me by now - to devote yourself to styling at a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride becomes a routine ride to the early shift through a series of completely avoidable, dilettante error.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions in large part, what good is it, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part, with the subtitle "The Run," raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already-year-old game series "Need for Speed" a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they're quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been more or less present in this series for a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First, one is introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, i.e. on the West Coast, you sit down at the steering wheel - with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment the impression that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still extremely pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shatting.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal scenery or high up through deep snow-covered landscape looks very pleasant visually.
Every now and then, uncharacteristic elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be hellishly careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then a personal duel with a single opponent awaits you.
And the police also interfere, who want to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (specifically probably only three).
Ultimately, this is more of the advantage of the matter, because at least this element has no chance of getting boring - it belongs in the context of the above to the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model progresses in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do justice to an action-packed racing, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only arise after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
From a game of this kind, it is hardly to be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves before any impact on any object, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When driving close overtaking or passing oncoming cars, you only "roam" the other car slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situation you get into a slingshot and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter anymore, but it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last indication of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts all over again..
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, so nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
What is extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be driven through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes two oncoming cars in front of a playful way, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake a here on devil come out.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost no longer know where your head stands.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "to blame" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the track, because this is where you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American sedans for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual localities that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also to gain experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: from the car, to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also associated with the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own achieved results with those of other players and also ensures further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get by car to a subway tunnel (meanwhile), where you rest in the dark on the rails long (mean).
On the speedometer, digits between 150 a 200 km/h (meaning), but there comes suddenly from behind a subway and drives one uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming, but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a scale as wide as possible to young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
Need for Speed: The Run The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned above, we could have claimed with the breast tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfinished.
In a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes with the power of airport headlights in the eye.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
“The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance of individual institutions tangible.”
I didn't expect such a hard war to blaze."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law quite sharply.
She already showed how seriously she takes the motto "Understandable and open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual organs of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and comprehensible way that she could have envyed so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism became loud that he was too unremarkable - a grey official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say it has taken everyone's breath away, how well he has taken the matter.
“He is a person who manages to listen patiently, to communicate with twenty-seven member states and, above all, who has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? Which number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil caps quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lived and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the case of the government during the presidency as a major negative, which had severely harmed the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And there is still the EU's seven-year budget to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which sectors will take priority, which countries will be more and which are less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe."
“If I don’t like something, it’s grayish abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how should I know whether you really crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes in Brussels or whether someone actually wants to ban us from the quargel?
She would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative side than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called. V4 out.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me means: "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and it makes a pretty sour look.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects above all tough rules for the budget policy of the member states in the future.
As much more real, as a "European Federation" she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
“We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of strengthened cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want it to work together and those who do not want to stand quietly away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately boils down to a strong "Europe of different speeds,"" Ms Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues with an impact on the whole of the EU must be discussed by all member states and not only by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longever."
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the hallmark around which the life of the future giant should take place (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which was published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it has remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else all around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope to create even more in the next hundred years," Samuel J said. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson already operated social care of its employees in the 1930s - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out remuneration system for the best newcomers and dealers.
IBM’s long-term relationships with their customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in the promotion of talent from the beginning - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, too, is the current plan that Palmisan will be alternated by a woman at the helm of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far she has held the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstorming in recent years, which have many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, the Harvard Business School professor and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to be present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It's one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product breadth - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcode or even the floppy.
With approx. IBM was the second largest technology company (equal to Apple) this year, with it overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not emotionally bind yourself to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, to leave them again, too.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits involve the largest number of services, software and hardware are one-fifth each.
In 1990, hardware was still the most represented with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, but in the same period it invested $58 billion in purchasing promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept across the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson faithful, who in the midst of the great global economic crisis increased his investment.
So far, it seems that the company IBM is surviving today's crisis without damage.
The value of IBM shares has been rocket-like by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s net profit is growing continually.
IBM’s corporate slogan is that everything can be changed – except the values.
This is another reason why this flexible giant can be expected to also overcome the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was about a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history until the 1980s. Century goes back.
They had technologies such as the famous bullet card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who was the boss of rival company Thomas J. Watson hired to help him manage the company.
This leader then even dwarfed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are based on the invincible culture and identity of the company to this day.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all possible machinery for retail - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the firm, he doubled its revenues to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for a whole forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA to direct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, to man's famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computing production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM is paying off over the past three years is the "Smarter Planet" concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a smart way in areas that are not even planned so far, e.g. also to improve the situation in transport and in urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which is intended to help traders direct the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
IBM founded a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Headquarters is located in Prague and here is also a top team of researchers from world level, which deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would awaken from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," D explained. Rychtářová.
As Darina Rychtářová of the Singer I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, if she had not even dreamed of how this would play out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and back to Říčany after her urging after 30 days, Joseph immediately went along.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, indeed it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the run pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář should leave Iveta Bartošová in the future, then he will certainly not welcome open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to close his days in our common home, I will not chase him out.”
"However, not as a loved one, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," Ms. Rychtářová revealed; but she also said that she had already separated from him emotionally and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him, Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’m staying with Iveta, nothing changes.”
“My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that.”
"The company is running on, I'm taking care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I'm doing the shopping."
"I talk to Darina as normal, but we don't share the bed," J said. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he does not want to prevent it.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that's why I take on all responsibility.
The worst female intuition: What about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female unbatches, they invariably shake some out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few immoralities that let the men the blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does her husband accuse them of being shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one hater a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more with promotions?
Then, in your case, it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite halfway under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can stand to stroll through a clothes shop in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not to try out all (in all sorts of colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Consider how many times you've told your husband - stay out there...
Constant discontent
“Am I not too fat?”
"I'd have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or do gymnastics?"
“Do you like me at all?”
Does it seem familiar to you?
Yes?
Then you are probably also one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly whining about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wipe tiles and dust, chafing the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner because he once again tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you scold the children because the just-sharmed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, when polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not overdo anything and that order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This excessive purity fiddle can ultimately also harm mutual relations and, above all, the calmness in the family.
Stingings
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
“Do you really want to put the old socks on again tomorrow?”
“You don’t just throw a wet towel on the floor.”
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that this puts him on the palm tree.
Of course, this is not badly meant, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, the women might not have to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, there is talk behind the back or even slandered or you forge covenants.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to pan out such topics, such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip in stock.
Hand on heart - that's probably own to all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossip aunts of coarse calibre, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone around them and who pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia to victory with their assistants
Ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr had a large share of Philadelphia's 5:3 victory on the ice in Carolina at Monday's match of the NHL with two assistants, making him again the most prolific Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star's overview was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had predicted a big evening to Giroux.
“Even before the game, I tell him that he’s going to have a hat-trick today.”
I had that in the feeling somehow."
"Every now and then such a feeling comes over," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux already scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A bit later, the second hit also had "a Czech track."
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds deflected his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's among the top three," Jágr paid tribute to his centre.
“I wouldn’t have thought of playing with such a hockey player at the end of my career, like with him.”
"I'm really happy about that."
“I’m cutting my game to me.”
"All those years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the table turns around," Jágr chuckled.
Carolina made play still to drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came close to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia placed itself at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Jaroslav Špaček's Czech defender injured in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third because of an upper body injury.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also paid their lead an unlost in penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high illness-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
“We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players.”
"But there's nothing to be done, we have to deal with that," Jacques Martin said.
“With every change, one wave of attacks after another and we had nothing to counter that.”
“We should have made the game easier and get the puck out of our third.”
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec fended off thirty shots from Tampa Bay, thus contributing significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
Five different shooters had a share of the goals of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the ČSSR at the time: Čedok, sports urist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, and only the elect were allowed to the West at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to Lake Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the travels to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A major paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter had not gone by far.
The so-called. Foreign exchange commitment - the condition for a departure to the West - was only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most Czechs have therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dats - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad to countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that one is no longer aware of today is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the obligation to foreign exchange was lifted to the neighbouring Western European countries, which produced a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept while traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a guesthouse at that time.
A typical feature of Czechs’ trips abroad at the time was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips through charter flights after 1997, which made air travel incredibly cheapened by air travel thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the USA, the Czechs already had currency-free payment transactions with all the highly developed countries in the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are being flied directly from the Czech Republic.
About 100 thousand. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On the 17th In November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely among the most advanced countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time and for the first time in their history they gave more than 15 thousand for a single holiday stay, including the cost at the holiday destination. CZK per capita.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
Czech football has not had a chairman for almost five months and threatens that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no agreement on which electoral rules should be elected.
And without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties would like to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, urging his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarrels between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly evident on the 16th. September, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People’s House in the Smíchov district of Prague for free, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the collection - only the statute-based representatives or the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
In this single point, at least in part agreement was reached, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion a representation on a power of attorney was not permissible.
However, the disputes over the electoral regulations continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring any more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - nothing else is left on the agenda at all.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to in the 3. Go round to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statute-based model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is supposedly ready to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receive at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who would find it best not to bend the electoral regulations, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, even if it is clear that the statute-based electoral regulations are most likely to accommodate Pelta.
“My wish is that it is largely elected according to the statute.”
"So that no nonsensical replacement variants are not invented, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements mainly distinguished himself from Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic, however.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
“The possible qualification of the national team for today’s European Football Championship would certainly contribute to calming the minds.”
"If football is riding the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous.”
“This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to “bend” the regulations for their own purposes.
“Therefore, a renewed blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded.”
"However, I hope that common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - much time to agree all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete at all until the qualifying match.
The charter aircraft, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical fault and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, such as to bring a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the barrage first leg.
Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is supposed to point the new direction for Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into battle for chairman's position because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the Extraordinary General Meeting, could have identified a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have embarked on the battle for this top position at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," Paclík ČTK said.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
“I’ve talked to some people in question in person.”
“It’s hard to believe that some told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík reportedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta would have held the position of chairman.
“In his victory, today’s condition would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go at all.”
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, would get football doubly bad," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone wiretappings to investigate in a corruption affair, but from which Pelta emerged without penalty.
“I don’t know what prestige a victory by Pelta der (ch.) should bring in football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who sees his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees a little more calmly.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the AGM in October, which ended with a fiasco, thinks.
“He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to.”
“He has great skills.”
“I could well imagine him as the head of the national team, for example.”
“But I don’t think he’s capable of running the association as a manager.”
"I'm not putting my nose in matters that I don't understand about," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September that he was behind the dismissal of the refereeing commission with Luďěk Macela at the top, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims he feels up to the role of association chairman.
And in doing so, he draws on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the boss of Pilsen, which celebrated its first triumph in the league with his support in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this one.”
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he would see the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
“This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should be dedicated to.”
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they must also say clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclík also does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan".
Pelta, on the other hand, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“This isn’t exactly ideal.”
"However, it does not make much sense to transfer my shares at the Pilsner Club hypocritically to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will rule out a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make it possible for the FAČR to receive new statutes, which in the future exclude disputes over the electoral regulations from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday trial in Nymburk and believes the election campaign will surely defuse if the Czech selection eventual success.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he wanted to focus on the national team and the extraction of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break would like to help him defend his ideas about the management of football and to present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoting themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
“He feels that it is high time that the association is headed by someone, says the man, who is mainly connected to the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
This is another reason why he thinks he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the Citizens’ Association as a means of attraction for the delegates.
“If I become chairman, I will take care of it personally and am willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work out.”
"This is a principled thing without which he cannot be," Pelta asserts.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognises because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which in turn left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were disparaging and a lot of people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is also why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes, to the national team.
And this should be the figurehead of Czech football.
“I would also strive to end all the affairs – from the Causa Bohemians, to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of last year.”
"Right after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for all football," forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If really the only contentious point should be how to vote in the third round, then we get over it.”
"Football needs credibility and it only wins it back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the previous deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly spoil the mood for many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election, you will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and blame the members of the executive committee for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
“As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole.”
From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to the national selection, professional football, to performance football for the youth.
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything on my own," Rajchl said in the conversation for ČTK.
“I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area.”
And I'm going to hand out tough tasks so that football advances in every segment with miles of steps."
Many would not be exactly delighted about this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, she would now have to start working really hard herself," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considering not running at all.
“I know I’m working 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me who don't constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation for why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me that I can’t give up because others would do it.”
"That's trust that you're not allowed to lose away," he said.
He is also supposedly motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
“In two years we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to throw that away.”
"Processes have been started that will probably only come into their own in a few years and I would not like to see that someone is stopping them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are mainly people who would make the football in such a way that it would only be there for the chosen one.”
I can probably be accused of a lot, but not that I would be partisan.”
“I strive to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also disagrees with the claim that he is just a chairman of the Czechs.
“Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to consider whether you shouldn’t divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of each of which they advanced to the first division.”
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association does not pull together.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to new trust," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
“No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year.”
“Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions.”
He certainly wouldn't want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl judges his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in Ufo look, pompous pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, you can rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past year and a half, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in ornately designed domes, she swam marble puttens waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she recorded it in her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now introduces them in her just published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn’t have much to do with sports, says Meder – only in the water it’s different.
It’s only annoying that swimming fans have to come to terms with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says the Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
Blattering in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
“On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything visually doubles: high vaults, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys something worth knowing about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberé).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich roof bath, you can visit the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton looks at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the goings-on on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three upwardly open bowls, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal protrude into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe you have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, has since been closed.
When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The decay, on the other hand, was countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already passed three phases of construction; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite bath of the pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to examine commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Group CEO will draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it not acceptable, according to a study, that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn speculate.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in the worldwide hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But by now, most experts agree that gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business was "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - including recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodities business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkers with his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks today are damaging the common good."
As the top banking lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly obligatory.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
“Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO would like to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive will not move to the supervisory board, unlike planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to worry - his successor would eventually have to do with it.
One in two would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institut Forsa on 7th and 8th. November interviewed 1001 people.
Only eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that are bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would cancel all investments where money goes into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about canceling their account and moving to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and deteriorated.
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is raved about clear forms, glassy halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer’s pavilion at the time got the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its light and floating-looking steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World's Fair.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, was rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th. Century opened - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable as a museum in terms of space and technology - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, was enforced.
Husslein-Arco, a doctored in art history with a considerable career, among other things in his youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, enforced the reconstruction strongly with politicians and preservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal cast.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "enormously important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy slingshot," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light ditch between the house and the road provides the exposure, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tails pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection shade.
And the cinema is even exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also pleased the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "arouse a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban development stroke of luck has occurred: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is just being created.
And another stroke of luck will perhaps occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you can hear, it is already negotiating with the city for a neighborly location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter crisis package in the millions
The railway has come up with a crisis plan designed to prevent train cancellations in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train cancellations and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an in-house crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This should achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, a doubling of the internal and external employees for the snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people is planned.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary switches.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned after a top meeting with government and industry of train cancellations and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
For example, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been struggling for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank to pay million-dollar fine in US
After the tumult around boss Josef Ackermann, new hardship comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about selling mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole range of major banks of having tempted the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and tore the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank did not take any blame with the settlement.
That also applies to Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the concession of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is in charge of the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes at bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion-dollar damages incurred.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also pre-buttoned other major banks, suing JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs, in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events date back several years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the USA.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to receive redress or prosecute misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having over-the-county $200 billion in capital financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage transactions.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit brought by FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt residents stand for "substantial losses" without, however, specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as baseless and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought up more than tens of billions of dollars worth of shares.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, because the long-term development of the companies could be poorly predicted.
However, he has now read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed on the US economic channel CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which had still provided decent profits even in the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said on strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as data center operation for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had rather avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed, for example, on a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 subsidiaries, its holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the Buffett investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent on a pre-exchange basis.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to get in, however.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the uncovering of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small business owner in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, a long-dead ghost is returning: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing quagmin.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: It recalled the victims of racist violence over the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which references the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" also fails to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered who have paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The action of the police and their subsequent search success is discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors are surprised why the German authorities did not find suspects in right-wing extremist circles much sooner.
Some are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If you continue to be sloppy here, the migrants have no choice but self-defense and armament".
“This will probably be the best self-protection.”
"The quality of the enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen arson attack, he sent a stelegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral service in Cologne - Kinkel listed in his speech at the time how many levies the local Turks paid.
As if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax levies.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurií
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
Now a German should judge it.
Axel Weber certainly hadn’t thought so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and dropped friendly remarks about future colleagues.
“UBS has made the turnaround.”
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS trader in London had bypassed all of the bank's security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only praised in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered to be ailing - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed an induction period.
With one stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it has long earned the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid but also buffed-out Swiss asset manager had combined her with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big deal in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she had advanced into the league of the world's biggest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich tells Hans Geiger: "I always presented UBS to my students at that time as a pattern of a good bank."
“From today’s point of view, one wonders: How could I have been so wrong?”
He was hugely wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was going wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, it was suspected why he had left.
The bank's investment division had gambled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but those about whom some would have rumped their noses until shortly before: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so concealed that you did not even learn its name.
But that was just the first blow.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, and in 2006 the second best-paid Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned.
The disaster followed in October 2008: UBS was facing collapse in the face of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a forced change bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
After all, UBS’s total assets in 2007 were more than five times as large as Switzerland’s economic output (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty surcharge.
UBS was more or less openly aware of having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through the mis-speculations and in asset management through help for tax evasion.
And just when things got a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS would be able to do it again, this unfortunate trader story follows: A single trader gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: With the risk management in investment banking, it still obviously still does not work.
"With the Adoboli case, one has had to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the banking institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a major German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: not too big a risk, but security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic, the world might collapse.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are sumptuous, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The UBS reception room is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign to the "Safe".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
However, both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have supplanted this idea of the Swiss bank at some point - or reveal how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he, like all Swiss bankers, also does business with the two major banks.
UBS has become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say there.
“And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.”
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On the 15th The disaster became visible in October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small country of seven millions decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash."
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros, to save the big bank facing bankruptcy.
How did it come to this?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
The result was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and kept growing.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers cheaply came to a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the highly intellectual, humble who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked his way up from banking teaching to the very top.”
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
What is clear is that cockiness came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the executive meetings at which Group CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: push Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables," the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where UBS wanted to go to the top.
She had already succeeded in a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
However, management consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "Fixed Income," there was a huge gap from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed securities on American mortgage loans - but also retained risks itself.
Even when other banks have long sought the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at UBS became a sling seat and are still shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he should permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the investment bank back to the mid-nineties.
He cuts 3500 jobs.
That's not going to be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
Publicly, he only says that he will look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe weigh on U.S. stock market
The looming recession in Europe has taken away the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without a force.
The throttled industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were again pushing into the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financials in particular were on the sell slips.
The Dow Jones index of defaults was trading at the close of trading, down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer commuted between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange's index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 eurozone countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the recovery.
Companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the statistics office Eurostat.
That made U.S. investors sceptical: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there are also further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything possible to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and had it listed almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per unit and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Shares of Bank of America declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house is silver-plating almost the entire rest of its shares in China Construction Bank, slashing $6.6 billion for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institute primarily wants to increase its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased, thus limiting the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777-range aircraft on Sunday, putting the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, revenues of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, in 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others they want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
So far, a remedy against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be found out of the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over Germany advised on possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing development and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are located in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the slaying with sticks as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the grievance, does nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer has noted.
Spraying nests with water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals dodge, large colonies split up and spread in other places.”
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities could not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of the animals from sensitive living areas and lure-offers is conceivable in order to resettle them in other places.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws" advertised the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different handling of the animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple in the face".
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg crow teaching trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use aids to get a treat, but also produce their tools themselves as a tool.
Behavioral scientists at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they purposefully realized what size and shape a stone must have to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the smart crows then had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid pieces of wire for them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo scores Portugal to the Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth European Championship participation in a row perfect after the 0:0 from the first leg.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off return leg with outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also let nothing burn in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland clinched a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade fmeter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a custom-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free-kick from around 30 yards to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range shot qualities and scored from 25 yards to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance through goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from English leader Manchester City put a header to the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Afterwards, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding took centre stage.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade metre after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely converted.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-European champion made it all clear with four hits.
For Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek finished in the 81st. Minute also the last doubts.
This means that the 1976 European Champion will go to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. However, FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a frightening second in the initial phase.
Final man Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th. Minute from the spin from the penalty area boundary just narrowly past Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the Czechs' already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the striker of FC Seoul had pulled off (50th).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the soccer miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the rebounder in goal.
After the second of horror, however, Croatia increasingly took control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who started at 62. Minute for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic made way, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the first leg, in the 32. Minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equalized for the guests.
Ireland pressed on the pace from the start, but had to go until the 23rd Wait minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian back team prevented the possible leadership hit.
In the 32. Minute was the time.
After an accidental defense from closing man Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow by 2015, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," co-chief executive Bill McDermott announced at a customer show in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from the current level of about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase revenue to €20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had raised around €12.5 billion.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55 000 people worldwide, is running virtually rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror" begins sensitively and generously heartedly. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of major characters that goes to your heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel-like narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments where, like Englund's men and women, you are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not inaccurately describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war combined, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limb, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was just the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and terror" wanders with expert views over other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book include bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetseflies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, which smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and hears cannon fire in the distance. Will you stay or take flight?
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged in the first place.
"A lack of facts," says Englund, "have been upgraded with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in England’s losing collection of small moments.
Many of them are about lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the substitute dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and was most recently served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were soaked with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says of the war: "You feel that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to pretend that such a facade means civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind their own strengthened and fogged-up shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"When you refrain from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe, which is falling apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word skilled and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a custom-made suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a sexually transmitted disease in a prostitute in order to escape the frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital in this way," he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eye, which caused them to be blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a one-time way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read about in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it's like he snatched away with his book this page with the main characters in front of his nose and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing operational helmets.
They had decided on the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and few senior officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed they were taking part in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the onset of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the squatters a huge increase in public sympathies, were not allowed to be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by watching occupations in other cities being handled.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid laying of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, what a declaration spoke as "exercise."
"The few police officers involved to my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wishes to remain anonymous.
“The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the department’s senior officials.”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On the 14. October officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including Einsatzkommandos from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers stood in front of the descent at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge ready.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that roared from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched by 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park. And they said the officials' handling had been very rough.
Mr Browne said television cars could have taken pictures on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westwards through the great confusion of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, they were following the city cleaning, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter tied together by her arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr. Kelly said, until approx. 3:30 a.m. no arrests made in the park.
The eviction was complete after 75 minutes, according to police statements.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to "inappropriate behavior and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the department's chief executive, the department's highest uniformed official.
Phil T. Pulaski, the crime investigators' department chief, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not direct the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were erected.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the periphery further and further around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were being watched driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of caregivers will file suit against the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the layoffs are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility still open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid employees and on the 7th. October in a move had lost their jobs, which union leaders described as political revenge for the fact that last year the city had been denied access to a health fund maintained by the working groups, with which the budget gap was to be closed.
This allegation was categorically denied by the authorities.
At a City Council hearing, Dennis M said. Walcott, director of the schools, last month, that the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back, explaining to him that nothing in the budget specifies that employees of the school aid would be laid off.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education against a lawsuit. There will be a press conference on Wednesday at which the filing of the lawsuit will be formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will be Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education list as defendants and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latino women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city did not have the lawsuit and thus could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit draft submitted to the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. She claims poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
She demonstrates that while there have been no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers have lost at District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 aid workers have been laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S. The budget of the 36. Districts were cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" in the U.S. usually describes a teacher's switch from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," the lawsuit said.
Mission ended, Congress ready, agree on Libya
Ultimately, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee adopted a resolution to Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is under the credit of Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
“She is a confirmation of the support of her democratic efforts by two parties.”
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the choice of words of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the U.S. military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and no vote was reached.
Yet on the same day, that law fell through in the Senate. In addition, the board overruled a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that, while upset enough to criticize Obama's approach under the mission, it was not angry enough to finally pull the ground away from him underfoot.
Then Congress's indecision was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell among Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi turned 20. October killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31. October.
Now, perhaps, the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the panel for foreign relations or will they divide lawmakers, as the June law did?
The last version is met with the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it's up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional legislative session of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional change to the budget or any other area currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far unsuccessfully tried to put their changes to the vote, though they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, encompassing a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same bill was put forward to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their principals - especially beginners with Republicans who want to polish up their resume - the opportunity to boast that they have "authored" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex people, as is a change that prohibits burning flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eagerly as the members propose changes, they are moving so much faster as in previous years.
In the 111. Congress submitted 77 such amendments to lawmakers. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
Yet they weren't much more successful than today's either.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from close range during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared Monday night on national television. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20," she rang for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back, has done.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the assassination attempt in January, which killed six people and injured 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Quite well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special recorded just before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A Story About Courage and Hope."
The special has tracked Gifford's recovery since the 8th assassination attempt. January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists show her performing simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitch with your lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You can see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he was Giffords on the 12. March had read an article by a daily newspaper about the assassination attempt when it interrupted it and first asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination attempt.
Suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated medically while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
“Tough, hard, hard.”
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated"?"" Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him at a cue.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not. It was compassion.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has its price, service members say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if the people in uniform are hurting her.
"We were by no means victims," Brigade general Sean B said. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the anger that the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about pity in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, the Colonel warned a.D. Mark Cancian before people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at her with a sense of reverence, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angerous, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an upscale state post in Washington after returning.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the questioners were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely singled out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as one nation, no longer value military heroism as was absolutely customary in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervening in a rape in the military court.
Should it fail to happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Oper-freed Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th Weeks pregnant when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she encountered a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan brushed aside her concerns.
I was like, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
“I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on the 18th. November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it will be decided whether to file a lawsuit they have brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but they rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically constructed," she says.
“Who are the individual persons who are in a position to exterminate the culture of retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to keep up the pressure.
The Defense Department's team, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has made a request to dismiss lawsuit.
The court's files, which are available to Newsweek, list in detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or previous soldiers for injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for any injuries inflicted on active duty.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Department of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with native women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat operations.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Independently of this, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military, in which one focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that received rape victims to release them from service - a common course of action, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed suit against the Veterans Administration in December, in which she accused her of discriminatory practices in her handling of performance claims for individuals who claimed to have been sexually abused on duty.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
Yet most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure is taken into account approx. 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the recorded cases in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole host of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember well the day the verdict was read out," Lyman says.
“I thought the labor would be on. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
“They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: This was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was told to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so she would not receive any support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed will move forward is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine throughout my life.
The military lags behind a decade, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrent that a liability entails.
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it's important for them that they try."
These things will change only when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys broadcasting her anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed in a rampage in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page's advertising tool to precisely set their desired demographics with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their level of education, attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain sitting behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends like in "likes," text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content a day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of that page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you don't normally reach with your clipboard on the road.
“If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them.”
"They first had to inform the party and they would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
“On Facebook, all this falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say the site provides a way to detect and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full-on rush on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on this issue.
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example residential counselors, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle told the Washington Post.
“We found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise.”
Facebook is also constantly tapping the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Fortune Index (using primarily information that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data discovery pit available to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the page is watching them, whether they want to or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to apply your own personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles at all," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
“As for her, it was all about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant will be absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still happening offline.”
'Cold and inhumane': Anders Behring Breivik appears in a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to two rampages that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he said outside a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I object to the court, as you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the laws, but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, he has four weeks no access to the media. He said authorities will closely control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he would stay behind the lock and bolt.
All took part with the aim that everything boils down to a way.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and looked calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
It may please some that the attacks of the 22. July seemingly was the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does that automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the relative of one victim.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 lessons of interview with late Steve Jobs shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5. October, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the important markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Specialist Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, during which they had one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
By that time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing from delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which is coming to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for abhorring in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he reacts seemingly impatiently to Cringely's questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or side stories of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somehow eerily far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs'. But seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the go to greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
“Throughout the years in business, I always ask, ‘Why are you doing things?’ And the answer you always get is, "Oh, it's just made that way."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks about things in depth.
I've noticed that.
Jobs continues to carry out his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded - mostly one started with "standard costs," which were quantified for mere guess and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff half a dozen times around the globe and when you shouted into the phone, it came out again a minute later in the phone next door," Jobs says gigglingly.
“We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while they could imitate Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs was given a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
“That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I'd seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some circuit boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember resounding arguments... They shouted at me that it would take me five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slackening:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?”
You own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if that could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
They caught the defeat from the win.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your intricacies.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it boils down to taste, it boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff people have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether one will hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit that 26 states have brought against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists throughout the U.S.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to be the result of which will presumably boost the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim the law is to be overturned is presumably Paul Clement, once attorney general under the George W government. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the federalist society's annual dinner, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contests the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is hugely involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Republican factional leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges free themselves from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states the following: "A judge may participate in charity events law near and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such event."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, were enough to alert morality-and-government activists.
"This startling break with morality and the opposition to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the U.S.
"The judges won and dinned during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matter too easily with groups guided by the agenda, such as federal society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal appeals came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case for bias, as she was too heavily engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan makes no attempt to do this.
Boeing pulls record $18 trillion order ashore
Airline Emirates is ordering 50 two-speed Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really rare news that a company is getting an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's big business if the company is the planemaker Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 aircraft in total is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need $450 trillion worth of 2,520 aircraft over the coming 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order ever for commercial aircraft over the weekend, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will bring the entire list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered enormously, which greatly improves passengers' petrol consumption and comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.”
Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the planes. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
That's important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices go up, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms Boeing's leadership position in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep Airbus's competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister seemingly loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug trafficker has backed opponents Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's election.
“They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... They have occupied voting booths, built roadblocks ... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have only narrowly beaten Claderon, who had still led in the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been ruled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have dropped out of local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan also seem.
The man who will presumably represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory will make us look boldly into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
Asia's Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the eurozone's rescue in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will curb Asia's growth.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB, based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest-growing economic nations must do "everything in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which are "passionately" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources by Asia is helping to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some degree, but it is not immune.”
“So if China and India can help, it’s by any means.”
Europe's monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is stoking fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls that leading emerging economies must come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support for Asia will be channeled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as buying bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offered greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flow.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
“We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the U.S. Brown University, said that it would be politically very hard to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 trillion people in India, more than $800 million of whom are living out of 2, or even less on the day.
“At some point, they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Similarly, Lee Howell, administrative director of the World Economic Forum, asked why India’s reserves should be used to retain the numerous and well-paid public sector employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losses-instating facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB's forecast with economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ now threatens "the risk of grading" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital churn of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up to Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. In doing so, he triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking through $450 trillion cuts over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a deal in spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts, as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to take a leave of absence from civilians to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert.”
The cuts were ultimately hit by the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the counterterrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
“Personnel settings have been cut, which would lead to delays in the settings and the hiring oversight that support the war.”
“The salaries of staff would be cut, resulting in late payments to wartime traders and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of a seizure by the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not a result that should be imposed on us.”
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their occurrence should not be permitted.”
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or will step up demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly uttered the possible cuts, though he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be imminent - a military with shell but without a core.
“It’s a ship without sailors.”
“It’s a brigade without ammunition.”
“It’s an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots.”
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers, capable of completing the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morale and alertness and that is unable to take on potential opponents.”
“She actually makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious constraints on our worldwide capability for deployment and intervention, resulting in unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, which Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but the proponents say it is an important next step towards armament, so that possible dangers from China and other adversaries can be banned.
How to Unmask a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy meeting the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. The two sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's management is accused of perjury as one allegedly withheld reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself as he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in campaign funding, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam responses so that they themselves stood up well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception are we experiencing?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
However, many of these lies are considered emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or “Uncovering lies” is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a board game such as charades, in which the goal is to shout "Hab dich!", revealing a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look you in the eye.
They do not always stutter, stammer, blush and fidget.
From this, however, one must not conclude that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
A skilled lying defuser can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of exposure. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find our way around our complex world, especially if hiring or questioning people or negotiations or administration are among one’s own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions. And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverts are more likely to lie than introverts, that men are more likely to label "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when one person has been exposed as a culprit, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing this person’s normal behavior.
This is called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually trips with their foot all the time, so they don't unjustly accuse him of tripping with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that are ringing, not as evidence of exposure.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in significant ways or show a "relaxation after the hiring conversation," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a job interview is over, only to keep an eye out for the job interview after that relaxation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip-up is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his slain wife was still alive and sparking a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when one repeats a tricky question across the globe.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and belief."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells ring.
There is no magic tool for unmasking lies, but you can learn skills that allow exposure.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of fraudsters less often, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline to be revised after exposure to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, causing the unions to be disgruntled and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be rerouted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at Nebraska's Parliament building.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed, until the new possible course was checked, which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may adjourn a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was linked to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to pass through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
Yet Nebraska's lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was contracted to conduct the original trial was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged as she allegedly forced a toddler to vomit for fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle would have been given a raby attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have left her young daughter so scared that she threw herself in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade so scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "enhanced fear of strangers," her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on the 10. November last year, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to set off for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk walked her luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
“Someone appeared behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?’ I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle furiously admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't drop off your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I'm not interested in what you say or think.""
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to dump water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look, what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he did not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to the children's cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm.”
Climate adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and stoked high hopes regarding economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of the climatic adversity, there can be no talk of growth, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the millions in agriculture, but also set tight limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, which is mainly due to the historical reduction of agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a braking effect on other economic sectors.
According to one from the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) report on the effects of the frost was damaged to 582 000 hectares of agricultural lands, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed. Above all, the cultivation of vegetables, corn and chickpea was affected.
The decline in economic activity by November has caused unemployment to rise continuously in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
“What we are currently observing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funding from the legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are banned from accumulating dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, particularly in the United States, has declined. This is due, on the one hand, to the entry problems and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of undeclared work. According to INEGI, this comprises 60.38 percent of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Governmental Employment and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September; that is very much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and growing unemployment, the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630 $597 from January to June, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143 312 in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) in turn recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies from the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which were to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The Land Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be found until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of government Mario López Valdés made clear incapacity for government.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), held that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
“The economic activity in Sinaloa was really poor this year. Hard work needs to be done to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the government team, which has already been well-attuned, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López expressed that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently in motion to create economic dynamics that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefining a vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (American Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to do more dynamic productive activities.
“In general, we have observed that work was being done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program for the redefinition of the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that steers the government's efforts in better directions.
“In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
“There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he expressed.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 day sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor's office announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal offence against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trafficking.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was issued on 7. Junio 2010 by Mexican military personnel in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road opposite the guard post No. 80 arrested in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the criminal is still in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed or only with great delay due to a lack of funds, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the municipal authority for social development explained that although the construction programs have already progressed, they are now in danger, since the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to nearly 50 million peso, 25 percent of which fell on the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction was to be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part in July," he said. “In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money.”
He emphasized that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign. That would be in line with the amount the central government should have raised.
“We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Even though the state authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, requested that the administrative work be speeded up and the outstanding share to be paid out as soon as possible.
“Nearly 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny.”
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogue signals to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switchover from analog to digital signals must be moved from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate was rejected, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality. This is how the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree to be unconstitutional, since the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations concerning the radio and television, which is why the Legislative Decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law.
For the benefit of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves were right.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the legislative decree. After the actions were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and discontinued all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government must not regulate with general regulations the measures that the public administration is to take.
“I also don’t think that if you did, the independence of the regulator would be compromised.” She also recalled that for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because this leads the affairs of state.
The replacement of the analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the conversion, she said, was a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest that does not only have technical aspects, because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects.
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the whole system necessary, according to the principle of economic direction by the state, they included a group of features that placed the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government intervened in the powers of Congress with the issuance of the appealed legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballots is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, has reminded that just last 9. November the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations on the harmonization of local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution or his electoral law, nor his electoral justice law, to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not come into force at this round of voting. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines provided for this purpose, with the argument that they still had objections to it.
On the 9th In November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the state commissioner's voice on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and unlawful" as it did not have the right to "decide or veto it."
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of the individual counting of the votes, that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes are not consistent; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not available in accordance with the file or it is not in the possession of the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the overall counting of the fully completed ballot papers can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the party or party. coalition leader before, who is the second of the named candidates.
The counting of votes can also be carried out in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has finished second. In this case, the election packages suspended to a partial count would be ruled out.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the funeral show and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will was that his ashes be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others killed in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane. The next-to-exist people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock at noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the mourning hall, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Technological Institute. This morgue was caused by his former classmates from the technical high school diploma and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for high school.
“He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, announced.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he had stood in the fullness of his life. “He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family.”
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place of Saltillo very young to join the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even be dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good man. “He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo.”
The young man remembers that he had even gone to Zapopán to graduate from his family member at the age of seven. That's why he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: fly a plane.
One last goodbye
The lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was passed with all honors under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. The people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military territory, the Mexican air force, headmasters and students of the Saltillo technological education institution, where he studied in 1985 and stood out as excellent both in studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he had flown, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were also sitting, crashed.
At 18.05, the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the forecourt of the barracks. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found by gunfire into different parts of the body and a shot of mercy murdered in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at kilometer point 1.5 of the country road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood open wide.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately told the relevant authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him lay another, who was dressed in a white top.
Just under a meter away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in a different location, as no shell casings were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition, several bullets were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, initially on the 11th In November, eight people arrested and a prisoner freed in the settlement of Los Alveros.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. Those arrested confirmed to be members of the "Los Zetas" criminal group.
On the 12. At 06.00 a.m., military personnel found a car without license plates with two occupants on their guard in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
When inspecting the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on the 13th November at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Wednesday Education of the new Italian government
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that is intended to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that is intended to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A notice from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed of a majority technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of the government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well staked out," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of the debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package demanded by eurozone politicians to regain ailing confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush, which weighs on Monti, was further intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were burdened with 7 percent interest for 10 years. This corresponds to the status at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the best of our ability."
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats-based government that is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delay of the reforms could once again bring about a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also putting pressure on its suggestion that a failure of Monti is a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday night, the session round is scheduled to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely quick change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a €1.8 trillion public debt would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predicting that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressures of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreement between the games make the inclusion of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more game opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have over 50 international matches on the hump.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries, set up for the friendly match, which takes place today at 15.05 at the San José National Stadium, are compared.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection matches, the three-coloured team has only the defensive player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international fixtures under the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta at 126 and Schalke centre-forward, Raúl González, with 102.
The number hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the fewest games.
Less than 30 matches are played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the part of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't even approach the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
Spain's storied goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence
“Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that will come true”
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected to spend more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
That was assured by the group's bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 19.30.
You read an excerpt from the conversation, the complete copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream come true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that will also be realized for us.
This is just the second time we've been playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to get our music there.
I ask you this because the band's fans are totally devoted. You will experience the days before the concert intensively.
What do you think of your most avid fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've had in the last 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We played at a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to surf. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. This way, about people who love surfing, we've learned about it.
With a view of the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we set no boundaries.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we will play is not easy.
When we include two or three songs that we haven’t played in a long time in the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited about bringing out music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are happy to still be friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to stay with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and besides, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds that love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has launched without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who set up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. I'm sure it'll be exciting.
Why do you change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter whenever you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who did you become a bassist influenced by?
From so many+
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I can think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could seem a bit frivolous. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
To both of them came the tears when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. when you lose a family member or a friend - that will affect your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came to the hospital again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his GP informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several conditions, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on and under control four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He has undergone surgery on tongue cancer four times and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly operating during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official secondment, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch its visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. That, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his fully booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information about all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, since November. Since January this year, an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double investment with the South American country.
The Uruguayan government has sought in recent years to speed up the concretization of agreements on tax information exchanges in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This is what countries are concerned that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement has been in place between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustached installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the store counters of all the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can be used to play three-dimensionally without any special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the person in charge of the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez declared that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo to be developed for this console from the beginning" because until now, successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson underlined that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" included two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less chevered users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" about the different game levels, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", it must always be played three-dimensionally.
This excursion Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The mustache-bearded installer must overcome platforms peppered with danger to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom vouches for Portillo's delivery to the United States
Guatemala's president, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible for the $70 million conspiracy to launder money in the United States.
Thus, the trial over the U.S. request for extradition from Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision based on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered in court decisions and had granted all extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to convict the former president of the state (2000 -2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited when his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million quetzales at the Defense Department during his reign. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister lodged an objection and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was launched to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organisation Trinijove have produced important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took part, took stock yesterday.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems that were at risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous responsible persons of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during election campaign times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green councillor Ricard Goma took part in the celebrations.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were hosted was cleared
The homeowners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona) occupied.
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have come to an end on the street Balmes.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was carried out on judicial order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be controlled," the property manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical facility and part of the water supply with them. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also sustained damage from it.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business would have declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while these cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure restaurant had been reported by the neighbors for disturbing the rest, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the festivals, which were organized there, and which, according to the statements of the disgruntled neighbors, became more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The person in charge of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not having to pay rent for the past nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from the neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for the building to be cleared immediately and to get to grips with the problems of civil coexistence as well as the coming down of the district.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated into all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in recent months. In some, thefts had even occurred.
With that in mind, he added that "it was necessary to put an end to impunity and crack down on the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris neighbourhood was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 15.30, the police approached the street Montral No. 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people want to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The municipal tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its rebuke on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is among the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
Central Park no longer served as a model, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogi bear.
So far was when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone is going to put gates on the countryside.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for proposals is not only the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona, but also from an organizational point of view, but also with regard to a reflection on the city.
It is almost a recurrent topic that two members of this old-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back on.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare correspondences between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call for proposals is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been played out over the green apples.
“One should start from the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" holds a "lexical trap" in itself: one must not "imagine it as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, considers the proposal an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers."
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty that the design of a public space entails today" after the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is the own limitation to what may be built.
"To narrow down something always means to define the next step," i.e. to cross it.
“One has to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real catastrophe.”
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says that the side of Collserola, which is heading towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not heading towards Barcelona," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate de Collserola that should not "fall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the escort letter that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams launched ("just the right thing," he says, "We architects should just be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, since a global view of Collserola is lacking in the tendering conditions: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the mountain sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area considers in its entirety."
That, at least in his case, has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length in such a way that a soft transition between the city and green zones is created.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal, who is free
After 72 days of silence, the authorized representative of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial, which is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red awarded him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is conducting the trial of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination attempt on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which presumably forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, prosecutors opened criminal proceedings against the panist mayor's brother, who was on the 2nd. September was arrested for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In that place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the ministerial officer of the Ministerio Público discarded the offences for bribery and organised crime.
On the 19th In October, he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the middle security wing, as death threats were made against him.
Authorities allowed him to take part in the court case as the inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza municipal prison.
On the 25th October he was served a detention decree by the secretary of the District's Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez. He found that, after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to plead guilty to Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor to issue the punishment, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had repaired the damage and which the owner of the betting house had pronounced his forgiveness. The lawyer, however, held back the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. Also in the following, no objections can be filed against the trial, in addition, no compensation is demanded.
After the hearing of the representative of the betting house at around 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be put to the files.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the plane crash that killed the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people died, indicate that the helicopter with all its intact structure has hit the ground directly without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before takeoff that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
“The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts.”
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting the staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
“In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the mark-up affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an obliquene of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial at a cruising speed during the impact and the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
“This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact.”
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In line with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state, some low-hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight path before the impact.
Scattering of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to this point indicates that the helicopter had bounced from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter had hit the ground with its unscathed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has an obliquene of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a meticulous search on an area that went beyond the cordoned-off area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the unscathed aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Mexican Social Security Institution is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence," which aims to use the genetic markers to be found in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department of medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the Clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests with children and young people are carried out.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and since the 8th. October will continue on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study is to get to know the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that it is intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on the aforementioned Saturdays, the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 found that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. The overweightness has also increased dramatically," emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would be determined whether they had a degree of overweightness or obesity.
It would even investigate the presence of dark folds of skin in the neck and on the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all the measurement results to the parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, to spend most of the day in front of the TV and use means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were paid to the signs emanating from the pavement, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying out and maintenance of the asphalt flooring is reduced.
In his lecture "Potholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which, however, has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic tough-elastic behavior.
Tough-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120° C. it is very viscous and almost solid at 50° C., while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ's researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority flexible road surface, which is composed of six layers of material, the last of which included asphalt.
Between the uppermost layers lies a layer of wear made of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called supporting layer, which is made of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
The fact that this road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other, important factors to consider, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates into the layer and only escapes again with difficulty. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research works were still awaited, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are even already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of the Miss Colombia.
El Valle will receive his 14th. Mistitles.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty-handed in awarding the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez had to settle for being on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the tape she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. The proclaimed Misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María ConsuelaGiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many are asking themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every screening that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took home the crown of the Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced her the answer to the question "Which book influenced you the most and why?" which had been asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it’s a way of civilizing, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped most for my childhood is ‘The Little Prince,’ a fairly deep book.
I am currently reading `guilt and atonement'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called `passions'.
An answer that met with little counter-love, firstly because of the term `civilize' and secondly, because it had not specifically explained how each book it named had influenced it.
But after the ceremony was concluded, Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all the people: Please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that the fact that she was the preferred one, who received all the applauses and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other contestants jealous, which the Queen stressed, who therefore could not shine on stage."
And this was evident at her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and on her two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she appeared safe with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition, after all, does not become queen after all."
In addition, Valle went out of the way of the press at the end - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie regarding her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
There will already be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to her country's social affairs.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the deriers and the fibrosis, which was noted in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for `natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens' coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was honestly hard to notice for me, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The operations are ok, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay this place."
Because of this prize, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that from today on, Melina is starting her year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent on the appointment of the National Beauty Contest Colombia at one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopeist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last 4. November, a lophoscopist of the Prosecutor's Office (CTI) investigative unit from Cali entered as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopeists in the CTI's department, Eliazar González had on-call duty this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he frequently had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he settled over to Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who had run the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger imprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the examination, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this did not resemble the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, was not wearing glasses and was very much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen right: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González gave at a press conference about the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopes not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identification papers or they have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in the event of a theft, because the thief had leaned on his hand at exactly this point when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
“Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting. But in this case, we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had taken part in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
When the investigation was suspected that a family member could be suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that this is the murderer, it is nevertheless linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloskopist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a planting trowel or ribbon is used to take away.
After that, the imprints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "outraged" are challenging the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded together in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Much of it complied with the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities this Tuesday when, with a judicial order, they again tried to enter Manhattan Square after being cleared off the pitch at dawn and trying to occupy another spot at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded together in front of Zuccotti Square, which they wanted to gain access to with a judicial order that allowed the "outraged" to tent again at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests occurred.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will get together in a different place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray elaborated that the response of the "outraged" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible eviction of the square and authorizing the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "outraged" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of the centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, though Bray can't give accurate numbers. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had gathered at this point, where a secondment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, and at which the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn is to be analyzed.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried photocopies of this judicial order with them and distributed them. They even gave them to some police officers guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had indicated some police had beaten protesters.
The judicial order prohibits authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws that were passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other stuff they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg clarifies in front of the press that the reopening of the square to the public and the protesters had been lifted by this judicial order. The protesters he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square, which was carried out at dawn, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," because "some businesses would have received threats" and local residents were "banging on their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," the movement's spokesman added, who accused the mayor "not respect press freedom."
Occupy Wall Street officials informed that they were considering organizing "great actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to the two months that protests since the 17th. September is already taking time to remember.
Pamela Anderson is on the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will be on the 1. December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," rabbit on "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on the 1. December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" will appear and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today circulated images of the television program, in which Anderson - who also appears for distribution on the internet of a self-shot porn in which she appears along with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to portray Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" show, appears as a baby Jesus.
CTV's Christmas program relies not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had referred to the North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore."
Japan is reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that culminated in a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan was the 2. World War had witnessed.
The government's initial estimates in Tokyo valued property damage at $300 000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three-quarter cases, gross domestic product data from July to September served to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the rate projected to the year.
The figure measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the machine sale for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impetus that are using the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, prompted by the growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has confided in the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency -- is taking refuge in one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing from the eurozone's debt crisis and the murky forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on the export companies' accounts.
With a tougher currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very exhilarating.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states had clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the global economy, brought to light that the brakes would have been drawn in the greatest economic powers.
Because it fell by four-tenths to lot 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which stands at 100, having dropped by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the skyrocketing risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also continuing to get lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being substantiated by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he supports the new austerity measures and by no means his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, the 19. February, will take back.
“The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26. October were hit," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Despite this, Samara's message does not clear up the doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge from the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million that Athens desperately needs. He clarified that he would not approve of a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated because of the impact of the game of poker with Papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that it is not to be shaken up: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties were to sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible."
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika's inspectors would "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what was needed for the payment of the sixth section" of €8000 million, although there is no definitive date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position on this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of micro-financing worldwide."
The Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday recalled that Spain has become the second donor to this means of international cooperation in the world over the last two decades. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in people."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there were "no doubts" that these types of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium targets set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal, the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the "poverty limit."
Spain is also "continuing to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
“We have recorded many successes” and “face many challenges.”
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for the impetus of "two fundamental goals."
The Queen stated that it would be sought that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago," which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. Among all of them, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project earned her yesterday the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "advocate of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez was of the opinion that the microcredits were a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialized countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success," "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opened "their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president due to general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, the 14th. November in Leipzig went without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally provided for in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The Presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes and was initially considered to be Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees, left no doubts on the part of the three finance ministers who were extended to Europe.
The Chancellor's main idea, like the motions, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the eurozone; this could, however, lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote, in order to give Europe a face.
However, this is in any case one of the motions for proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble’s godfather.
Certainly, it is little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however, is set.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country on the ECB’s Executive Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously bring about an increase in Germany’s position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has no longer tried to win its congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in trouble, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe request is dedicating a paragraph to the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This is a reminder that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sick leave?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now embarking on the sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15. Arriving in Bordeaux in November to seek a family allowance fund and to make a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the effort to subject the economy in a hardship test, but on the other hand is no less harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on employee sick leave.
First with budgetary objectives: the government is targeting the introduction of a fourth day of leave before taking into account sick leave among workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the wage of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to provoke anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And which would be accompanied by a different measure of rather symbolic character: to grant the state officials an unremunerated waiting day in the event of illness (so far, there is no waiting period for them, in contrast to the three days of leave in the private sector).
Meanwhile, these questions are under discussion, the majority is also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and beyond that, these will be reimbursed if this is demanded," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, the 13th. November in front of the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of sickness reporting seems a little disproportionate.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have most often borne fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first stay with the national figures.
According to the state health insurance company CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily severance payments were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Healthcare, the daily severance payments in 2008 represented 5% of health expenditure at EUR 11.3 billion.
This amount included 46% in terms of maternity leave, occupational accidents and 54% on sick leave, which is €6.2 billion.
And therefore 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average that covers up certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40. 000 surveyed, French workers stated that they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of sick leave in 2010 was of less duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers therefore no longer tend to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (disease or otherwise justified) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness reports represents a vanishingly small proportion with regard to undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak degree is achieved here.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sick leave that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized, short-term sick leave, that is, in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the case of the systematically controlled sickness reporting cases of more than 45 days duration, among 1.2 million, 11% were counted "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, that is, 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a sick leave.
A digit that represents only a weak extent compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to the UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this question, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss of profit per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraudation at the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to intercept its economy.
This had been announced on Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before the Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to do this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners, as well as a new programme for budget adjustment," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the Euro Summit on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27. Decisions made in October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone would be "at stake," as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to cut the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday given his approval of the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent ahead that his party would not agree to take an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary assembly of his party's New Democracy.
He had agreed with the guidelines of reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, an EU commissioner entrusted with economic and monetary duties and who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and this also beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually engage in talking to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts, who are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice arises, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts quote a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada is on the 10. Placed rank, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture where people are afraid to address the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to analgesic remedies, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of Canadians to die at home, however, ultimately 68.6% of these die in hospital.
From the entire country, the rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths that have occurred in hospital.
In the sensitive question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence whatsoever that such decriminalization would entail abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such transgressions, especially in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
"Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians favor euthanasia
Let us note that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already expressed their support for euthanasia, as they believe that they allow people to alleviate their sufferings at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to the persons who have already practiced accompanied suicide, the respondents are 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintaining or cessating funds in patients, situation presents itself as less clear, according to the report's authors.
Likewise, they suggest in their recommendation list that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the deposition of the funds for which a legally valid rejection has been submitted should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the settling of funds at the end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and this also beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-ending measures already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the panel calls for at least consideration, since these, as well as euthanasia, served to reduce physical pain and to refer to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already made reservations about the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Among other things, RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme", as this does not set any limits to the euthanasia practice in the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation where anyone who is life-weary and older than 18 to ask a different person to help him in his suicide," according to RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's personal responsibility above all other values involved in the social work of society.
But now, he says, there are “guidelines and commitments in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports regarding the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, however, is holding it thanks to Russia’s support and rejects a “plot” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, had taken a position in favor of a resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II Jordan was yesterday the acting Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "resign his office in Syria" in which around forty civilians and members of the government power were already killed.
"If Bashar were keen on his country's interest, he would step down, but beyond that, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts, which had been addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he declared in reference to Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily rougher attitude.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "tightening of consensus against Assad as well as the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the state department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power have died in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two other civilians had died in "shot changes and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless considered that the country was heading towards the end of the crisis.
He, by the way, has reacted forcefully to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his duties, which in his opinion represents a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not give in," he added, under the assertion, "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which is encapsulating itself in his "paranoia" after him.
An unplanned new assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to implement the on 2. November decided to discuss the planned exit of the crisis, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the liberation of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday classified the Arab League's decision as "uncorrect" to beware of any sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet into parliament that is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of parliament, one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, had in turn to wait to say that Mario Monti would put a vote of confidence to parliament until Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be made in that of M. Monti presented presentation of a deletion list culminate, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, remarking that it was "sure that markets will show themselves to be dull and understanding."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister should establish a staff consisting of predominantly technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next general election, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the vote of confidence from parliament by Friday.
M. Since the beginning of his function, Monti has committed himself to work in all urgency in the sense of the goal of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis towards the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government, does not change."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget adjustment in 2013 despite the austerity plans taken up in these last few months, has applied in particular for new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "head of Italy's chief executives, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic surgency," as a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence as well as his independence as an EU commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "different Italy," according to the editorials.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has to pay for €200 billion in state bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear weapon-usable explosives, according to an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Security AIEA and other documents based on this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
The AEA last week said its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for more than three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to start a company in Kiev that manufactures "nano-diamonds."
His company's economic difficulties in 1995 would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before returning to Russia, he participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosives system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only extremely proficient in this technique, but, moreover, as a state member told the Agency, had worked his entire professional career through essential on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
Crimes and offences directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or increased slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there was a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The overall digit of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 to a very weak extent, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a mitigation in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed. The increase in anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time emphasized that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these assaults," he added, assessing that this could be done while improving the police attitude towards the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" presents itself in American federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users in particular to watch the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again resemble that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "name" make it possible to trace the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users, whose messages ("tweets") are tracked and that track your messages.
This allows to find out if they allow to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general internet spread on Monday "in August at a small percentage of users," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, stocked with some esotheric-looking wording (RT for referenced repetition of another person's post). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus avec un maniement plus comparable a vel
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and resembles too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" feature will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budgetary Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Social Democratic/Christian-democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid an eventual degradation on the part of rating agencies in the top creditworthiness of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann highly personal who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian public debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the level of debt of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not fallen from AAA to AA+ in one fell swoop, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria also gives a call for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26. October instead: At that time, the heads of state and government would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to public account balance in the constitution or by enacting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model" since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the federal government’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states, as well as the municipalities, should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate the budget debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authority would intervene again in the currency markets should the yen continue to rise.
"If we establish excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we did last time," M explained. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen, in turn, was up close to the historical levels that Japanese authorities did on 31. forced October to intervene.
That day, Tokyo had sold massively yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of driving a new record level against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen about it on a regular basis, dopeded by purchases from investors who view the yen as a "refugee" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipping below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, since they exchange them for national currency.
“Japan is fighting after the earthquake as well as the tsunami on the 11th. March, which has ravaged the Tohoku region (Northeast) for its reconstruction," M points out. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the yen could already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
The third economic world power has regained traction with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, for the first time this year thanks to the sharp increases in exports and consumption of households "palated" by the disaster.
The prime minister, however, estimates that the yen's inflation does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to invalidate the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", which made it clear that no additional currency easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to pay off the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) amounts of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet skyrocket, exchanges make pullbacks
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European key figures.
Despite the official take-off of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting this Tuesday, the 15. November even a little more in negative realms.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m., falling to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined 0.4%, London down 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions regarding the yields on government bonds in the eurozone in troubled, the global stock markets continue to give out some of their recent gains.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a 0.7% barish.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trading is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its bear to on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European value was worth $1.3570, so it gave up by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, granted a motion that, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain's loan interest rates remain at very disturbing levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian bonds reached 6.85% to 10 years, while that of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investor fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by paralysis by the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed the implementation of the on the occasion of the on 27. October summit of the eurozone decisions made are "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate shear ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of the eurozone's growth figures
Statistically, France posted economic growth driven by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, while the expected 0.3% achieved better.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the basis of the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it's the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that must not be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion, to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, not a huge proportion of the world’s population should have to forgo a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to forgo nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitutionable source of substitute, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to annex another unit to its park after Fukushima by re-commissioning the Three Mile Island plant, which was decommissioned after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence on Russia, which is increased by the increased recourse to import gas, in particular on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; because of this, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are each 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key role in competitiveness and a stability of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay than it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us note that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 jobs induced.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a huge number of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and make them creators of countless jobs.
Should France take the decision to phase out nuclear power, much of these SMEs would fall victim to this, and the annual €6 billion of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, it must be acknowledged that there is no more than a devil's work a miracle cure for the generation of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing plants, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single one, namely in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it proceeded without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented masses that caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident as it had done after the previous two.
As a fruit of this approach and a cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that allows it to be resilience to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, by giving them free rein to take the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is imperative and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party-manoeuvres dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overburdening of police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights," as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the official side had shaped the weekly shows, the interior minister had casually (see Libération of 23. May) proclaims that France "does not need any talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad."
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a wide-reaching consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
From the right was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country," from the left by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990 that France "cannot absorb all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is in the degree of great mobility
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 from both right and left.
Of both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of great movement that is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his program, is limited to banalities that indicate that partnership-based development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron, in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would invalidate growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that these threaten to replace the local workers, especially the less qualified, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the native wage workers, since they mainly practice occupations in sectors that are unutilized in terms of jobs.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do little to attract domestic wage workers, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched to labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also between locals and migrants has a positive effect of the immigrant influx on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by the immigrants, as well as economic growth, is beneficial (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on average about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 contributes a net contribution (income minus expenses) to the public budget on average over his lifetime of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" when he took office.
However, these said teeth, which were intended to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th. Century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece had endured.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the attitude of mind.
Universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and may just as well become an "oppression instrument," as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek true-false referendum would have had a doubly revealing character in this respect: first, that of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand also to those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the Democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organised in dependence on the necessities and in the wrong order.
A free-of-all-extent certificate for the European sole ruler or a leap blindfolded to the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: A great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of the full right, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, it is no longer known where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and this prevails in Europe.
It is all of Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - yet it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the People's sovereignty.
Because it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and initiate a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has a condition on decisions at the European level, which cannot be made without total democratic legality without leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has been fought over for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is pushing for European economic governance today.
Agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisages the citizens - would be renewed folly and another impasse.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
To create the republic in France, it took the fact to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe politically, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become a common good
The world trade fair for chip cards will open its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic stance.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should actually end with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most supportive segment is contactless technology, which enables payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, having long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been spread.
Consumer markets, however, are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically hand over bank cards to their customers in the future, which are stocked with contactless chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A vanishingly small percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
“They are in default.”
“But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year.”
"In 2012, we expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also testified yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows its customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front of each other, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is troubled by the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long-suspicious relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirming.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty" about this.
"The way in which both organizations proceed, as well as the intelligence community's relations, indicate a clear cooperation," he declared without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger, which took place last January, has exposed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped by supporters of the Aqmi in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips in the rubble at the scene, which belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls is leading to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but you undoubtedly have to wait for clearer evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
“It is conceivable.”
"It has been known for years that the sect draws financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In these last months, these "support services" have become increasingly noticeable in their course, as have the speeches and the operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to start with Washington has put pressure on Abuja since that time to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention must be paid.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "the Western education is a disgrace" in Haoussa - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and claims strict adherence to Sharia law, while the activists affiliated to it are campaigning against the godless central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in their sights.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks against the commissioners.
However, the reaction on the part of Abuja is, as usual, indifferentiated.
The army surrounds the city, you count 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the blame of a suicide bombing that occurred at the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since worried all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a talk with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned Boko Harem and was ready to share all the clues.
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq, and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America have a complex world with simple, not to say: lead simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow activists have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and statements about foreign policy, traditional republican focus.
Slogans fall over China, Iran and Israel's aid - frequently in no way substantiated - slogans.
Mitt Romney, who was most popular in the appointment of the Grand Old Party, threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse it of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is most strongly irritated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupidly walked if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off his breath in terms of his emotion-flattering behavior.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's likeness
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran should sanctions to stop the nuclear program fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll get the bomb.”
He also promised increased military aid to Israel and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner over obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful ignorance of the file to the show.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat to be given counter, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, says he will be ready to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The recourse to torture measures against suspected terrorists, which Obama banned by Obama in 2009, was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to give water in his wine in terms of the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not quite so informal.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive record of National Security under Obama, which has eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to the slame.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to bring its leadership position to new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glitz and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound system and at gourmet buffet, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the wheel of the valve that transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you can already sound the eventuality of the construction of a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: for them, it is now becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soovian pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is very sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by advocating this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of an invalidation of European energy, as the project has struck a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have heavy gas consumption and whose gas resources are running out, in barely five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers, who are numerously represented in Lubmin, with regard to the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 m.
During their construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be dodged.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream, said.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long queue of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from it, as the Swedes were not eager to see a Russian state company permanently settled at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas located in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be little likely, since the sweat seams were estimated to be at a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas transmission line.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures one meter in diameter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of locomotion through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the line management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies are E. ON and BASF affiliated (each to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transported amount of gas is," Jens Müller said.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour cost should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are certain to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges on a sandy, pine-forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and further key figures of the incoming gas before it is passed into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per elapsed hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent by candlelight with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored pages, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s specialist consultant at the time, is tasked with launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique, called Mole Skin, which is a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for upholstery.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that is up to 20. Century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, because the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-spirited customers.
The small, Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exists despite the upswing in emails," Maria Sebregondi explained.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour ", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard print cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural zeitgeist and knew how to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success that puts envy on the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the"15. Week of work for the disabled."
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, so points out Éric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt Association, which is hosting the "Week of Work for the Disabled.""
“The progress made within fifteen years is considerable.”
“Back then, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high.”
“Nevertheless, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.”
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled unemployed before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher educational qualifications.
Ultimately, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among disabled people compared to 38% on the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it more difficult to start work again, and that "form the core of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes of mind, which certainly but slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité said the managers surveyed have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people" that was "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually inferiors.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, date from 2008, point to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: the number of "fees of paying" permanent establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies,” Pierre Blanc explained.”
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Even before they stood up to the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens hadn't concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendly match.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well and gladly make peace.
Five months after his attacking player's spirited gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had received nothing but praise regarding his person.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
"I want to look forward," the Liller native assures him.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in the club and the national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
“In Lille I’m all year round, which is not the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to get to the start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
Without, however, refraining from the note of "pleasure."
The French national team he has been cheering since the age of 7, his victorious campaigns he led between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he said.
This inevitably helps to reinforce the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
“We just got into each other’s way.”
“To be able to play against them means great luck!”
Leekens, for his part, made him sound "proudness."
"The pride of playing a galamatch."
"Proud" also to - in his capacity as "neighbors" - to confirm that France "has again become a team at a very high level," and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician will very well see the aircraft share with the Blues (the French national team) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he insisted.
“We’re planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
“You’ll notice that in the upcoming games.” The match against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked objectivity.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of bliss, in fact.
But there's a match to play, and to dump an opponent, and that's Bosnia.
Considering Friday's first-leg match (0-0) in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to impose the important stamp on the matter that would have taken the pressure off it.
“This is a good result, but it puts a certain risk, as we have not scored an away goal.”
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to fight their way through in front of an audience that should be equally hot for the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but are completely convinced that we can gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can already satisfy the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk as we have not scored an away goal," regrets Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have in mind to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians right from the start, so as not to give them time to think.
A good idea, provided that it is put into action this time.
