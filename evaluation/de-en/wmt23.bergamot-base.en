Diego Cocca to become Mexico's new national coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not among the favourites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blooms on" also includes the information about what is blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers of associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015. Objective: In the Geesthacht urban area, flower islands are to be created on a large scale, on which insects find food at all times. "In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthachter Nabu. He has hives on the property himself.
So that the undertaking not only remains an action by conservationists and the specialist service for the environment of the city, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory panels are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so nicely here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant at home.
In the first week of January, the start of the season was already at the Wildhasel
More recently, shrubs such as winter scented cherry and winter snowball are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter scent hedge cherry is a very broad-bushed shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there, among further information on the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants now show flowers. In the first week of January, the start of the season was already at the Wildhasel. It blooms particularly lushly at the topping-out path at the slope, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looked from the sky down to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 15 o'clock for a fast tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd Birthday.
For the native of Munich (15. January 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh" is Monday THE highlight of the week. “Dancing and stepping is my life, without it I can’t imagine.”
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dance legs with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old is recovered in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today you would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. “I spent my life dancing, acting and singing.”
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the round of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: The tap dance was in the 19th Century developed in the US and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is loudly painted tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced the tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they create an audible tone when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome with us".
What is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sports, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analogue grows again for so many
The rapidity with which our everyday life became digital hardly left us time to set rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three possibilities. Either one was among the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you could be one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a phone call with the relatives for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you could go to a phone booth. Unforgotten the smell of the plastic listener and the click of the change coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person when calling - picture telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean was one of the president's advisers.
After just a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure., as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was hostile to pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, because it occupies 63 of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebs
2023 will be celebrated again in Veitshöchheim. The 5. Season is in full swing and the prominence did not allow itself to be asked for long.
State father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which makes his costume suspect. He sees himself more as Bayern's tribal elder. At his side wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's environment and consumer protection minister, Thorsten Glauber, has picked out the children's hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and Ms. Anja.
Completely taken off: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is moving into space.
State Parliament President Ilse Aigner was looking for none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a role model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and wife Birgit.
Bob the builder aka construction minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's gold boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff in carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Economy Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, a district councillor of the district of Regensburg, does the same to him.
The political opposition, of course, was not to be missed either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-chief Ludwig Hartmann as Bavarian lion.
The hiking is the SPD parliamentary leader Lust: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, Manfred Weber, chairman of the EU parliament, was on the road as a pantomime. By his side, Mrs. Andrea.
If it does not work with politics anymore, he can still conjure. Nuremberg's OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
Flott on the road as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small slash against the climate activists played by the Franconian crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Bold eighth in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to join his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on the scene as a TV pundit, is still undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even partly strong fog did not prevent permanent winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay had already been enough for the successful title defense.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the persecution, Bö is once again the clear favorite. Its running shape is outstanding, so that it can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent terrifyingly easily.
Meanwhile, nothing came together at Doll. After the veteran had awarded all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there had only been sixth place, it did not go better three days later. Three rounds of penalties already in the reclining shooting and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with a 0.7-second lead, wafer-thin ahead of Bö. It was one of Doll's only three career successes that was on the podium so far this winter. The Beijing Olympic eighth pulled away wordlessly after his weak performance and did not initially give any interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Brazil counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is mostly about the value of democracy. They both look back at their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden, during a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has insisted on preserving democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. “We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that make up the core of our strength.” With regard to his right-wing predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazil has been isolated for four years".
Left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in late October in a runoff election against Bolsonaro. On the 1. Lula took office in January. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Supporters of Bolsonaro had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital, Brasília, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is gloomy reminiscent of the storming of the U.S. Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of the then President Donald Trump violently entered the House in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much attention to international relations. "His world started and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "I feel familiar," Biden replied - an apparent allusion to his predecessor, Trump.
Brief note on the press - the Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF manhunt posters? They saw on it the members of the Red Army faction, who were released for denunciation and firing.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, the mood was made so publicly, against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let’s say bourgeois democracy, let’s say the late capitalist society. (Here's nothing about the really dangerous in pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is otherwise more behind Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" of Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is ill-informed, because there is in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, but: At number 1 to 5 (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my environment anymore who reads this sheet. If it did, it would be high time. We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing left.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Ms Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is needed anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: "I can confirm that my client has made an application to the competent court for the cancellation of his civil partnership through his family lawyer. I do not comment on details.”
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, and there have been rumours for about a year. After his jungle camp participation, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial centre was established in the ruined village north-west of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned for, among other things, Franco-German youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In homes, everyone knows everyone
LZ-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: In homes, three or four generations often live under one roof. This is where the inhabitants find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles per day also brew long the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some also back right back.
Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing considers further rate hikes in the fight against the high rate of inflation "absolutely" necessary. “The inflationary risks continue to be great. The cost of energy can rise again slightly, and even the opening of China can temporarily give prices a boost," Sewing told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row at the beginning of February and a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16. March in prospect. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. Higher borrowing rates can also lead to deferred investment and thus economic growth is weaker.
For highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy, rising interest rates are also a burden. "The consequences of permanently high inflation are substantially more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. “Of course, we have to keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently.”
The ECB is aiming for price stability for the euro area at a two percent inflation rate in the medium term. This target has been a long way off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which drive inflation significantly, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will collapse "sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). “I currently see this as the greatest danger to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.”
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" on infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). “There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And he will also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas supplies to a certain extent. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany pace". In addition, the Federal Government had recently launched an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
“First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and put a wind turbine in the garden against his will, for example, to the neighbor," said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process, what one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried and failed with the classic rulebook. “We should think again whether the procedure so far was right. Maybe we have exaggerated it with the rulebook and made it too complicated for us.”
However, in view of the many open tasks, for example in the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. “As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it can be.”
Union warns of smashing Bayer Group
The chemical union IG BCE warns after an announced change of boss at Bayer against a break-up of the group. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three mainstays is just right for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, a member of the board of the union and Bayer supervisory board, told the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. “The transformation of industry can only be mastered with a company policy based on risk diversification and sustainability – and not hedge fund activism.”
The background is the change of chief executive at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals group announced on Thursday. Controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post later this summer. In early June, the ex-pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The acquisition of U.S. seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion, completed in 2018, is hanging on to the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weedkiller glyphosate in the house. Bayer shares have been in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It was known for some time that Baumann would not seek an extension of his contract, which was actually to run until 2024. Pressure had been put on long-term strategic investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital were also involved. Bluebell is pushing for a split in the group, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown shareholding in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the Rheinische Post. On the other hand, he does not consider a separation of the far larger agricultural division Crop Science feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets against the planned pension reform.
The unions oppose a government project with the concentrated protest on the street. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
Hundreds of thousands of people are expected in France on Saturday again, who want to demonstrate against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the center government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. A turbulent debate in parliament has been going on for a week on the controversial reform.
Already, many people in France are working longer hours than until the age of 62, if they have not paid long enough for a discount-free pension when they reach the age limit. In many exhausting professions, people could hardly work any longer, say the opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not wear out their health completely in the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay with their contributions for an increasing number of pensioners. In order to keep the pension level stable, the population would have to work a little more. The critics dispute the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But it is not only at retirement age that the government wants to screw. The increase in the necessary payment duration for a full pension, which was already decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about 1200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important plans. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was called off, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Already several presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protest and strikes were all certain.
With Macron's camp no longer having an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains who have announced support. Some of the MPs, however - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a narrow vote at the moment is likely to be the concern of crippling strikes at the moment with Macron. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility so that they went quietly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - plenty of sun in high altitudes
A mighty high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there is a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. “Although this high will shift a little east over the course of the next week. But it still determines the weather in Germany.”
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands for days dreary high fog gray, while in the high altitudes of the low mountains there is pure sun".
Sunday starts foggy-turky in most regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can also rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun is becoming more and more apparent. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or highly fog-like. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine around 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually stronger sun will nibble back on the high fog and can dissolve it more and more in the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high fog blanket. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine are around 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, however, only around 3 degrees. Weak winds from different directions are blowing.
On Tuesday, there may be only tough resolution of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after fog resolution. In high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is shining according to the forecasts. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin argues: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The beaten pot favourite Sofia Goggia has shown herself severely disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't put in the performance I can," the Italian said at ZDF after she threaded at a goal and was knocked out. After all, the 30-year-old was able to prevent a possibly severe fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races of the season in this discipline so far. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving, will have to wait for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. At her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was missing due to injury.
“I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about a hundredth of a second," Goggia said after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel. “I am disappointed. I gave it my all. But that’s life.” Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected by all the experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not".

Zelenskyy and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
A joint conference call agreed to draw up a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport said on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, wrote the British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. “And I have made the position of Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now make a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other senior representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelenskyy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is ultimately soaked with blood and not portable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides military bases to Russian troops for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has unfortunately lost its "honesty."
The occasion of the conference was the announcement of the IOC that athletes from Russia and Belarus want to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, said that it had also confirmed at the deliberations that it was rejecting a start by Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. “There is, in our view, no reason to invite the Russian and Belarusian sport to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to be fully committed to the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's aspiration to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "The sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in the empty space.” Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently said that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violated the prohibition of discrimination.

"Hey, horny butt!", the fool in a skimpy sexy costume whistle after and shout suggestive sayings: All this falls under the term "catcalling" (dt. cat calls). The term hides nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stocks severely decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. The talk is of the "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Defense. "Probably half of the Russian army's main stockpile of tanks" had been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, secretary of state for international security issues at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander made no further details about the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to the U.S. assessment at an online event of the Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has pledged Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, your delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for aircraft, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now vice-chief of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. “It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment – including modern tanks.”
A law has already been in force in Russia since last summer, which allows a greater focus of the economy on the needs of the army. This means that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Vertebrae around post occupation at Heer
The post, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the move.
A call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously unoccupied job, according to the Minister. "Speculations of a free staff representative" she did not want to comment. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. These are cleared out from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ requires Tanner to clarify the "unusual ordering process". The decision is the "appearance of Postenschacher," says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to take back the appointment. The ÖVP "continues to be up to the neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before cost
Thuringia's carnival stronghold of Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs are difficult to cope with, among other things, for safety, even in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the total cost of the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "train of the cheerful people" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades were cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannic Carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold of Marne is sticking to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We're going through our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were even more controlled, reserves would have to be touched - "this is not possible every year". The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to luck in the accident, too much had been ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Security will require twice as much staff as in 2020.
If you are on the side of the road on the Rose Monday train in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much with them. Camels or not, the number of visitors is likely to be large: "I believe that if it should not rain on the day from buckets, then we can certainly expect an increased number of people," says the Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. “This is due to the fact that two years no regular Rose Monday train has taken place. The train can of course be replaced by nothing.”
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally "deficient", which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Burnt Vodka
Ukrainians are not considered drink-proof for nothing. There is local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. Not a Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell much difference in taste. The same is true of the vodka, which is widely used. They burn it here especially in the villages themselves. They call him samargon. How much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had dropped by a fabulous 80 percent in five years. Well, you can also see here how little you can believe the Russians. They say you should be careful with it as a tourist. But that's only true if he goes into mass sale. I guess there'll be panicked.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer for work, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-annealing for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favourites victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at Oberhof's World Cup sprint. Yet there were two glimpses of light in the fog.
As much as the Federal President made an effort, it was not clear from the honorary grandstand on Saturday whether the discs at the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results over my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a chuckle and referred to the fog, which repeatedly pulls into the stadium, which severely affected the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit of the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier had won gold in the first race, the biathlon fascinates me," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for his modernized sports facilities: "The refurbished arena is great and offers great conditions. This is what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded." In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades."
Sportingly, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again shared the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him, his error-free-shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a backlog of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow scored flawlessly and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his failed mixed use on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five slices this time and disappeared as the 55th deeply disappointed and commentarless in the cabin.
Bö had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility. However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the capable; they each landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. In the case of women, on the other hand, the German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. “When you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as a tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotive" to duty. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych displeases 'bee crush' on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on refereeing ball.
Aggressively approaching players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanship. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model.
German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in working together on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviours of the players who surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. “We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will sanction it."
Recently, two coaches had also been given place references. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. “The coaching behavior also falls within the realm of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behaviour has become a bit more demanding or aggressive towards us referees. We also want to punish such unsportsmanship consistently," Brych said.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good coexistence of coaches and impartials. “Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent backlash. Then the person concerned has to live with it. This should not be anything earth-shatting," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
“From the emotionality, conflicts can arise in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee side," Fröhlich said. In recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a rethinking process as a whole would be initiated, that such behavior simply does not belong," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible impacts at another level. “Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, resulting in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently responded to negative behaviours," Fröhlich said. “Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful.”
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race of the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro in front of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves of Estonia.
The German combiners do not compete in the Black Forest in the best line-up. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not in it. They prepare with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, the one from the 21st February to 5. take place in Planica, Slovenia. “We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch at the ZDF.
Seven lightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people have been slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a statement from the police, the rear-end collision had occurred on Saturday, when a motorist bumped into a car during a slight back traffic jam from behind and pushed him on two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
Have launched the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (re.) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
Sunday, 12. February, an unusual exhibition ends in the Marler Skulpturenmuseum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, 12. February, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marler Skulpturenmuseum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the artworks disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marler Museum. He will be on the 12. February presented by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
The finissage is Dr. Friederike Schuler also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous illustrated examples, she presents the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connecting lines to this genre of art in the Federal Republic with a focus on the NRW in the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received his doctorate in 2013 on the wall painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-linked art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the last curator’s tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued an arrest warrant for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants had been issued against 33 people, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating, according to Anadolu, for possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of those investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7 magnitude quake had rocked the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another magnitude 7.6 quake at noon. More than 7500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Penultiment Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow dies
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95, the left-wing faction in the Bundestag said on Saturday. The party thus loses "a significant personality," declared the group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and the former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the district management of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on the 13th. In November 1989, he became the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on 18. In March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his post a month later. He was the last prime minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The leader of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short news service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist." Bartsch added:
“Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose cleverness will be lacking.”
“The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special merit of his. That will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS has always been to represent even that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow has seen the new state "quite critically". German unity had been carried out too quickly, the GDR had perished too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too unilaterally as an "unrighteous state", had criticized Modrow, according to dpa in many interviews.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile strikes. However, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs on Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several heat and hydroelectric power plants had been damaged, the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyy, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power plant, and production was cut at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles from Friday as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received in his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to let the small town of Bachmut down
On the 24. February has been a war for a year. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland just before the anniversary. The danger of Russian missile strikes, however, continued in the night to Saturday. In the capital, Kiev, air alarms were triggered for the fifth time for that day late Friday night. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev area said in a statement. Fighting drones of Iranian construction were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal Government selects consultant for network company
Demands of the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split them, failed on the coalition partner SPD. The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be in the future oriented to the common good. This means that it does not need to generate and transfer profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government accompany this process. The refurbishment backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently operating very untimely. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this maladministration with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She would have slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse had not come down even when she set in. "Such a race," and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe that with words," she said. 11,000 spectators josted to the roaring Schlager music with Germany flags, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon," that's what she had set out to
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Cup as the biggest, if not only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick has been the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently ranks fifth. And even if the performance density among the women in the top is significantly higher than in the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, you had rather others on the note for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At the time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of forging a plot to overthrow along with the U.S. government.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry calls for more orders from special funds
First armament projects have therefore already been cancelled, further projects threaten the same, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this time," said a response of the German government to a request from the Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment amount is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans themselves. If these rise, there is less money available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive on the motorway at the motorway exit Kupferzell to the left in the direction of Heilbronn. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, the police announced. During the turn of the BMW driver, a collision occurred between the two vehicles.
Both accident participants indicated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered property damage of a total of about 20,000 euros.
Stuttgarters commemorate victims of earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is occupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated and prayed for the victims on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's prayer in a serious and silent manner. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful treatment with each other. The municipality also asked for assistance and strength to "bring our assistance to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands alongside the people in Turkey and Syria. The spokespersons expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The supplications were also translated into German on Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already come together at the fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association of the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind in the Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat inlay - Ebersberg
"After eating you shall rest or take a thousand steps." The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Because if you do not sit in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow, now use the lunch break either after the fast snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk to the fresh air. At least you could gain this impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 14 o’clock not only dog owners can be found.
One reason, of course, could also be that the human of modern times can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Because why not learn news from the settlement on the occasion of a short march through nature from the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet the girlfriend, with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? In this way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with tax consultant, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? Unless there are foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done well is the acquisition of naturals. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to cheese on a table on the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. Only stupid if you have not already considered the purchase in advance and made appropriate precautions. Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer empty-handed and regrets in their voice. “It’s a shame, unfortunately, we forgot the money.”
The disappointment can be felt, because you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replied: "That's not true! You have a bag with you!” He points to the hood of the jacket, which has been quickly thrown over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an extra headgear unnecessary. “My wife always packs everything in there!”
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat inlay and on this midday short trip not only by a lamb's back, but also by a very practical idea has become richer. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and came out of previously unexplained cause in a left turn to the right of the roadway, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guide post, bounced sideways against a tree and stopped a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. Firefighters freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency service took the seriously injured man to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of inability to drive, the taking of a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, total damage to the Audi amounted to 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the United States
The Treasury must instruct the tax authority IRS to issue the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, said the decision Ministry on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the U.S., real estate entrepreneur Trump had made his tax return public neither as a candidate nor later as president. He resisted a release until the Supreme Court. A prosecutor in New York has received the documents in the meantime, but no details were allowed to become public - unless it came to a trial.
The release to Congress is arguably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of accessers is slightly larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, the Parliament is always pushing the confidential to the outside.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president," Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Between Birth and Death, Life Plays
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? What mobile phone contract for the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - right?

February, at 20.30 at the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British serious criminal arrested after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from the UK has been arrested in Thailand. As the British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled the start of a court process in early 2018 in which he had been sentenced to eleven years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros) in absentia.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statement, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. Whether this fits well in the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism here, is to be seen. His sense of humour fits very well with Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert’s recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian in 2019 for a year. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowness actually is and what it can and above all not. Of course, Corona also occurs, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many are pushing ahead with: What's really important? All this with a huge wink, unexcited and very ironic. And so not only are they well entertained, but can also learn something.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the fighting from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are carried out in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley plain are rock pyramids and rock cuboids, which provide the player with provisional protection, as these cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended gameplay, are increasingly difficult to hit. In addition, UFO's are published at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by a UFO hit. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game initiation process, the game-Fix on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test run. The latter operating mode represents a special sequence fUr of the check of the control elements and the computer function.
4. Game sequence
The gameplay is triggered when the START pressure switch is actuated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the play noise becomes audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles can be determined by the player by paying attention to the displayed text at the upper left notice display angle of his cockpit. One note may be, for example: OPPONENTS FROM RIGHT. In addition, a point that represents the enemy position is visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, OPPONENTS in the FIRE AREA are displayed in the upper left notice display at the same time.
At times, UFO's become visible on the screen flying over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that can observe the fighting and neither eliminate the opponent nor the player tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by the radar. The UFOs are supposed to round off the fighting and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the opponent tank. A shooting by the player brings this 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the display the opportunity to use a game sequence 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the play sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the figure.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of the maximum results, he or she may enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, the Battaging of the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage, the table with the maximum results is deleted. When deleted (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are received with their initials and written back on the screen to challenge more players. Each score that exceeds 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player’s initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enroll strokes. After that, the device changes back into the attraction game. CONSTRUCTION ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, which made this structural unit more stable and ensures proper functioning of the switch contacts. A further modification is the centering bellows made of rubber, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever into the central position. The microscarf ter are now, for easier replacement, attached with self-locking nuts. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y play circuit was extended to two (2) interconnected circuits. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technique k, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and calm image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply, given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin socket. Furthermore, the device has a console that is intended for smaller players as a platform to facilitate play. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation space.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do a certain review to round off the quality control. In order to ensure that the device was delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Device not yet connected to the 220 V network. A. Examine the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wire harness connectors for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose plugs to each other.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide so that a correct connection is established. A plug connection twisted 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm fit. (3) Observe the manufacturing number of the device on the nameplate on the device back. Check that the stamped production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor. An image about the location of the production number can be found on the back of the cover sheet of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your specialist dealer for more service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a view through the player's sight glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-coated encircled opening of the fairing. If the opening is not precisely centered, the covering fastened to the housing with an adhesive tape must be released and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector on the power supply 1 (s. Fig. 3) is consistent with the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the issues related to current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. With the help of the DirectX diagnostic program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. Please follow these steps to access the DirectX diagnostics program: Click the “Start” button and select the “Run” option. In the text box, type "dxdiag". Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound card. You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound are working properly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
Other programs may take control of the system resources the game requires to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many are automatically started when the system is started up. Such programs, which are constantly active on their system, are also called “background applications”. In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you stop such background applications before you start the game. - If your system is running antivirus or Crash Guard programs, you should close or disable them before you start the game. To do this, locate the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option (“Deactivate” “Close” or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also stop general background applications, as these sometimes lead to problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section “How to stop all unnecessary background applications”. Cleaning up the system
Before you install software, make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit of “cleaning up” your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to make everything run flawlessly. Then there is a great chance that current games will run on your PC largely without any problems. A “clean” system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus run other applications that you otherwise use, faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to use the ScanDisk tools or Error checking, defragmentation and disk cleanup. Using the Windows Help
1. Click the “Start” button and select the “Help” option (or “Help and Support”) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. B. “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), “Error Check” (Win 2000/XP), “Defragmentation” and “Data carrier cleanup”. You will then receive a guide that will explain how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. Thus, one can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

1. Press and hold the Ctrl and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DELETED. Now the Windows Task Manager is displayed. 2. To exit a background application, go to the Applications tab, click the appropriate entry in the task list, and then click the End Task button. Before you call the hotline
If you want to call, you should sit down at your PC and have the following information (see section “Checking the System Configuration”). Please also prepare noteboard. - PC brand and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (RAM) - Information about graphics and sound card and drivers
INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me as a new means of expression, with the help of which you could push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I came to myself like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th. Century before: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything still had to be discovered - in particular a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games took advantage of only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too much out of “action” and forgot about it a fundamental element of the human world of experience: the sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that conveys sensations. Although this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit’s greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting in dark corridors against abhorrent monsters and shooting on boxes to get ammunition, but has far more sophisticated and profound content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer a game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical of video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help to change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we have repeatedly been forced to question many of the principles previously deemed incontrovertible. I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass by without a trace. David Cage

We ask you to carefully observe the instructions of this manual in order to ensure satisfactory function of the machine.
The information and illustrations contained in this SERVICE MANUAL correspond to the status of the printing time. RESERVE CHANGES IN THE SENSE OF TECHNICAL PROGRESS, BUT NO RETROFITTING OBLIGATION! Please note when setting up
Transport damage
If external transport damage is recognizable, these must be immediately objected to, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, Federal Railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Mains voltage
The device is set for the mains voltage indicated on the nameplate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to the VDE regulation, the device is provided with protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Impeccable work of the coin system requires horizontal and vertical installation of the device. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor at some time, please turn off the machine briefly (drew power plugs) and back on. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Pull power plugs before repair! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-bearing parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still cause dangerous voltage. ATTENTION, HIGH VOLTAGE! There are about 20000 volts at the anode connection of the picture tube. Replace backups only with those with the same values! A blown-out fuse signals overloading of a component. If the backup is replaced by a higher-value one, serious damage can be done. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Game sequence
By pressing the appropriate start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum loan 2) for 2 players. It must be tried to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the moving SPARX. The game is set so that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX will be released. When alerted, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your territory, your mark will fall into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross or return your own way. If you hesitate and do not complete your surface, an ignition cord will be plugged in and your marking mark will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow character speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches can be reached.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controllers work properly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be performed on the volume controller on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
Generally. For programming and testing, the 4 switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. With this ad, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work is chosen. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Einsatz-Programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, a "maximum of loans" that may be available before the start of the game can be discontinued. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. The factory or factory can be used by multiple pressure on the "sub-test" switch. Default setting is reached when the bottom line (RESET line) is green, press "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High Strike Rate until now." This value determines the number of scores/hits required by a player to enter their own initials (names) and hit points on the screen. The "maximum of credit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is locked - if coin lock is present. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set so tightly to 99, so that by throwing in a coin, the loans cannot become zero if over 99 is added. A free spin mode can be selected by setting "highest number credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of markings per credit
"Threshold": Amount of the % number to be reached to switch to the next pass
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": difficulty of the gameplay
"Attract tone": at "0" no sound at stand operation
in the case of "1" clay also in the case of stand operation (animated) "table model": at "0" stand-up device
at "1" tabletop unit
The loans per coin are set on the "slot programming" display. High score program display (highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the 10 next scores. The values are used to set to high scores selected on the previous ad (setting "back"). Pressing the "Up" switch sets the QIX Standard initials. With pressure on the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation." By pressing the "Up" switch can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts all over again. The total number can only appear at 0 if the battery or plug connection W1 is removed, when the device is switched off. Left-sided coins: number of coins thrown in the left-hand coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: number of coins thrown in the right-hand coin slot. Loans paid: number of credit given for shredded (revalued coins). Loans granted: number of loans given by the device. % Free Spins: Loans granted (paid + loans granted per 100) Minutes played: number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, extended or won. % Leisure: Minutes/played minutes per 100. Average playing time in sec: Minutes/paid + loans granted
High score: Numbers where a player had enough high strike rates to displace other players from the highscore list. By actuating the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a default coin setting can be selected by the display or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches, while the top number is green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single pressure, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to its desired values and only changes the values that are not appropriate. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "sub-test" switch. If the press is not intentional, the default setting will appear. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or reduce the values. The process is finished by pressing the "Test" switch. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin thrown in through an associated slot. Coin units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus loan is issued. “Min. coin” is a value that accumulates loans until a fixed minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (Memory) FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, is out of the question. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This condition is likely to indicate failure or fault of the battery.

beginning of the test method. Print the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The checks and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to begin in the Auto-Test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. If the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the plug J 19 is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = from / I = one / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM's with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device with the above. Display holds, an error was discovered. If the communications RAM's fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or error in the data board. To locate the error, remove data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: error in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device with the above Display holds, there is a mistake. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the circuits or decoding connected thereto.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers follow are checked for accuracy when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, related multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to hold and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, detect the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it will indicate that the next check is started (data hardware). The connection to the data processor must be there and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The second for the right jacket to arrive without any discernible seam defects. BUT I was probably too much looking forward to this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented me on the basis of the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she should sit so tight and I did not want to fight my way into an S or M at my bus.... In the end, she would have fit in length and hip... in the rest I could swim. In addition, the feed material already came to meet you when you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It will be returned :/
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered her for our daughter, she's totally excited. She usually wears the 158 and she fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly be worn the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I have chosen the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition does not quite fit. But what my mistake is. Then slightly changed something to make it fit. The pad looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use them or the whole area. It worked without any problems. It's nothing more slipping. Would I buy right away.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product in itself I'm okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is far too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months and he could not use it for the sake of size. Now at 12 months old we've been looking for him out again and he can use him. Has nothing to bite with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down very much.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately declines
I have probably been blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I want to send ahead that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large (to store the equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things you take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need replacement. On Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can not say that. But that he can keep up (as written in many reviews) with the well-known products, which are sold at far higher prices. Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping it would be, but there really can be no talk of that. The padded walls are considerably thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more slabber. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly high-quality. Therefore, I decided for myself that the backpack would go back. If I buy an equipment of many thousands of EURs, then I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack in my hand. Quality seems to have its price here. For someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's also not that the decision was hard for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will find your things much faster than with a grey inner life. For someone who has other demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, the electric series of E has had me. L. Todd likes best, but my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommended and was really looking forward to the third part. In the part all the time it's about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily dragged on. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to himself and is then like a little child in every fight and warps?! At the same time, there were also disagreements, of my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand on him and try to convince the ex that Taylor could not without him and he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that was the last part of the row and thought that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more tension back to history.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do so! First of all, the movie isn’t soo bad now, as many write. Sure, of course, the story is totally constructed, and always conceived according to the same scheme F. When you see the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn to do so! And that’s exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times have I thought about the film (and that even though I know that it is only a movie, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, often the tears shoot you in the eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already really properly made. It's just a pity that people just don't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying the animal and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves to do so. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living things :Misreporting. 4 stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always on the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some people expect a movie à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is above all "French" - in addition, it is quiet, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and expect nothing from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week. It should be noted that only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given in the smaller packaging size, at the larger full 5 ? That's very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint into a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I noticed that it stinks terrible! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a roughly chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even with unsatisfied result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first attempt. What was the worst, it still smelled weeks after application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't disappear.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and even a longer additional disease. I wanted to help my immune system not only through a healthy diet, but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 on the jumps. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely Recommended.
Function not quite flawless!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with "connecting" with the mobile phone over time. This means that it is no longer charged even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new deficiency. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the mobile phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches from the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many gross defects, I find that a case with battery should work perfectly, especially in its function and therefore I am, for the cost of 30 €, very disappointed about the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good review comes about. Ultimately, it is actually a spectacle cleaning cloth, which you get a gift from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better. I have promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very thin. Since I have used it I can no longer exchange it I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far more than 2 Euro you should not give.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I already fell into the shower), gives bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... You have to water suction cup, of course, you have to water, otherwise it dissolves.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this is causing a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just well audible. My old speaker did not play bass as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in the volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to pull off a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
On a few places the color was fragmented and if you only went over it with the hand, the color went off to some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn’t want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense . they would only replace the damaged parts but as if both were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon has done all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are supplied which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope consisting of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman stuffed the product downright into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not complain about it, as I urgently needed this product. The supplied adhesive barely holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not get hard. Just one day after the gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The templates are partially incompletely punched out. For the one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and resort to a high-quality product.
I'm not unhappy. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closures + beautiful appearance + stable when it is constructed + shelf board can be positioned as desired
- Doors pop through magnets (you can maybe balance with rubber studs) - some unclean spots
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no other and did not have a trophy in the house, with handicraft glue glue glue glue glue) - the holders for the shelf wobble a bit (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it would not look so good and had such good measurements, I would give less stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. In addition, I find him a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me....but
There are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). I would have awarded 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (packed individually s.Foto) also means a star print for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and will soon collect full scores.
Get on my alarm clock
The alarm came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so light that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned face to the alarm because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time comes and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. The colors and also the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also found it good that he has a battery so that the clock and the wake-up time do not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, processing insufficient
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a version - instead, a board laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "6 pay - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this accommodatingly and quickly, but I only found out after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two star deductions. The light itself is great. The rooms are now illuminated very brightly and evenly. The light color goes rather towards cold white. For hall, study, workroom, laundry room etc perfect. For living spaces, I would personally resort to warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is a help, I am pleased to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I've been thinking for a long time whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them ** The soft silicone scratches expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They do not pass on the heat either and can be touched directly with it. **The dishwasher, however, sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after swiping and they're gone. Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-Goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping simply lace. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, tap unpacked and all parts tested. We found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we have had to detect significant scratches and abrasions. The fittings/connectors of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chromed tap itself. This part has probably been delivered and sent back again. We keep this tap and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again do we order such goods via Amazon but prefer to spend a little more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. Just find it sad that customers are so screwed!!!
Product per se top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very happy with this product. The installation was very easy to place, and also the radio range is very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, here plausible values are still displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably there, because completely astronomical values of the outside humidity are always displayed. This is a great pity because the device was installed on the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at the delivery stand today still drives cheerfully with Hermes through the Republic without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service of Amazon was excellent as always with the trigger of a replacement delivery. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The motor is strong and results in a beautiful cut. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, a big shortcoming is the catch basket. On the one hand, it is only at the top and bottom of hard plastic and in between made of fabric. If you drop it off completely only briefly, then of course it is compressed and parts of the content fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator points to red even at half-full catch basket. That would not be so bad if the mower would not lose large parts of the cut material from then on. Always emptying the basket with a large lawn when it is half full, can now not be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned and returned the device as best I can. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, which becomes unusable for me due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket.
Good equipment for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly constructed. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fumiliously. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing a battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened nevertheless, the hotbed is still too high and in the front right the screw falls out, because it is not tightened at all although the hotbed is still too low. The poles that hold the car are straight and the table is also. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because it is impossible to print anything. To the construction: The construction was quite easy you could only show how to lay the cables because you have to re-lay them several times, which is very effortful. I have already contacted support but still did not get an answer after a week of waiting. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. I expected a little more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
Unfortunately, after many years, my old caser has given up the ghost, so a new one had to come. This one makes a very robust impression and is equally precise after several test measurements. There are two batteries, so you can get started directly. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full scores for it and believe he lasts at least as long as the old caliper. From with there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, durable smell
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being, because it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it has been constantly "ventilated". After returning it is no longer possible, I dumped it. Rate from purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so that it looks quite massive. The larger ball is freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the chain is very simple overall, so I have already torn open the closure twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that will not go well for long. But for the cheap price you can simply not expect anything really high quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple buckle actually lasts! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't go up, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, making it even softer and more snug. Only: who has something magnetic on the arm: The buckle is made of steel!
Unfortunately, scrap! I was disappointed after the unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I felt that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now for the function: Connect only after some gimmick.... you do not follow the instructions at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and have re-inserted, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it did not last long, because already after an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, not to use it for me! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase, only bring trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I have had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the internal shaft was rusted after 3.5 years. I only bought them again for one reason, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft at the previous pump had a production fault and the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the vents broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled cardboard box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping power.
Could have thought through better. Since I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than walking around with a huge keychain all the time. At first, everything went pretty well. However, then the paint went off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this is also possible with a cent coin, but also with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now to get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. Beautiful is that you are by the different parts, the screw on different sizes or. Lengths can be set, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need a pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys to itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. Ultimately, the screw in the thread broken off for me during the third time and thus the complete thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but with the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. In advance, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment, I can’t really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can be put directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since two smaller bags/bags were still included in the round cosmetic bag. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention this anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a tasting price and that is ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, he didn't. Battery? Exchanged. But he still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money right into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should approach the brush very carefully so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables. Battery life is very long enough. Definitely perfectly sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after a long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is well portable for a variety of occasions. Price-performance is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (yes was recommended). I would have just wished that the neckline would not be so deep, and also the sleeves could tolerate a little more fabric (if you do not have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a fancy dress for many occasions.
Fingers off. It can't get any worse. I really and seriously didn't expect a scrap to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually goes, Blu-rays are recognized to be maximally unreliable. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes Rödel sounds like you have not heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it will no longer be anything or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press a pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or even anything. This immediately leads to an unresolvable freeze. In addition, there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar additional for a fee, the price of this drive will double.
Do what it's supposed to, it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually eye-swiping, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and thus relatively useless. I didn’t know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a snubby extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this unshaped lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgment, the extension fulfills its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick does not just dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. So not a real bad purchase, but my euphoria is within narrow limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I had to send back unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous loading is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation :P It was a small adapter where you can attach to the tablet. This is said to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, this does not fit with the adapter. Well, too, keeps so safe and has contact therefore... All in all a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and in an aluminum piece stable. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. It's been going on for months without problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but brings a lot of performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and therefore always on the road at level 2. Has also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competitor products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without restriction.
Great product with weak battery
We have the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode the location to felt 0.5m accurate. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump once by a few meters, which is not disturbing. Would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. He currently lasts about 1.5h days. Here would be a solution great which would create 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery does not have to hold out with us and we find daily change also impractical. You should not deal with the dog with his collar :-) . The app worked perfectly too.
After a few weeks of rubbish
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can not be used any further. With the last couple, it was also in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lessons it will be enough. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I ordered new ones with joy. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. Comfortable, they are just like the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the retaining strap on the heel sits quite loose and will probably not last five years like my previous one. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I would like to go to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck. Included included the mattress and a car air pump. To the mattress: I laid them out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope this one doesn't show up again. In the pumped-up state, a reclining test was carried out directly. It is easy to lie on it and fits great to the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event it is the pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We previously took out the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is put into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (somewhat at the soldering point). Since my friend is gifted, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in zero comma Nix. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I’m looking forward to the hardness test at the festival. I hope she doesn't lose any air and will last a long time. Likewise, that he doesn't reappear mold. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have any other experience, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely worth no more than $10... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. for the idea of toys. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the lappish processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21. Doors were no more doors and I had to allow more or less my son that he may accordingly also take out the remaining parts because they almost already liked him. The parts often come out of each other, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to bring the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the front windscreen. This is also very difficult to put back on.) In itself, I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend anyone. Manufacturers may reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and do better. :\
A real drone
I'm excited about the drone. My 7 year old daughter is flying with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually completely sufficient. The hair jamms in it and the drone breaks very quickly I did not expect at the price, but falls from the ceiling on the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem. For questions nice contact.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. Did not see that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is an insolence. Since then, the computer is constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life
I was really looking forward to the clock. Design and appearance great, messages etc were easily displayed. Service worked well... and yet I send it back. The big hook: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, only on the cupboard overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of news during the day, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore for,me not usable. It's a shame.
Noble cover with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely buy a case. I recently liked covers in which you can also insert the credit card. This provides the shell here. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather cover makes a robust impression and seems to be well crafted. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only on the connections are recesses. Otherwise, you can operate on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible on some QI chargers to be able to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even the QI charging station made of leather by TORRO is not possible. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be loaded when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well processed !
high-quality cover with armoured glass foil
Robust case with a proper armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily raised. The material is pleasant in the hand and does not soil. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some hold. It's not too bulky and is firmly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
