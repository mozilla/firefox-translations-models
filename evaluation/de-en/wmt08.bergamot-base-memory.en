Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, according to the EU's Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are down just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate. According to their discretion, the rate cut would favour rising commodity prices and the slight drop in unemployment the emergence of a spiral of inflation.
The ECB is eager to keep inflation below two per cent, or at least narrowly at the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a quandary: inflation must be "denied" in order to exclude later action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve-year record high; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in food and energy prices is responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone.
MATIF wheat quotes rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in cooking oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly US$100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by early December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while approval for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among party-loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) face a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry hurdle: They come in the total population to two percent.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, overall economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" have been so high (41 per cent), while another 46 per cent consider it to be "pretty bad."
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about changing their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth assumes an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the prime minister's work to be "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of proponents for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of those who think that you could get to grips with the dissatisfaction with the prime minister even without a change of government.
After the unrest last October, 35% had still spoken out in favour of the government and the head of government, but today this share amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20% would "likely" cast their vote.
By comparison, if the general election were to be held this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty," another 15% consider their participation "likely." Given these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Transferred to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty", the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area have also this year maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelstrieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galloped away" last December, the price increase has not been drastic, compared to the already high, earlier initial level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid for last year well below $1,000, this year is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets surveyed.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread soils for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop to below 200 forints in the product.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan scored the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have found that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forints, but the VAT increase in the prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
Exactly this process has hit the trade badly: apparently, the department stores could not quite decide which price range they should apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unforeseeable.
(If the merchant is poorly planning the circulation speed of a product, it may fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" shopping cart last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 around 1720 forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket around 1,630.00 forint cost more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase showed, the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a more than 30 percent increase in the period of 12 months.
So in addition to flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase on the multinationals.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from all, durable food goes in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning, there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals, which were due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of the infections, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The bacterium, resistant to antibiotics, was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured man of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a short time later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
To 10. December of this year, 1094 infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections triggered by multidrug-resistant pathogens were certainly registered in the hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in their nose without it causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if the agents are metered too high or improperly applied, the well-responsive bacteria produce antibiotic-resistants, which spread rapidly in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital everyday life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, so Timbor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," according to Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples too rare
The majority of the infections triggered by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the origin or the spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should examine the admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA-infected.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced as frequently.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the state health insurance company.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the agent can form, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among the outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Savings are made on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted by nursing staff from one patient to the other.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds narrowly lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately in the financially less well-off hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost favor the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are adhered to, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control is causing huge costs for health insurance companies, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After initial signs, the programme is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death-steering police chief was not drunk
In the case of the police chief of the XXII. District caused car accident with fatal outcome is now the official report.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII. District that killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the press secretary for the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office, said on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The former police chief turned his own car in the XXII. District into Kossuth Lajos street, driving over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebars, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the crosswalk, is secondary.)
The pedestrian has succumbed to his injuries after his admission to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebars suffered a shock, then put back its functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor's office has launched its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another 400 million EUR for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements totalling 400 million EUR in Budapest on Friday. The money is to flow into education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million EUR framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented by grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement for 100 million has already been signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the falling in love 200 million EUR.
The sum of 150 million EUR agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of 300 million euros for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining 150 million euros will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of 50 million euros, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe looks closely at the Balkan state, which was rarely mentioned in the past.
What, where, and who buys on the still cheapest market of the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis by the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after patch for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extremely favorable area of Russe, for example, also records more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trading and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and thus attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already shopping on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties around 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are very important, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is making up business people who are investing with the goal of a medium to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 percent annually.
The price increase in property prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali roadmap, which defines the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
A fierce debate is currently underway between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signalled that it does not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subordinate to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member council, probably at the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit."
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's effort to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "after 2012 agreement" is successfully achieved or not. The Union would even be prepared to commit to a 30 percent reduction, provided that other major industrialized countries in the world, or Developing countries are also prepared to fulfil their obligations to the best of their ability and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed to a minus of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will certainly meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The deployment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which the IPCC, the UN’s international Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee, also highlighted in its latest report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
Initially, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of Taliban-led operations to the net since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage, shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets, is controlled at the airbase in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are put on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" being viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeepers (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of the foreign missions.
Propaganda published in this way is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertisements, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, since they confirm the justification of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also make it to the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are only talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the theatres of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genus" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-scare simulation.
Christmas party with raffle and pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she is holding a work conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and Pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas spirit with raffle or toasts into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
Christmas fever has already gripped offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry will be held this year in the defense department, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are making the marks.
The 4.32 million forint-cost Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint-expensive Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Center (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of a Christmas party on 7. December held the Lucia Ball there.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was announced: There was no ball gown or suit on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for a puritanical celebration.
The Ministry of Health is hosting the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference for the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and Pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will simply toast with his colleagues in the ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own ballroom, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forints per capita - around this money there is a buffet reception followed by a kick-off.
Since the beginning of the term of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate every year in this way.
However, there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on 20. January to a New Year's reception, the ministry's Christmas party is dropping out this time.
One asks the one hundred guests to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Stadtpark ("Városliget"); according to the information of the department, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short address from the minister and end with restrained cheating.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas party, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is organized in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Unions and the Hungarian Union Federation are forming their coordination committee on Friday for the strike of indefinite duration, which begins on Monday.
A large-scale protest meeting will be held on Saturday, with a work stoppage on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law.
Strike-related, significant traffic obstructions are expected, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) also strike until 13 o'clock.
Details of Monday's strike will be jointly announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Unions and the Union Federation.
It will also establish a LEAGUE - MOSZ strike committee responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A protest-greater assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, all organisations that have joined the strike will put down work for an indefinite period of time, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law, was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only come to a vote on the health insurance law in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will have to face significant traffic obstructions: the railway workers will put down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will stand still.
At the same time, there will be highway closures of a direction in many places.
The call for strikes has been followed by numerous unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others are planning a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, an agreement on sufficient services could not yet be reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Union of the railway workers VDSZSZ, although especially around the Christmas holidays more and more people are on the train.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike from the start of operation until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will stop work for four hours, and the teachers’ union, respectively, the Democratic Teachers’ Union will have 2- and 2, respectively. 2-8 hour strikes called.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide alternately at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and puts forward a new conception for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible professional groups will be given access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport, which provides the sidelines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard raises state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The institute's "risk warning report" states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also thinks that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to trust in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organizations calling themselves "national self-defense association" have been founded.
"These groups have in common that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly brag about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, order protection), citing the unfitness of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: All this is done according to the method that seeks to disguise various political aspirations based on the political and party disenchantment of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association thus do not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration with the court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-increasing factor for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, so many ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighboring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has implications for the region's political stability" - it said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central East Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the foundation of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a neighborhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion for the creation of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
In their opinion, a veritable "gypsy terror" was felt in Bulgaria in the past 17 years, but the state remained idle and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have kicked off a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they are establishing their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats with the organization of their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-changing tendencies be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk alert report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, public holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of rescheduling the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
In the EU and in America, too, one understands otherwise by "holiday."
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and days off work.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year, for example: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are days off work - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve releasers can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th. March, reminiscent of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd. October, the commemoration of the 1956 revolution.
On 20. August will be the founding of the state, on 1. May the work celebrated, on 1 and 2. We remember our dead in November.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day postponement" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, should ultimately be processed, has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public servants and civil servants alike.
Excluded are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
This year, the work regulations are only confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From the 24th. December the life in this country remains formally, since most for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve take time compensation, or the specially lifted holiday.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so there will be fewer reschedulings during the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around Labor Day so that people can stay home for four days at a time.
Saturday, the 26th April will be a working day so that Friday, 2. May can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling hangs with the holiday on 23. October together: On Saturday, the 18th. October will be Friday, 24. October must be processed in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely marked by the holidays, after from the 24. December everything is lying and standing still, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six chilling trifles to annoy work colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we can no longer notice: They bring "color" into everyday life in the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or do you better face the challenge and try to avoid them misleadingly, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it, perhaps by calling the marketing department and confessing remorsefully, you would have forgotten to align the message (that's the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can really make your colleagues uncomfortable moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something borrowed that doesn't belong to you?
There is hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it is not there.
Yesterday, the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-its in your pocket from the office, because it could hit you yourself: no one left if you need it urgently.
Gossip about colleagues' private lives?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what made?
Where and why?
One should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, instead of the people not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call the office to report sick, citing an agonizing headache, because you are uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, indefensible executions, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by the colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play badly to your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Sum, Giggling, Phone Calls
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggoe of the colleagues?
Unintentionally listening to a phone conversation that you better not hear?
You should not annoy the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), trample, constant scolding or nagging.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not finished on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, if you do not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes, and apologize if others were affected by it!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or to make up for what has been missed, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Track pants and slippers: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even if you would actually allow your workplace to be so casual!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to such an extent that you dress in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how do you become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the all-morning traffic jam.
From the radio, a strange melody resounds: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that resounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage skirt with its guitar cosuppling is "in" again, which proves domestic electropop: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, played even in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a tavern cannot tolerate two pipers - began to tread its own path.
However, he only made the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, when he had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, named the almost only trendsetter, also in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy," but no one was interested in whether they also like to wear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The now released new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the recently broadcasting from early to late pop music mr2 Petőfi has successively set the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All right so (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't exactly mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for the sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motif.
The listener’s willingness to record also works according to this principle, independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many people hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
We never composed for the market.
In our case, the music does not arise in order to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but these in turn only exist in the intangible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go our way, not to mention that you always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as a team player who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
Initially, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us come from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be a draught horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to put together the choir of gifted soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - that's how Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - were born, which we then christened "Underground Divas" later.
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something."
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the tune the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically straight away and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it also required the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, sing together and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the stage in the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they stood in the back was like that because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where is going, we simply allow these certain wings to lift us up the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks in the mixing.
For example, on "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or on "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove did not want to work for a long time, but gradually everything has joined together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I have "let go" of the album.
Currently it's "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same."
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Bottomless scammer
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel is the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came because of it by almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
In contrast to all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's more mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as can be seen from Kerviel’s statements, which the French media published, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros just on the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those of low-income customers or those who had already had pay-off problems before, would be put in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and was right.
By the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I had earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain that," admits Kerviel, and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that he would not be found.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even if the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Did he fear to be exposed?
Probably hardly.
"I thought that she satisfied the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant to a real estate agent and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Still, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Even in my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officers.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of Allianz, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball," he told the policemen.
But the bosses reportedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
“As long as I made money, you closed my eyes.”
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him on the sneak?
He was suspected of vacationing.
"I only took four days from last year.
A realtor who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can come to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to be allocated about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" program.
The most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" program is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative ventures.
The companies are to win finance for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous acquisition of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan court upholds twenty-year sentence for ex-president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud totaling 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) will get this Central American state behind bars again is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the appeals court, it will now depend on the prison officers whether Alemán is to leave his sentence at home, or whether he has to go to prison.
A court dismissed four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign firms in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has drafted, and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The one for the current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented it, and the ČSSD could therefore not allow itself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly approved this traditionally little-noticed, yet highly significant law.
This is, in a sense, paradoxical.
All governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covertly by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
State budgets suffered from three weak points among the past Social Democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of spending that is mandatory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also social spending, which the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit-ridden fiscal policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, levies and bank loans, opened up further sources of investment, often uttered unthinking bonds, through which they indebted their town halls in excess.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off this debt by mass selling shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years, which the ČSSD boasts without ceasing.
That represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for their governments to put the public finances in order.
Instead, these governments were in debt to the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributed to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, no wet social programs are necessary, which have unfortunately been inflated quite superfluously to a gigantic extent, especially in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in cancelling some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and, no matter who is in power, will remain for him as pure management.
It is only slightly exaggerated when you say that then ruling politicians become civil servants who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns envisaged for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last decade, which was only possible.
If we do not want it really to become a purely administrative official from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take taxes and fees in the way of calm in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to manage crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will reach the currency markets by means of auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates, at which they are willing to borrow money from each other.
For example, the American Fed is sending 40 billion dollars to auction, another 24 it is loosening for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time after the 9/11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to defend or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend," wrote in a report for its clients Bernard Baumohl of consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The central bank's coordinated action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost around 60 billion dollars because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions in losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what else can come up when it decided to take this approach," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after they failed to do so. lowering LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in money lending between banks.
That means the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though central banks in the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further cut in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks contributes to heating up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is reportedly hurting developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN’s end-of-life international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet," he explained that the ecologists' debates were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies them and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a word fireworks display that's just substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president emphasized at the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him, and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude unabated.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, able to understand and assess technical treatises, had experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the main message of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and thus pose no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptablely complex.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian stems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly declared that he was not against "sensible environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who have no regard for the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already discussed the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving licence
600000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that the authorities manage to issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year's hundreds of thousands of drivers will take to the roads without valid driving authorization.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have exchanged their driver's license.
While small places report a sharp drop in interest in the leader's certificate exchange, the capital's offices are showered with applications, and interest in the exchange still grew this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers every day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
In Prague have approx. 140000 motorists not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to request the issuance with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the prescribed exchange by the end of the year and drive off without a valid driver's license are threatened with a fine from January.
The evildoer pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use an admonition during the transgression.
In the event of a transgression, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the one who does not drive can also be imposed by the municipality.
He could, it was said, a penalty of even 30000 crowns threatened.
The Ministry already called on the offices to exercise clemency and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one threatens a thousand-crown penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, namely a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should hand in their driver's license.
It is enough to take him to the responsible municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers will also have to gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 shall end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made common cause with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years imprisonment respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, but he is initially faced with the first-instance verdict.
At other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to anything more.
A district court in January found 19 people mainly guilty of involvement in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today heard the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the prosecution from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych, handed over information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to avoid prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the spoils.
The charge is about crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for presumption of office and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser rifle scope and a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns by their robberies.
In addition to 20 men in this case, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others for further robberies as legally guilty.
More men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, further cases have not yet reached the court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for the purpose of prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the main hearing.
Children swapped - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns of compensation plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree at all with the proposal of Veleba.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's trial.
"But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had drawn up.
We will determine whether it has any significance at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, an expert opinion was used as the basis for compensation negotiations, which the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying strength and depth.
The men better endured the stress situation, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the after-effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola swapped on 9. December last year Nurses of the maternity hospital in Třebíč.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district governor of the Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian Height) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is subordinate to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by law covered by liability insurance.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for help from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded those affected comparatively low amounts of damages, the amounts were determined by tables and were in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom of Walachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" brand.
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the designation "Wallach king", but the project had built a team led by Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr Harabiš and his team wanting to share in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian at the words "Wallach Kingdom".
Harabiš is also of the same opinion.
“We have a nearly ten year of work behind us.
raising money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to gain parasitic work," he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that was not related at the time with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of spending Wallach passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Wallach Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports, even offering discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the broadcast "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the Harabiš project was and his team, which were devoted to him intensively.
The cooperation of the parties, which are now divided, lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the deposition "King Boleslavs I elected until Saint-Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership role was then claimed at the suggestion of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
The Harabiš prepared competition for the throne and half a princess could provide clarity in the dispute.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal any details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal parade in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: advantages are dwindling
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain, for example, about the too low headroom in the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior for a short time, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have objections only because of the meager central tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and over are the days when we might complain about too short seats or headrests.
The lateral support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as the space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the cargo area.
I have to call it very easy to load and space-saving (also because of the fold-down rear window).
The cavities are equipped with holding straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains significantly more than 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when inviting a stroller.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the cargo space, which is quite flat after the rear seats have been folded over, or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with displacement 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kW.
And frankly, this is what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, which drives a family hatchback.
He is quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
When I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems like his exhaust is clogging with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
However, we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still goes on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car strikes once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper triggering, electric windows at the back and and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So only the decision remains, which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
At British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, which raises fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where the clashes between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Quarrels, harassment and scuffles among pupils have transferred to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has already developed to such an extent that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended himself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and pelted him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak student described to The Times newspaper another awkward incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks are registered who came here looking for work.
About 30000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be fulfilled if you only choose the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in an abundant amount.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20. century.
One of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, built it, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, across the wide boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional, cocktails are available as you wish.
And the cult cars of the Fifties drive around Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, may have been heavily run down, nowhere can you find so many wonderful colonial sights in the vicinity as just here.
Other places are being cleaned out right now, for example Trinidad.
With regard to the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, it was given the green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only new hotels have been built in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane of remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most significant places are not missed by the majority of Cuban visitors.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It should only be mentioned that in the already mentioned estate Hemingways there is a museum, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which also weathered rocky areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the pretty beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there that would have connected the area to the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This insulation helped ensure that it went unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
Some people in eastern Cuba describe this small town as the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is barely touched by human intervention.
Thanks to the unspoilt nature there, UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage register.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you show the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains can be seen, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion, to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draft a concrete plan for the next few years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan does not follow their ideas, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO units to more activity, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow residents to start a further development of the economy and security themselves," British defence secretary Des Browne tells the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of violent actions has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have deployed about 40000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and about the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said similarly today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute in recent months over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Because of passivity, Germany, for example, was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan nothingness unmasked: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will soar to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to get into debt this year with 159.2 billion cones.
In early December, however, thanks to the better development of state budget policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The Czech Republic's sovereign debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on the national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech is responsible for a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the entire past year, the state was in debt by more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should range between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: "We could be overrun by one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it should become apparent that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, that could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he noted.
Debts are growing
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by Treasury notes, state bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kronor this year.
The state's foreign debt, meanwhile, rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September, falling by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt rose 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly in the case of bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of the national debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount stems mainly from the state budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is a maximum budgeted fund for the consolidation agency in the amount of 13.3 billion kronor, a ten billion reserve to pay the pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and instalments for the bonds at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a teddy bear a name, she was presented to a dish in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan with insulting Islam, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserves to be flogged.
After parents of pupils complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was picked up at his home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, according to headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not carry a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, declared that he knew her well, and that she would never have done anything to come toch a religious belief, “I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name.”
An opinion that numerous students share with the teacher, who describe them as “very attentive to their students” and as “person who never speaks about religion in the class.”
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given in the UK, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence for the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties could not come to any agreement on the status," explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on ensuring that peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
"No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time," he added, suggesting that there are quite significant tensions.
End of mediations on 10. December
The mediators of the troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet one last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% inhabited by Albanian speakers, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko by the 10th. Submit your report to the UN Security Council in December.
The talks between Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final negotiating meeting since the troika received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation contract to take place on 10. December will end.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on a continuation of negotiations beyond that end date.
"Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution," Botsane-Kharchenko said.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo under the administration of the UN, Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
"Regrettably, no agreement could be reached," the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these "negotiations of the last chance" have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade to autonomy "belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations."
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise was always to be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade thinks that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made solely solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto power.
Kosovo’s Parliament will have the final say
“Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists were told by Fatmir Sejdiu that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would proceed in coordination with Western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He went on to say that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace agreement" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “the terrorist infrastructures” and Israel must cease its colonization work, Bush explained, recalling the two parties’ commitments to the “roadmap” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term encompasses the three serious problems around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians revolve mainly: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were driven out of their homeland in the current state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the coming negotiations be conducted "comprehensively and thoroughly" and provide a settlement for all points, including enumerating Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the coming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted “directly and without interruption” and that he would make an effort to ensure that they could be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his Vision of two states, a Palestinian one and an Israeli one that coexists side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories that had been occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper, financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigation by the National disciplinary authority of the police (IGPN), a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
"He had no mission, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light," a spokesman for the police explains.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without approval, not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, approached “at very high speed”.
“It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its right from the right,” a police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (dented fender, splintered windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the sharpness of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to people in danger," in coordination with the main government for public safety of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the responsibility of the police officers from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this small motorcycle has approached their left side relatively quickly."
Yesterday, a kind of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked into each other until the policemen managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the rounds, according to which the policemen would have left the scene of the accident very quickly, and this without providing assistance to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out this matter with regard to "any serious error."
According to a police source, “this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are necessary, and in which one must proceed very carefully.”
Libération has met an eyewitness of those few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
“We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw "a completely disturbed policeman who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around what happened and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
According to this witness statement, the rescue workers arrived "about twenty minutes after the policemen left".
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
“I will not let it be claimed that the police forces did not provide assistance to the young people.
They gave these young people first aid.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her," the prosecutor insisted.
In Pakistan, tension is rising
On Monday, Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency had been declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonized against the measures taken in the context of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades that the police there used.
They threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's legal profession have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposition activists, advocates of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (north-east).
The lawyers' movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "called on the population to send flowers and those who took an oath before Musharraf to the judges who opposed the state of emergency.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure, which was announced Saturday night.
He had to go to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 in the days that followed. Take a stand in October.
The chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions," the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give up the command of the army and become a civilian president "no longer" since the call of a state of emergency, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to have his military uniform by 15. November would be handed over, date on which his first term as president ends.
The deputy secretary for information has also confirmed that January's elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a whereabouts by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or spiral, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which finds that the percentage of female pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better “control of fertility.”
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned nowadays.
With one in five couples even calculated for the month accurately, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar panel essential to continuing the scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem surfaced on Wednesday, when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to take on European and Japanese scientific labs.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the crew's second task was to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar panels already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew set about the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, the span of which is 76 meters.
And in the process, it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a pinched cable over a length of about one meter
The restructuring was halted so as not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check, and then repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the 30-meter-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to “operate” the “injured” solar collector.
After closely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and attached some kind of rails to the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second Spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey racket, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had devised and "crafted" on board the station.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today, expected to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the A400M arrears, the stock EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21,96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its 2007 business forecasts for the residues caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further detail.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, EADS’s business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, largely due to the cost associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting in counting the polls: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very sealed election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing a message broadcast on the public channels to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for whom an overwhelming victory is announcing itself.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything see through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,” he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they have lost themselves.
She denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, according to his lawyer, continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much-more questions are raising:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The term of office yesterday announced the date of the first ballot of the presidential election, the 2. March 2008; the candidates have until 23. December time to make himself known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will select government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power so far will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes back even further: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, Putin has again followed the model of a paternalist state, which was completely adopted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “free will give up on the personal responsibility” they briefly demonstrated after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why think long?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional chairmen) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 90s.
The general public prefers stability.
In that sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “Why think long?
Those in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A heavy souvenir
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen over a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless with a "humanitarian" intention, i.e. individually and name-related, i.e. at the query of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states commissioned with their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Delicate information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct investigations, "especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers," explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the intellectual disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of inmates of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or accused of forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
“You can’t expect anything fundamentally new in these documents,” Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, making up 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers had given the European Commission the go-ahead last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission's figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will enormously advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and “services worth 10 billion euros” annually, this week Daniéle Smadja, chairwoman of the European Commission’s secondment in New Delhi, had declared, and regretted that mutual trade “has not yet exhausted its potential.” The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso will be present.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern about credit terms, and announced a tender of tens of billions of pounds with a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual term.
In order to mitigate fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to make a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which will be held at 6. December begins to offer, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, she states in a message.
The bank goes on to explain that this way on the 6. December at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) to be circulated, at the property tax rate and only up to 10. January.
That's seemingly the first time the BoE has put liquidities into circulation for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is "reading itself to take further measures to obtain the "interest rates" of the interbankable loans with its basic interest rate, which differ from day to day.
The intersecting-bench interest rate, which differs from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled to 6.6%, slightly higher since the 18th. September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees, which the banks had prevented from taking advantage of them.
According to some rumours, amplified by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favorable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC decline to review the PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was created in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), gave about ten measures, which had been adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which amounted to 50% to the employment allowance, to reintroduce the TIPP floutante, to a transport cheque or to limit the rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered occasion to partly fierce exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the legislative proposal for the correction of finance, which was examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 said in a statement.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably be from 8-10. August on a 500 acre private farm approx. 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, the license concessions and the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says his company and that of Melvin Benn work side by side in parallel to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working eagerly with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, Charlie Jones says.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival back to life at Grand Park Chicago after it profiled itself in the world of the festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events have 9.8 million euros each in 2007 and 11.8 million. $ in gross tax accounts can achieve.
These two festivals take place in urban areas.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to simultaneously give the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is located approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with joy," Charlie Jones says.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large," roughly according to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent out to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," Charlie Jones says.
His partners from C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one less than the Terminator opposes it.
These attempts are among the delegate duties.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governator"?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the local cinema is currently a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, though that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had on the 30. Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago a successful performance.
He will be featured at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be on the 30. Starz Denver Film Festival unveiled in November.
This month, Quebec also released four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Disunity among experts due to U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the annual financial statements on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the coming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that “purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market usually goes hand in hand with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially when serious tensions determine the current market
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that “the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. Due to the lack of safe equity funds, these invest mainly in pension funds, which is severely affected by the upgrading trend towards high-yielding assets.
According to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, “especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of the rise in the rate of inflation.”
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
"The chances are not very good," the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex already has since its highest mark on 8. November of 15,945.7 points lost a value of 4%.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy from the pension fund made each year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that this year things could develop a little differently; mainly due to the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the assessments of the market situation so far are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
In selecting the values designed to push the Ibex to new maximums, analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that it is the big values this year.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, “as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the appropriate time.”
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the rises will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
“ACS has been on a catching up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumer behaviour during the Christmas period, periodic consumption will determine market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only had declining price declines in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final-year rally so far.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 caught up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive year (the Ibex has been up 8.36% since January) and will also have a final year rally, it will become clear.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the economically strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular is the first banking group to take the plunge to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays until 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations with the unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for it on a weekday in the afternoon, although not for the customers.
Whether more banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is also the intention that Popular pursues with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the buoyant customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not a matter of new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but is accompanied by an increased recruitment of staff, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for this, which seems to have been a clever decision.
Popular currently leads approx. 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally come to the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco is doubling its stock market value for the first time, thus overtaking its rival Antena 3.
“We did it.”
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock market. The broadcaster he directed had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: “This is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses,” he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they “did not sunk too low.”
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches the 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the principal share of capital (52%), and Vocento only holding 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half at 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, at Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is “two similar companies,” according to Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually operate in terms of the stock market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level, seems uncertain.
Telecinco announced a week ago its plan to become the first TV channel this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The analysts see the main factor for the better stock market history of Telecinco in the high payout ratio, which the company could have up to now: In 2006, the company, headed by Alejandro Echevarría, initiated a 100 percent dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after buying 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as the parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
“We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decline from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: does Telecinco (buy) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) as a result of the “multiple incentives” and the prospering market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends that expectations in both cases be set back in view of the “similar threats” (saturated market and poorer economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which will be held at 1. November came into effect.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the congressional decision in the Senate on the additional/amendment requests for the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate deputies, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of setting up the best possible regulation, which ensures the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market event.
In addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, MIFID, which is redefining the Investment Services Regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, increasing the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to provide financial advice to both specialised companies and natural or legal entities and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting firms that join forces with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it is expanding the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic actors.
The law requires investment companies to identify the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks in the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently envisaged further changes, with the decision that the titled bond must now be considered a “complex” financial fund for the investor due to its high level of risk to the investor has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (U.S. mortgage crisis)
It also used the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the workspaces of qualified economists; 30 years after the regulation was adopted in 1977, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate set new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, which works on foreign account, does not need authorization on the part of the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and attract customers at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator, which serves Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union, provides the average price trend that took place in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek a location and quality comparison to US products by announcing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same procedure as the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator determined prematurely was only a guideline, and therefore with the final result, the one on the coming 14. December will be announced, not to agree.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes, the rise of the CPI in November is a “temporary development”; at the same time, he assured that the price index would continue to be at a “relatively high” level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that “even if the current number is not good,” Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were “less surprises” in November than in the previous month, during which the government did not expect such a high increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros with Northern Rock over the next three years
Northern Rock's inventories have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September of last year due to the crisis, and they are now only 12,000 million. Pounds (equivalent to 16,800 million Euros).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to a record-breaking 25,000 million. Pounds, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months as a result of the loss of confidence in customers and, even despite the government's one hundred percent guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which the group would continue to operate after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand name, must contribute approximately a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of the investments of the next three years, to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to make 50,000 million. Pound (equivalent to approx. 70 million Euro) to flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named the Virgin Group this week, which still has three other companies involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested on alleged suspicion of participating in urban corruption
Spanish police have arrested the current mayor of the town of Murcia, part of the municipality of Totano (Partido Popular), this morning on the basis of urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Partido and chairman of the Totana municipal council at the time, last May, and could be the original mastermind of the plot, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Department of Urban Planning and will not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales's lawyer, the prime suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week, was accused.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the "popular" and consequently privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents, which are to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the supposed order payments of Morale to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract, in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will top the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of Congress President.
So José Blanco, organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it in the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is “important in politics to be able to count on the best” and Bono is “in the best.”
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the politician from the Mancha would "all appear to be running for the party" as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as congressional president. He had on the last 15. November announces that he will no longer run in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead campaign for climate protection in the university area.
The former minister had to admit that the president of the government had continuously pushed for his return to political events since his resignation two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party, as with the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and described this as an "act of transparency."
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a “house of respect and not of insult or shouting” in order to make it seem more and more similar to the citizens.
“Regrettably, from time to time, one gains the impression that the only place where you can’t talk calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government was interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and "his good work" and indicated that he did not want to give the appearance of having already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this an "arrogance".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate puts both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate in the foreground in this regard a remorseless criticism, the movement must show a strong cohesion as a whole.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of the President of the Government Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a “new treaty with the planet”.
However, this proposal puts it in need of explanation regarding action, or Non-action by his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain being at the forefront of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol within the EU.
Who are those responsible for not meeting the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which proposed the Treaty with the Planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present without further ado to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages against climate change.
Which companies will be affected, which behavior of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what economic consequences result from it.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice themselves and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, it has and will not be such explanations in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be used in real terms against climate change are unpopular.
They are cost-rich, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero from a sole scientist point of view that he was forced to take back the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothingness, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician, who is otherwise suitable for election campaigns, does not have to speak, or indict, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or if we can only refresh ourselves with one fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-owned village of Totana, the "popular" politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody on the alleged suspicion of urban development violations, it was said today from investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is located until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the manhunts already made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it emerged that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped building land for urban development projects under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be redesigned. This was to build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration sent it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales is also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the group Nuaria, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of Nuaria and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Authority against Urban Offences, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil Central Unit, whose representatives carried out eleven further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the locality belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of space in Totana, which had to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price name other name with corresponding competencies.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, incidentally, is at the head of the PISA study), which comments on the note published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; coincidentally on that day, the issue of which contained the criticism of the book of Blackburn.
“The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding Jokela’s school.
Responsible for the gruesome murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and proposed to remove Plato’s teaching from the lower-level curricula for philosophy in high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of the law, which would be punishable by six months imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you squirt a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of imprisonment of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, the authorization of which has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague was right, someone raised his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles titled: “Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.”
So the feelings caused by the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn-based brain research center Life&Brain, “the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.”
The researchers were able to see that the brain activities were always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and therefore also got the same content; but if one of them received twice, there was also stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure that it actually requires so much scientific effort to get to such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching relentlessly for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is in the public prosecutor's office of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main people in charge of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be at large.
Their names are on the list, which the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as the template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, in Spain not yet); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, traces the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track down the escaped criminals and put the respective governments under pressure so that they put their
Which insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible claim caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is stipulated in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding severance payment amount in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance company composed by several factors, including Age, gender, time of preparation of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments are also due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, these tend to fewer accidents like single people.
The benefit given to the vehicle impairs the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must consider a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that most closely meets his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance company in order to be able to make not only a performance-oriented but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-25s encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-priced insurance company, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it were best for an ideal insurance cover to take out full comprehensive insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full comprehensive case with a deductible, so that the services of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer has to pay a part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the less the amount to be paid," explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europa, an online insurance agency.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accidental damage, but not against the damage to the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, it is up to your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic tariff at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depend on society and its income.
If the company has a high-yielding year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments," explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for a full comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
“Normally, the young people can’t benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving,” explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the “fear of the beginner” has been abandoned.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person also allows it.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full comprehensive insurance with excess (with an amount around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that a high credit has been received, an extended insurance is recommended, which only starts for the third year of the vehicle.
“They drive more relaxed overall and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution payment,” notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full comprehensive insurance with a deductible (with an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damage, but also because it entails high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow are hoping for the point for the eighth final in Milan
Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack next Tuesday in San Siro to achieve their respective goals before the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still need another to make sure that FC Shakhtar does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of play, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will fight for the first time in the semi-finals for the final, which takes place at the 16th.
So this group will be completed before all the others and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-round expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home of the Celtic Glasgow know that they would be group first in the event of a victory and would thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be a defeat in a slouch of the FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because with nine points tie, the Ukrainians are entitled to the participation; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to spoil the Scots for the evening. Those, in turn, hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, having been defeated in the preceding season in exactly the same round by a goal from Kaka in post-game time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw at the first leg.
While FC Shakhtar awaits the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and their membership of UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite his lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place by a victory and thus play for UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the go-ahead in front of 20,000 spectators in front of the eyes of 20,000 spectators for their first tour after the band's dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunified band was "outstanding"
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, in which a video on the history of the band, which had caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold armbands on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fan crowds in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the days preceding.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star “has not seen our wardrobe once, and that’s why I’m very excited to see what he’s going to think about the performance.”
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 “due to internal disagreements” entailed the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
“I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought, why not, so I'm glad to have made that decision," Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that prompted her nine years ago.
The singer also announced that “the disputes have been eliminated and everyone is now very happy again.”
Still, many things have changed since the Spice Girls' last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, according to the report of the TV channel CTV, the group arrived in a special aircraft of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will next perform in California, in San José (on December 4th) and in Los Angeles (the 5th and 7th December).
In Madrid, they will take the stage on December 23.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is simmering between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are routed through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is being watched very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during talks," Ukraine's economy minister, Anatoli Kinakh, told Reuters news agency.
"Changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically drove up prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish State Health Service must improve checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said. outside
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also raised concerns that the Scottish State Health Service has no precise expectations regarding the number of its foreign staff.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly at a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the suspected car bombing in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks in advance of the employment of foreign staff to ensure that they possess the skills, experience and authorizations required to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the principal auditor now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, these have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines before employment with a high measure, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health service workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of the employment of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests by the NHS Scotland are performing well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom have doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been predominantly adhered to.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidance on checks before the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidance on check-ups in the run-up to employment by all staff - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including for best film.
Prizes were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, the director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was named best lead actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety award for bringing British film to the world public.
The prizes were handed over in a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for just 3 million British pounds.
Still, he has earned two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far most well-known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as best director and best director debut.
Rock music was the center of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer got the award for best documentary.
The award for best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
2008 arrested in Saudi Arabia over a terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their affiliation with cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as clergy and security forces.
The world's largest petroleum exporter's state television said one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest petroleum processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an interior ministerial statement, says 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell run by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees, according to the report, planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergy to do more to stop Saudis seeking Iraq to team up with Al Qaeda militias seeking to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hard-liners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergy in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by appeals by Osama bin Laden, Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very large effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also affected a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are burned as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the Earth
Venus may have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on an orbit show that the planet is even more like an Earth-averse twin than was previously aware.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower pace of rotation, Venus embarked on a very different development course.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has examined the planet for a year, provide a sobering look at how Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows you to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
'Enriched uranium' seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material is being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Even so, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube where ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send to the candidate.
None of the questions, the one on Wednesday night, the 28th. November, were raised, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party that breaks up into next year's election.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who helped support the debate that selected YouTube clips to be shown to the budding candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of debate, which was dedicated to a single issue for the longest time, immigration was the focus.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Romney, who has pushed himself forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was endimental about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two set themselves apart particularly fiercely as questioners asked whether any of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the two men have serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they slapped the immigration tampers earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates broadly share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance of illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world, help Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani taking the stand that although the Bible was his preferred book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations in first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to see if Jesus would endorse her, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his applause storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two are shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the start and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party's pain
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this one is not particularly slippery.
No nobility titles seem sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the revelation that a rich businessman has veiled donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this one is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the prime minister had evaded the demand for an election, stupidly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced that decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-dreaded Brown of Stalin has to Mr. Bean developed.
Northern Rock's awkward rescue, an ailing bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have put business associations against the government.
The tax official loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative swams.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's secretary general (and their former vicarious director) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably sets off for the resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they find it impossible to govern.
People do not like to trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to become leaking; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if the one was not directly involved in Blair's mishaps - as with the long "money for nobility" investigation into political party funding - voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's location isn't quite as bad as it looks
The failings are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's of course Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not entitled to the decision.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
Yet so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the work.
He has quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted that resolve by grasping for a well-known instrument, an investigative committee on the issue - to make the measure full, of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be drawn from it" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, like finding something a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has been unfilled for six months, and moving forward with a slandering reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour's hard-liners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a distinct lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unimpeachable righteousness and solid competence.
Card Sharks
Is the credit crisis infecting America's credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is ailing, the predators have the country's credit card market in their sights.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the contagion risk of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the withdrawals and the late payment rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC last month announced that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollar fee collection out of its American consumer finances, in part because of the weakness of credit card borrowers.
It is still too early to panic.
Losses and deficiencies are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was nearly a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. private bankruptcy laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large portion of the credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would rise again, whether or not general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
The industry is also reporting solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will take out credit card debt, now that home equity loans are drying up.
However, the card issuers look at the flow of money instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the properties are less value than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debts among the repayment priorities become more important.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier terms by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are considerably more real.
If lower home prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former principal financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven counts of fraud using telecommunications equipment for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich himself at the expense of her employer.
The proceedings had been scheduled for January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK over the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against her in 2002 alerted Fastow to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers -- called the "NatWest Three" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations that helped tear the company into the bankruptcy vortex.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a stake in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow mistakenly represented to Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others foregone about 12.3 million dollars, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and a month at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the loose because of a 1 million dollar bail, which required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the court case.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer obscure the billion-dollar debt or make weakening ventures seem profitable.
The collapse exterminated thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles related to the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became null and void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of flaunted consumption hosted at a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly money-coming Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its heyday.
"We passed through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in droves, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian flyovers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible generous money spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together is worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they move through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I was looking for the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a Red Carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic jams for several hours to visit a drafty warehouse that, shamelessly, placed Cadillac Escalades, pocket knife made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a trade fair booth of Dutch porcelain maker Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt picture made of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climper-climbers."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trading show.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, crowded through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with pinched gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a firm that equipped the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A., said. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, he would have sold three car radiator grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the interconnected chain bracelets, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a four-was replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more of those than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company had set up four red telephone booths based on the British model, which were crammed with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed out 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaires fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the piles of money, cellphone photos as they sit back in the midst of the substitute wealth, snapping by friends, or just to pocket a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Botched operation suspected in New Jersey death
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance stopped at the white Cape Cod two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the medical cover's box truck approaching," Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon who police did not identify, and who worked in the home on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help clear up a mysterious death that has sent a mourning through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the Police Director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankov, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unapproved surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3am in the afternoon in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have shared little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates lead to the rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets through further interest rate cuts were reinforced by appeasing comments from the vice-chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's chairman, said that policy had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continued pressure on financial markets.
Reassuring wrethening markets in a clear effort, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said recent turmoil had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October."
Should the increased turmoil persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were picked up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit terms with new capital injections into the U.S. markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the U.S. economy now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-invested S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of UK defaults.
Germany's index Dax rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Commercial Banks was awarded a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital funds into the money markets in London rose when credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" rates for borrowing between UK banks rising at 6.59 per cent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since the 21st. November.
England face decision on statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on appeal, is at least under this particular title, here to help help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness instead of ability.
It's not just in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may perhaps also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good degrees who know the business well should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances have that, too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances in order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better than last season, for example, when James was Anderson, who will apparently play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind is stinging into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-notch wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in that tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it makes little difference after all.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant Test cricket player and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that after another discussion in the wake of today's net session at Asgiriya Stadium, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-notch hundreds and just six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and an excellent record against turned bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in the May against West Indies in the Test in Lord, his home arena as a player from middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a shovel-like joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from that was brought to the point when he recently overturned a four-wheel-drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was get out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from afar, and with enthusiasm to say, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better fielder, he bowls his mid-pace with some effect here on the pitches, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I'm tending to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not be doing well after all, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped the city will return to normalcy.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing a lot of doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime is not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive Al Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he called on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they started one of the anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. increase in troops and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who were armed and defend their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about being forced home by visa problems and sealing funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, voiced general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were well visited until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government no longer urged the Iraqis to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I walked away."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up sectarian tensions again and there will be conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an education field does the Saarlanders push the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I got yesterday to the 50. Once a non-Saarlander declares that we are not French" - this slogan the smallest state self-deprecatingly posters to its 50. Birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
For example, the universities cooperate closely with the neighboring countries out of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can still complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But also the state children bring the Saarland in above-average numbers to the universities - many of them without a degree at the high school.
"In Saarland, you use the vocational education and training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their eligibility to study at a vocational school, making the Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also comparatively strong.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual study programs is the second best in Germany.
However, despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at the general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
So that the children start learning earlier, the last daycare year is free of charge - a model that other federal states now also copy.
Whether the performance of the students improves sustainably, will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk pupils shrank from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bayern are expecting better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills at Pisa are not measured - in this area one could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez is converting the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On the 9. In December, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez becomes a joke character.
According to a new law, the clocks will be set to the world time minus four and a half hours, according to a new law.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US-hostile Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair, the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia announced.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with a constitutional reform that citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to strip Chávez of the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also on everyone's lips in Spain.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the constant interim calls of the left-wing populist at the recent Ibero-America summit and had crossed his mouth.
Germans face 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economy, German workers are expected to suffer a real loss of wages this year.
Experts cited a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect less in the salary account in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault is the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases in food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
New burdens could also be faced on workers when it comes to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was indeed right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the price explosion in food and petroleum products pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall prices rose 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere of the Earth, Venus is more similar than previously thought: The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortex at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the evidence - it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning bolts on Venus shoot at an altitude of around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles reports in the science magazine "Nature."
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning has caused life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s there was no probe specifically for the exploration of this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research, which is now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underlines the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially thought," the Esa announces.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud swirl at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows in the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, will be orbiting the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much slower around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans but was lost on Venus into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the German president stressed, but took Merkel from the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not refrained from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, lamented the "shop window policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was intense irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only uninvited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from SPIEGEL also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in an official capacity, Wen Jiabao affirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots as in France.
Everything must be done so that social discontent in Germany does not discharge itself into violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that we do not build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, this already shows initial successes."
However, it is too early for all-clear.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, such as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in heavy street battles with police in previous nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
Faced with the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is "above average."
Above all, more training places need to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families takes place".
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned: "But still we have to be careful."
“We need to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and education.”
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The relevant authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the day before, a line-up of around 1000 security forces has provided peace of mind.
The police will crack down as long as it is necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the aftermath, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots ignited in a traffic accident that killed two teenagers on Sunday.
According to initial findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the death of the youths.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's performance, which is far from reality, documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content - and that nothing can be expected of it itself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was rusty and low in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she was focusing too much on foreign policy with a very overbearing sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and only showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she has recognizably documented for all how much their accusation is true.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling to feel for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a detached politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the approximate even there.
Example of climate protection: It praises itself unchecked for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodesty would have failed the CDU leader two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is arriving at the people.
In doing so, she is damaging her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking the world up nicely.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses left for it.
It is important how often she expects when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
She stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department Attack
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard exchange of blows - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unloaded on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one, for his part, counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani counters, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of privately employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
The self-shot 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via Youtube are little more than keyword providers.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, gets the Levites vigorously read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated, as torture.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq war and torture debates is shown by the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause is blazed in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains contritely, making a request in front of the base and television audience for still being among the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is swerving when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian for first time
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency, which Musharraf on 3. November had imposed.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus meeting another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with him of weighed-in lawyers after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had all the appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6. October rejected.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The arranged sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the blossom-white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music.
That does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
While one may reveal here: Targeted inquiries revealed that although the name was buzzing through collective pop memory, it was by no means so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should not the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is called misleading Krautrock was always more true in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Prize for life's work in 2003, one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the astonishment knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreign is one thing.
Memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also unfolded a far lesser power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th. Century, they lived as city-fugitive communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to fight as a nanny.
Rather in pointed artist existence.
Supposedly, a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name were found in the bulky waste.
Some of this was recorded by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as calm and humble as the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The collection of rice was not solely for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-member record backdrop, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother came the desire to push Harmonia and occasionally practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing Krautrock as its own German contribution to lively music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is here, the Brit, altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Moth.
With which the entire range of influences of Krautrock would be outlined on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's phrase floats with the most strange sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you own the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlor.
The legend formation is used for projections of further black and white photos of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are back into improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to elicit unheard-of tones from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical tinkerers.
The choir of the house does not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, coughing and whispering is carried out under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (powerhouse) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who shouts "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not getting rid of it even now.
Even the most obvious is thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or bring you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" two films are again dealing with the Balkan war.
But both are not convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and ballers or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, of all places, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties last, because too many nice and inconsequential roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove you the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter becomes a hunted" (Why do film titles today actually always have to be as long and confused as locomotive driver collective bargaining agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek depiction: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long had his very best times, but who, as a ruinous monument to his decline, has still preserved considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party," along with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden," which also kicks off this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Mörderischer Frieden" you can make a short trial: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, whereupon one promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not portrayed here as the sole root of all evil, the television-flat film is lost all too quickly in baller and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" explores why there has never been a really good Balkan war film before.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian chief war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personalunion Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are striking: Both times small teams go into the woods to do something that the military can't do and both times it's going to be a journey crazy.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also deny him a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain if, within the last five minutes in the time-lapse procedure, the reporters succeed in what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to achieve in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to righteous revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinemaologics.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) not to engage in the persecution too intensively due to secret political collusion.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It reads about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, suggesting: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those cavewalks, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all of Hollywood's Iraq movies were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always the following applies: When a star is driving around on the trouble spots or minefields of the world, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Some films will probably still mature - the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were at that time by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes in real time to two screens at home, also just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the lack of concern it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distant artist's view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When the one was questioned in parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic cancellation
The mayor's departure from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described a waiver as "not good for the business location."
No other project has recently developed such great motivational staff in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the momentum in sports policy would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which stems from a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sportbund for the beginning of December on an application by Munich for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period we have previously envisioned by 2028."
Still, the dream is not dreamed out for all time, von Beust said.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is also contrary to the statement of the Senate chief on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Federation.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 University "not as a replacement" for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The university sports association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD citizenry group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map of Olympia and excluded housing," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always called for an integrated planning for the Little Grasbrook for Olympia and a later residential use, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, in Sweden, fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
A large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" stoked doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968 a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequitted to the Moderna Museum in 1995 as a donation, are copies - and probably also the majority of the around
The prehistory is nested, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo."
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - turned hundreds of Brillo boxes out of cardboard: These did not come (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museum.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time were rightly incorporated into the history of art and auction as authorized original Andy Warhol-Brillo boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than 100 000 dollars at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only placed in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg produced.
At that point, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has examined not only the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, three of which were privately owned by the museum, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their pressboards were first primed and sanded, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint with a painter's roll without a primer was applied directly to the press chipboard - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, said in a statement: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibiting material."
Already in July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" made in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, people have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up who have entrenched themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer for any bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-loving soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The roughly two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Around half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly stand down with around 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops cordoned off the district around the noble hotel.
The president convened an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
“We call people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Her government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after just under 24 hours on the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
20.05 percent of the share capital is now held.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
Keep the option to increase the share of Versatel.
The move is intended to drive the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Previously, suspicions about an entry had already arisen on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares only a third party, it said in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already invested almost 10 percent of the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of this have been bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to acquire competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a good ten percent stake in Freenet and make no use of their right to take on another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase the stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is difficult to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connect customers by the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch has so far directly held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute another four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
