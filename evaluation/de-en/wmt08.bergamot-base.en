Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation, which is measured in the eurozone, is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, as the EU's Statistical Office reports in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are expected to be of just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate. In their discretion, the rate cut would favour rising commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is keen to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least narrowly, at the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a quandary: inflation must be "denounced" in order to rule out the need for action later.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve-year record high; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in food and energy prices is responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone.
MATIF wheat quotations rose 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also hit a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in inflation in cooking oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the coming 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate, but estimate the average annual rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly by early December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while approval for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among the party-loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two-thirds (71 percent) face a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry hurdle: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad," so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "quite bad."
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth assumes an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the prime minister's work as "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of advocates for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% of suspicion against the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of those who think you could get to grips with the dissatisfaction with the prime minister even without a change of government.
After the riots last October, 35% had advocated for the whereabouts of the government and the head of government, this share amounts to only 20% today, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they were "certainly" participating, and another 20% would "likely" cast their vote.
By comparison, if the general election were to be held this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty," another 15% consider their participation "probable." In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital daily allowance.
Transferred to the group of participants in the referendum "certainly" participants, the proportions of opponents of the tuition, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 81, 84, respectively. 89 percent.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by nearly a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelstrieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent again this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galloped away" last December, inflation has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared to the already high, earlier baseline level.
However, it certainly has a chilling effect on consumers that what they had paid for last year well below HUF 9,000 is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets studied.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices of turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy fever rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg bread wakes for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price crash on the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan performed the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has raised prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 per cent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between last year's cheapest shopping cart and most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forints, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected the trade: apparently, the department stores could not really decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unforeseeable.
(If the dealer plans the speed of circulation of a product poorly, he can fall by substantial gains in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the "Napi" shopping cart last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 around 1720 forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forints more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was found, the price of daily consumer products in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: For some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a more than 30 percent increase over the period of 12 months.
So in addition to flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has increased by barely more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning, there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals, which were due to an improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to curbing the infections, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
There was already a similar infection here at the beginning of the year.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Important surgery has not yet been performed because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
To 10. December of this year, infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System in 1094, according to senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were certainly registered in the hospitals, but the dark number is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without it causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, said Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," according to Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples too rare
The majority of infections in hospitals caused by MRSA would be preventable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should examine the admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the state health insurance.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has made strict recommendations on the use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease patterns in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary so that resistance to the agent cannot form, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among the outpatients or primary care patients, microbiological sampling is even less common, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Savings are made on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to the other by nursing staff.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also considerable deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds barely lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, unfortunately, it even happens in the financially less well-placed hospitals that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are adhered to, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting to grips with MRSA infections causes huge costs to health insurance companies, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment was recorded in the government programme.
After initial signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death handlebars police chief was not drunk
In the case of the Chief of Police of the XXII. Districts caused car accidents with fatal outcome are now the official report.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII. District that killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday was neither alcoholic, nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press secretary of the Budapest chief prosecutor's office on Friday, after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat at the wheel.
The former police chief bowed with his own car in the XXII. District in Kossuth Lajos Street and has run over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road in an undiscribed spot.
(According to the StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebars have, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra crossing, subordinated.)
The pedestrian has succumbed to his injuries after his admission to hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebars suffered a shock, then resigned their functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday. The money will go to education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which are implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement for 100 million has already been signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the €200 million in love.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the subway line 4.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro funding with the EU, the original treaty and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is attentive to the Balkan state, which was rarely mentioned before.
What, where, and who buys on the still cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis by the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and seafront homes.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russe is seeing more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, and thus attracting tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Forefronting investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are very important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group make up business people who invest with the goal of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 percent annually.
The inflation in property prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol.
A fierce debate is currently underway between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether developed countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s aspiration to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 levels), regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" would be successfully achieved. The Union would even be willing to advocate for a 30 percent reduction, provided that other major industrialized countries in the world, or Developing countries are also prepared to fulfil their commitments to the best of their ability and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the states that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU with its 15 member states at the time had already committed to a minus of 8%.
The requirement for Hungary is a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the UN’s International Nobel Peace Prize-winning Scientific Climate Change Committee, in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and increasing the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos about against the Taliban-led operations on the net since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The footage, shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets, is checked at the air base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are put on the internet.
Political message unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The UK Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeepers (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual targets of foreign operations.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, such propaganda published in this way is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertisements, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the right to exist of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, also make it to the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the theatres of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos shot in action have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans, meanwhile, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-sacre simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she is hosting a work conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas spirit with tombola or toasts into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry will be held this year in the defense department, but not the employees of the ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are served by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department is providing around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (FT) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are slamming over the strands.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs's 4.32 million forint Christmas party will be held at the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola raffle.
The National Agency for Development (FÜ) held its 4.7 million forint-priced Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Center (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which was held instead of a Christmas party on the 7th. December held the Lucia Ball there.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was announced: There was no ball gown or suit obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are each preparing for puritanical celebration.
The Ministry of Health is hosting the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forints.
Self-Governing Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply toast with his colleagues in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, which is expected to attract 436 employees.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - around this money there is a buffet reception followed by an impetus.
Since the beginning of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate every year in this way.
However, there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Department of Agriculture invites on 20. January to a New Year's reception, the ministry's Christmas party is canceled this time.
The one hundred guests are asked to visit the castle Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the department, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally begin with a brief address from the minister and end with restrained feasting.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas party, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation are forming their coordination committee on Friday for the strike of indefinite duration, which begins on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the People's Vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work stoppage begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic obstructions are expected, since the railway traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 13 o'clock.
Details of Monday's strike will be jointly announced by the League Unions and the Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LEAGUE - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will put down work for an indefinite period, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
Should the National Council fail to adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only come to the vote on the health insurance law in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will have to expect significant traffic obstructions: the railway workers lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are stationary.
At the same time, there will be motorway barriers in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others are planning a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Union of the railwaymen VDSZSZZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by train, especially around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV strikes from the start of operation until 13 o’clock, at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 o’clock in the morning, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy put the work down for four hours, and the teachers’ union and the Democratic Teachers’ Union have to 2 and 2 or 2. called for 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike alternatingly at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic union of health and social care workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the trade unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft for health insurance reform and submits a new conception for social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three means that the eligible professional groups will be given access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport and has now called for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard raises state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk warning report" states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk poses the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic confrontations in the short term."
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposite".
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make sensible dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also thinks that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "significantly damage the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of trust in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the upswing, so that since the summer of 2007 several organizations that call themselves "national self-defense" have been founded.
"These groups have in common that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defensive tasks (disaster protection, national defense, order guard), citing the unfitness of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: This is all done according to the method which tries to camouflage various political aspirations based on the political and party discontent of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association therefore serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighboring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of his own anti-Hungary policy.
This all has implications for the region's political stability" - it said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion to establish the National Guard, with the argument that the organization's goal is "national protection."
In their opinion, a veritable "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria in the past 17 years, but the state remained idly and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have started a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they would establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published every year and, if risk-altering trends are discernible, public opinion is informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
In the EU and America, too, something else is meant by "holiday."
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and days off from work.
Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year’s Day, for example: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days – the latter alone so that the New Year’s Eve celebraters can rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th. March commemorating the revolution of 1848, and the 23. October, the day of the 1956 Revolution.
On the 20. August will be the founding of the state, on the 1. May the work celebrated, on the 1. and 2. We remember our dead in November.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in those cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be processed, has been set out for many years by the Minister of Labour in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to public employees and civil servants alike.
Excluded are only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays.
This year, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from the 24. December, life in this country remains a formal standing still, as most take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specially cancelled holiday.
Next year, more holidays will fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer reschedulings in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work so that people can stay home for four days at a time.
Saturday, the 26th April will be a working day so that Friday, 2. May can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling hangs with the holiday on the 23. October together: On Saturday, the 18th October will be Friday, 24. Have to work October in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely marked by the holidays, after from the 24. December everything lies and stops, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six chilling trifles to annoy work colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "color" into everyday life in the workplace.
The only question is whether one gets used to these small inconveniences, or does one better face the challenge and try to avoid these misleading, for other annoying situations consciously.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says one colleague.
That this has missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by maybe calling the marketing department and remorsefully confessing that you have forgotten to align the message (that’s the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
borrowed something that doesn't belong to you?
There is hardly anything more annoying than when you reach for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the staple was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, one should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-its out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: none more there, if you need it urgently.
Gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what made?
Where and why?
If possible, the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tied to everyone!
And if someone opens up and betrays us his innermost secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent like a grave, instead of aligning those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call the office to call in sick, citing an excruciating headache, because you are currently feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, indeferable tasks, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by the colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play along badly to your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could come between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Sum, giggles, phone calls
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggle of the colleagues?
Unintentionally, a telephone conversation that shouldn't have been heard?
You shouldn't annoy colleagues with buzzes, singing, loud conversations (which you go over their heads), trample, constant scolding or nagging.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not ready on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important message, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk yourself out of the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected by it!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or catch up on what has been missed, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Track pants and slips: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then you should dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to such an extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wanting to make it all right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio, a strange melody resounds: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that resounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not exactly spoiled us with quality electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jams differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar scrutiny is "in" again, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, made music himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because an inn does not tolerate two pipers - began to tread his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he only made it when he approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, named the almost only trendsetter that is also marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy," but no one was interested in whether they like to wear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - stand out.
With these songs, the English-based singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere at the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, which broadcasts pop music from early to late, has gradually set the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked about Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" doesn't exactly mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two castes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but it can also only be produced for the sale that makes it commercial music.
Even a good pop number can come from an honest motif.
The listener’s willingness to accept also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more closely because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Is it important to see who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
We never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but these in turn exist only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built up his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from the fact that you try again and again to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust in each other’s musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a draughtsman for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to assemble the choir from gifted soloists from the domestic music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then christened "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the tune the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically right away and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was pretty electrified at the time, but it also took the "divas."
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing completely together and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they were in the back was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgeting who came from where and where to go, we simply allow these certain wings, the wings of love to raise us.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or on "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove did not want to work for a long time, but gradually everything has come together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and also now that I have "let go" of the album.
Currently it's "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same."
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Groundless scammer
His former employee, Jerome Kerviel, is the name of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came in for almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel was only a great player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, in addition was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all the major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is rather weak psychologically," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as can be seen from the statements of Kerviel, which the French media published, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was make money for my bank," he asserts in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros, especially from the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had pay-off problems before, would run into trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and was right.
By the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," admits Kerviel, saying he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that he wouldn't be found out.
He even managed to deceive his bosses, even if the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
“I thought she was satisfying the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Still, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Already at my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With Allianz's shares, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on price losses of that title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or guessed it.
“As long as I made money, you closed your eyes.”
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for that.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they come to him?
He made himself suspected by a vacation.
“I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can generate 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) over the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to be allocated about 100 billion crowns from the "Companies and Innovation" program.
Most money, about $150 billion, will go into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative ventures.
The companies should thus gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous money acquisition from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan court upholds twenty-year prison sentence for ex-president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns) of financial fraud.
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will be behind bars again is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers to let Alemán serve his sentence at home, or whether he must go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved the government's money to accounts of foreign firms in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has drafted, and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The year for the current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented it, and the ČSSD could therefore not allow itself to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-noticed, yet highly important law in peace.
This is, in a way, paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful issue for the media, and that is why they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are legally obligatory, which is not only the pensions, but also social spending, which the "tacitly" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) decided in the last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary fiscal policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and reasonably under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to revenues from taxes, levies and bank loans, often issued debt securities in order to tap further sources of investment, through which they indebted their town halls in excess.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off this debt by mass selling of shares of the energy and other utility networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a period of growth for several years, like the rest of the world, of which the ČSSD boasts without ceasing.
That represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments indebted the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which is mainly attributable to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, seen on a global scale, are the least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, no wet social programs are necessary, which unfortunately have been inflated to a gigantic extent, especially in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in canceling part of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and, no matter who is in power, nothing will remain for it but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then ruling politicians become civil servants who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditures through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last decade, which only went.
If we do not want it to really come to the fact that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take in taxes and fees, want calm in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the American Fed is sending $40 billion at auction, and another 24 is loosening it up for the European and Swiss central bank.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to defend against or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is intended to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend," wrote in a report for his clients Bernard Baumohl of consultancy Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions in losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be achieved when decided to take this approach," said Kieran Davies, the chief economist of ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have heavy access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with implications for economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so, after they failed to do so, the so-called. LIBOR lowering the London interbank interest rate used in money lending between banks.
That means the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to the heating up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is reportedly hurting developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN's international conference on climate change in Bali, which is coming to an end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet," he explained that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a word firework that's just a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him, and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now interested parties could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book in his opinion.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and assess technical treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably complex.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not opposed to "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities manage to issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will take to the roads without a valid driving authorization.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have mostly exchanged their driver's license.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in the driving license exchange, the capital's offices are showered with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
In Prague, approx. 140000 drivers not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The issuance of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the issue with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to add 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the prescribed exchange until the end of the year and drive off without a valid driver's license face a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also have it ended with an admonition during the transgression.
In the event of a transgression, the penalty can rise to 2500 kronor.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive at all can be imposed by the municipality.
He could, it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to exercise mildness and to impose a maximum of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, but no one threatens a thousand crown punishment.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone must have, and indeed a valid one.
People who no longer want to drive should surrender their driver's license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, motorists will also have to gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this involves about 2.6 million other driver's licenses.
Court cuts penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of making common cause with David Berdych's gang, received 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
Against today's judgment there is no possibility of appeal, only revision in the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, but he is initially facing the first-instance judgment.
At other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
To more he cannot be condemned.
A district court found guilty in January of 19 people mainly for involvement in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today heard the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the indictment from the beginning on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, relatives of the police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, handed over information from sources of the police, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the spoils for this.
The prosecution is about offences committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, about robberies, the victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for presumption and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser riflescope and a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robberies.
In addition to almost 20 men in this proceedings, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others for further robberies as legally guilty.
Other men from Berdych's perimeter have to answer in another trial, further cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has so far been eluded to Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children swapped - Invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the aggrieved parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees with Veleba's proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's trial.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, however, we need the opinion that the other side had drawn up.
We will determine if it has any meaningful value at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," said Dostál.
The amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, an expert opinion served as the basis for compensation negotiations, which the University Hospital in Prague had developed for him.
According to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying strength and depth.
The men better tolerated the stress situation, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the after-effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola swapped on 9. December last year Nurses of the Maternity Hospital in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district captain of the Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian Height) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by law on liability insurance.
If in doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low damages to those affected, the amounts have been determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" brand.
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the designation "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to participate parasitically in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian at the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same opinion is also of Harabiš.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
raising money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
“After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitically in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that was not then related to the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
An originally fun action turned out to be a business and an entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports, even offering discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" show for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves to it intensively.
The cooperation of the parties now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to pile up, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until St. Never's Day".
The leadership role was then used by Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
This was to be a new king.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the royal parade in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka, too, can quietly register," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages dwindle
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The station wagon with the designation SW is still a little further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain, for example, about the too little headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast on
I only go through the interior for a short time, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I have objections only because of the meagre central tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the days when we might complain about too short seats or headrests.
The lateral support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as the space available is concerned, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In the Kombi, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the hold.
I have to call it (also because of the fold-up rear window) very well loaded and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, allow themselves to be pulled apart and also hold on to heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by a clearly 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to emphasize the positiva, I still have to mention the loading space that is completely flat after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kW.
And honestly, this is what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled with him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car isn't exactly folksy.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still to come.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beats once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper triggering, electric windows in the rear and and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but add the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
So all that remains is the decision to choose which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, which raises fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and scuffles among students have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to such an extent that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and pelted him with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushhouse and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned attest that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks are reported to be looking for work.
About 30000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an abundant extent.
Only on one island, however, you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the very end of the 20th. century.
One of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, was built, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, over the wide boulevards drove cars, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional, you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s are still driving around Havana today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and moist air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down considerably, nowhere can you find so many wonderful colonial sights in the vicinity as right now.
Other places are being cleaned out right now, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk that is unique in the world and attracts railroad lovers in particular.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives there, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most significant places do not leave out the majority of Cuba's visitors.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It remains to be mentioned that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Perhaps it also seems interesting to some people that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and fortune brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the pretty beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped make it go unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth to see interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Valley of the Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which enlivens after the darkness, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
Some people describe this town in the very east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
To be sure, this view is also influenced by the way to it.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is barely touched by human intervention.
UNESCO included this Eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage directory thanks to the unspoiled nature there.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can show the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains can be seen, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this could be written many pages.
But, as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, influences the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to Defense Minister Robert Gates, draft a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not proceed according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country in Edinburgh, Scotland, agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to more activity, Britain sees priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow residents to start a further development of the economy and security themselves," UK Defence Secretary Des Browne tells the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years, according to the American Army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have deployed about 40000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously reflect on the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop, said the same today.
“I’m not happy with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been a dispute among the countries involved in recent months over whether all allies in Afghanistan will do their best.
For passivity, for example, Germany was criticized.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" this week referred to the German soldiers as slackers.
"Afghan non-doer revealed: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will skyrocket to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech is subject to a national debt of 84000 kronor.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to default on 159.2 billion cons this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budget policy.
The Czech Republic's sovereign debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on the national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech accounts for a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was in debt by more than 111 billion crowns.
“So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we will potentially not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told the server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could get to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it should become apparent that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, that could last until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt grows
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The national debt is financed by Treasury notes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds of the European Investment Bank.
Domestic public debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kronor this year.
The state's foreign debt, meanwhile, rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
“The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly recorded in the case of bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of the national debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned for this year to take in 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of state budget policy.
This amount stems mainly from the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kronor this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is a maximum of planned funds for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kronor, a tens of billions of dollars in reserve to pay pensions, the financing of sovereign debt securities for 43 billion and installments for the bonds at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Khartoum's Unity High School, was apprehended at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
“The children are proposing eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Subsequently, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption “My name is Mohammed”.
The bear himself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simply that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, declared that he knew her well, and she never had done anything to get too close to a religious belief, “I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” which, in his opinion, is only an “innocent mistake.”
An opinion that numerous students share of the teacher, who describe them as “very attentive to their students” and as a “person who never speaks about religion” in the class.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given second name in the UK, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence for the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
“It is unfortunate that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status,” said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the fact that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to preserve the peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
“No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time,” he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the mediation on 10. December
The troika's mediators, which unites the European Union, the U.S. and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% inhabited by Albanian-speaking people, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko by the 10th. December submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika received the order from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation order to be placed on 10. December will end.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on a continuation of negotiations beyond that end date.
“Russia was and remains an advocate for a negotiated solution, a consensual solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of being under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
“Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached,” announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where these “negotiations of the last chance” have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province shared his regrets.
However, he added that the Belgrade-proposed plan for autonomy “belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.”
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence by the province.
Belgrade thinks that it is particularly fearing a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible,” he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto power.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the final say
"Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to the journalists that “the parliament of Kosovo will have the final say on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence would be carried out by the Albanian-speaking people “in coordination” with the Western countries.
Bush elicits agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday under his leadership, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy “the terrorist infrastructures” and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the “roadmap” for peace, which they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to clarify all outstanding issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This designation includes the three serious problems around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were expelled from their homeland in the course of the conflict of 1948, which lies in the present state of Israel.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the coming negotiations be conducted “comprehensively and thoroughly” and provide a settlement for all points, listing “Jeral, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security, among other things.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he committed himself to the fact that the coming ceasefire negotiations be conducted “directly and without interruption” and to make every effort to be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline to implement his “vision of two states,” one Palestinian and one Israeli that side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange with its withdrawal from all the Arab territories that had been occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view," says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Arabic-language daily, financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the policemen are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigations of the National disciplinary authority of the police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police van drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
“He had no operation, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light,” a spokesman for the police said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "without registration, i.e. not open for public road use" (see below), arrived, controlled by two young people without a helmet, "at very high speed".
“It rammed the left side of the police van after disregarding its right-wing,” a policeman said.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers a lot negative.
The condition of the car (dented fender, splintered windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the fierceness of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she has entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger," in coordination with the main public security line of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the responsibility of the police officers to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were listened to Sunday evening, have confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this small motorcycle approached their left side relatively quickly."
Yesterday, a kind of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had stuck into each other until the policemen managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsy yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly made the rounds in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out this matter concerning "any serious error."
According to a police source, “this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are necessary, and in which one must proceed very carefully.”
Libération has met an eyewitness of those few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
“We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw “a completely disturbed policeman who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unhoped-for situation of the young people, the policemen were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left.”
They have also applied heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces have not provided any help to the young people.
They have provided first aid to these young people.
The fire department came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her," the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tension is rising
On Monday, Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades that the law enforcement forces used there.
Those then threw stones with which they injured the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court's legal profession have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition activists, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations have taken place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (Northeast).
The lawyers' movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "urged the population to send flowers, and those apostasy to take an oath to Musharraf to the judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency.
Musharraf’s promise no longer applies
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday night.
He had to make re-election in the following days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in one in direct ballot on the 6th. October take a stand.
The chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
“All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional, and contrary to the Supreme Court’s decisions,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to issue the command of the army and become a civilian president “no longer applies” since the declaration of a state of emergency, the Vice Minister for Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to have his military uniform by the 15th. November would be handed over, date on which his first term as president ends.
The Vice Minister of Information has also confirmed that January's elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or spiral, still have a 5-6% failure rate.
According to the institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better “control of fertility.”
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
With one of five couples even calculated exactly to the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season when it seems most comfortable to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed at which it was organized, and the tools “crafted” by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to move it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew embarked on the restructuring of the module's solar panels, whose span is 76 meters.
And in the process, it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a trapped cable over a length of about one meter
The restructuring was halted so as not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-up and then repair another solar panel, whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle attached to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained physician was thus chosen to “operate” the “injured” solar panel.
After he had examined the damage closely, he severed the faulty cable and attached a kind of rails to the damaged area.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker, who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey racket, wrapped with insulator to prevent electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts aboard the station had conceived and “crafted”.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today to expect to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock market sanctioned
After the Group of Aviation and Defence announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to counteract the A400M’s arrears, EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to €21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to check its business forecasts for 2007 again referring to the arrears caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine, which delay the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to “between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus,” announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting their quarterly results next Thursday, he added, without further detail.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, largely due to the cost associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had scheduled a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting in the counting of the polls: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very sealed-off election campaign, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast on the public broadcasters to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything see through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite issue during the election campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without scams,” he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they have misunderstood themselves there.
She denounces an election campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, for former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrations had been sentenced to five days in prison, according to his lawyer still visitation ban.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much more questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The term of office yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, the 2. March 2008; the candidates have until 23. December time to make yourself known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will select government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes back even further: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized for five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again reconnected with the model of a paternalistic state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was followed by no terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “of their own free will give up the personal responsibility” which they briefly demonstrated after the disintegration of the USSR.
"To think for a long time?"
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian region chairmen) top the United Russia's local electoral lists.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, said: “To be thinking about for a long time?
Those in power are not so bad as to why they replace?
A heavy souvenir
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, documenting the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen over a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless with a “humanitarian” intention, i.e. individually and name-related, i.e. on the query of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, which were tasked with their administration, agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been in effect since yesterday.
Delicate information
The historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, “especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the intellectual disability of some deportation victims.
The inmates of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
“One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents,” Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Mutual trade between India and Europe is currently reaching around €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also his first foreign investor, but according to figures from the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
“A free trade pact will push the two economies tremendously,” Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants exchange “goods worth 47 billion euros” and “services worth 10 billion euros” every year, had this week declared Daniéle Smadja, Chairwoman of the European Commission’s secondment in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has “not yet exhausted its potential.” The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso will be present.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern, offering £10bn for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern over credit terms, and announced an offer of tens of billions of pounds with a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions in the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to give a significant portion of its savings deposits during the conservation phase, which was held at the 6th. December begins to offer, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, she states in a message.
The bank further declares that in this way on the 6. December at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the property tax rate and only up to 10. January.
That's seemingly the first time the BoE has circulated liquidity for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is “ready to take further measures to obtain the “different interest rates” of the interbank loans with its base interest rate from day to day.
The interbank interest rate, which differed from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has leveled off to 6.6%, slightly higher since the 18th. September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was created in the context of a socialist "niche" (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), stated about ten measures that had been adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the bulk of which were 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP flottante, a transport cheque or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes violent exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS's MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumours regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably be from 8-10. August on a 500-acre private farm approx. 40 minutes from Philadelphia to be held.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as a co-owner, has also taken care of production, the licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he has ever been there, says his company and that of Melvin Benn work side by side in parallel to offer the area a European-style festival event.
“We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working eagerly with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza festival back to life in Grand Park Chicago after it became a festival-profile in the world of festival in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events in 2007 have $9.8 million and $11.8 million each. $ in gross tax revenues can.
These two festivals take place in urban settings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
“The objective is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts together, to simultaneously give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter declines to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large," roughly the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee accordingly.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed yet when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, which has received the top independent promoter award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal, if none other than the Terminator opposes it.
These lure attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "delicate mandate" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think is the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The dark age had on the 30th. Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago a successful performance.
He will be featured at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be at the 30. Starz Denver Film Festival unveiled in November.
This month, Quebec also featured four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing a final-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the coming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that “purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that “the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. Due to the lack of secure equity funds, these invest mainly in bond funds, which are severely affected by the upgrading trend towards profitable assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, “especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve, a uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased price of crude oil and the risk of the increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
“The chances are not very good,” the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already had since its highest mark on the 8. November of 15,945.7 points lost a value of 4%.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy from the pension fund, which is made every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that this year things could develop a little differently; especially due to the final year rally already in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to the Constitution Day.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market tendencies.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near-technical level, which could lead to the fact that “a deviation from the index values could soon loom, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of the values that are supposed to drive the Ibex to new highs.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that this year it is the turn of the great values.
The value winners would include the two big banks and some real estate companies, “because the electricity sector will be too expensive at the appropriate time.”
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the rises combined with the banking and industrial sectors will go hand in hand.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
“The ACS has been on a catch-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path,” the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only had falling price history in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real-world final year rally.
This year, when the Ibex 35 caught up by 28.17 percentage points, December had a 6.68% price increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive year (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and can also boast a final-year rally will become apparent.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the strongest economic regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group is the jump to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations between the bank and the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday in the afternoon, although not for the customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores that, due to their location, can capture the buoyancy of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time matching them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of the opening hours will be combined with a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any major investments, but would be accompanied by an increased recruitment, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approx. 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We don’t want to be a competition for our customers,” explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have tentatively come to the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking personnel.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco is doubling its stock market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock exchange. The broadcaster he directed had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: “This is exactly what hurts me; not that we have a higher growth, but that we had lower losses,” he noted.
He emphasized that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain reduces its previous year's losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the goodwill now reaches the 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, making its market value at 2,193.46 million, half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, rises; in the case of Sogecable, 3,571 million, at Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it is “two similar companies”, according to Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level still seems uncertain.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its plan to become the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock market months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see the main factor in Telecinco’s better course of trading in the year that the company has had until now: In 2006, the company, headed by Alejandro Echevarría, initiated a 100 percent dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the likely growth rate, which will decline from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buy) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) as a result of the “multiple incentives” and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends in the face of “similar threats” (saturated market and worse economic climate) to reset expectations in both cases
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which was adopted on 1. November came into effect.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/amendments related to the project, the government published the provisions that emerge from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressional and Senate MPs, who in their negotiations and votes had the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, which ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneur activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which is re-establishing the investment services regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, increasing the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to offer financial advice to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory firms that merge with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalization of trading orders are added to the regulated circulation markets, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges the investment companies to express the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the control task of the CNMV.
The Economic Commission of Congress subsequently provided for further changes, with the decision that the debt bond, which is now subject to a high degree of risk to the investor, must now be considered “complex” financial resources, has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (U.S. Mortgage Crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
For its part, the Senate set out new positions in the financial sector, how that of the business mediator, who works on foreign account, does not need authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition simultaneously to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) is up five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator, which is used for Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union, provides the average price trend that occurred in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seeks a local and quality comparison to US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same procedure as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Bureau of Statistics (INE) warned that the early indicator only served as a benchmark, and therefore with the final result, which will be the next 14th. December is announced, does not have to agree.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a “temporary development”; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a “relatively high” level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that “even if the present figure is not good,” Spain’s inflation difference with the other members of the monetary union has remained “more or less” the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were “less surprises” in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
“We expected a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over €42bn over the next three years
Northern Rock's value holdings have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan due to the crisis in mid-September last year, and they now amount to only 12,000 million. Pounds (equivalent to 16,800 million euro).
At that time, the bank's assets were a record-breaking $25,000 million. Pound, a sum that has dropped considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers and also despite the government's one hundred percent guarantee that the money is safe will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin firm, which would continue to run the group under the brand name Virgin Money after the acquisition, will have to bring in about a quarter of the income of the UK banks that will be made up of the next three years' investment there to acquire exactly the £18 billion still needed to achieve its 30 billion target.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50,000 million. Pounds (equivalent to approx. 70 million. Euro) to flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, which still involves three other companies, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of participating in urban development corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, on the basis of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and chairman of the Totana Municipal Council at the time, last May, and could be the original mastermind of the plot, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the “popular” and consequently privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested in leaving his client’s residence on the basis of important incriminating documents that are said to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the supposed order payments of Morale to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, if an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the government president and secretary general of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of Congress president.
José Blanco, organizing secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced in the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, since it is “important in politics to be able to count on the best” and Bono “is among the best.”
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the politician from the Mancha would “seem to be” running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress president. This one had the past 15. November announced that it will no longer be running in the next general elections, to end his career in public policy and instead to advocate for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that the president had been continuously pushing for his return to political events since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for the Economy, the party did not want to deprive the citizens of who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and described this as an “act of transparency”.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to convert the chamber into a “house of respect and not of insult or cry” in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
“Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can’t speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and “his good work” and indicated that he did not want to give the appearance of having already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this “arrogance”.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is relentless criticism for both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must show a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of the President of the government, Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a “new treaty with the planet”.
However, this proposal brings him in need of explanation regarding the action, or Non-action by his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain being at the top of the countries that have the least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol within the EU.
Who are responsible for failing to meet the requirements to which sectors this is attributable, and why did his government, which proposed the “Contract with the Planet”, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has provided for against climate change without further ado.
Which companies will be affected, what behaviour of the citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what economic consequences result from this.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, there are and will not be such explanations in the future.
It's because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero in terms of electoral strategy that he was forced to take back the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise suitable for election campaigns must neither talk nor accuse nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding edition, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-owned village of Totana, the “popular” politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody on the alleged suspicion of urban development violations, it said today from investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is located until now, surrounded by numerous agents, who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction management "Suelo Industrial y Vivienda".
The three arrests are related to the manhunts that had already taken place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, which found that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped building ground for urban development projects were to be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company “Nuaria”. This was to build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration sent it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales is also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the group “Nuaria”, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of “Suelo de Inmonuar” Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of “Nuaria” and received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against Urban Development Offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies that were directly related to the arrests that took place in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farmer, who is said to have acted as a middle man.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia village, which was to include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of space in Totana, which had to be rebuilt. The aim was to achieve a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking lots of the Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term “Book of the Month” and instead try to invent a price name of another name with appropriate competences.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, incidentally, is at the head of the PISA study), which comments on the note published in the same newspaper on 18 November; coincidentally on the day of which contained the criticism of the book of Blackburns.
The content of the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who cited the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on the teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and proposed to remove Plato’s teaching from the sub-level curricula for philosophy at grammar schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be subject to six months imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute results in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Under Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, the authorization of which has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor presents me with one of his long, strange research articles titled: “Money leads to the activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.”
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, “the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his teammate failed.
The researchers were able to recognize that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and therefore also got the same content; but if one of them received double, a stronger brain activity also occurred.
I am not quite sure if it actually requires so much scientific effort to arrive at such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her seat is in the public prosecutor's office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely, ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain on the loose.
Their names are on a list, which the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film "La Liste de Carla" (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track down the escaped criminals and to put the respective governments under pressure.
Which insurance is best for me?
The vehicle insurance, which covers a possible claim caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and used, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is set out in writing by means of an insurance contract that stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding severance amount in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance company, which is composed of several factors, including Age, gender, time of creation of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or used.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accidents, higher contribution payments are also due.
For this reason, both over-25s and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, these tend to less accidents such as single persons.
The benefit attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also thoroughly study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance company in order to be able to make not only a performance-based but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-priced insurance, such as the low driving experience and the “young” driver’s license.
Even if it were best for ideal insurance coverage to take out comprehensive insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-coverage comprehensive, so that the benefits of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the lower the amount to be paid," explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to your own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs; this will increase your credit by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit note is a reduction in the basic tariff at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase of said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depend on the company and its income.
If the company has had a profitable year, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments," explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for a comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
“Normally, the young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving,” explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the “beginner’s fear” was removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not own children to take out comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person also allows.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly low their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a comprehensive insurance with deductible (with an amount around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit note, an extended insurance is recommended, which only starts for the third year of the vehicle.
“They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment,” Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full comprehensive insurance with a deductible (with an amount around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, one has to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damage, but also because it entails high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hope for the point for the quarter-finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they lack in order to achieve their respective goals even before the conclusion of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still need another to make sure that FC Shakhtar will not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points with six points.
The two matches of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round of matches, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will compete for the final for the first time in the semi-finals, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be completed in front of everyone else and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the ever-expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow know that they would be first in the event of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the quarter-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be enough in a defeat of the FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because with nine points tie, the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to spoil the evening for the Scots. Who, in turn, hope to reach the quarter-finals of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the previous season in the exact same round by a goal from Kaka in the post-match period (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the first leg.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the quarter-finals and his membership in UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could win third place by a victory, despite its lower standings and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the starting signal for their first tour after the band’s breakdown in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunified band was "excellent."
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the history of the band, which had caused a sensation in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which is released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The sportsman was among the fan crowds in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although his spouse Victoria's nerves had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star “has never seen our wardrobe once, and therefore I’m already very curious what he will think of the performance.”
“Sporty Spice”, whose exit from the group in 1998 “due to internal disagreements” led to the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought, why not; so I’m glad to have made this decision,” Chisholm commented on the breakup of the band that prompted them nine years ago.
The singer also announced that “the disputes have been eliminated and everyone is now very happy again.”
However, many things have changed since the last performance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to the report of the television channel CTV, the group arrived in a special aircraft of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will next perform in California, in San José (on December 4) and in Los Angeles (on December 5 and 7th).
In Madrid, they will take the stage on December 23.
New fears over natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is simmering between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of hurting Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are routed through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is being watched very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states at talks," Ukraine's economy minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove up prices dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said. outside
The recommendation of main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought into connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also raised concerns that the Scottish State Health Service did not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign staff.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the suspected car bombing in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks in advance of employing foreign staff to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to operate in the United Kingdom.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, these have not been routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative policies with high degree prior to employment, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health service staff is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks in the run-up to hiring potential NHS staff.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was probably higher, also because the board members had problems identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures have been overwhelmingly adhered to by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
This includes passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for checks before employment begins for foreign staff at the NHS.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices in updated guidance regarding the check-ups would be reflected in the run-up to the employment of all staff - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for best film.
Prizes were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, the director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was named Best Leading Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for making British film public.
The prizes were handed over in a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, he has earned the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - as best director and best director debut.
Rock music was the focal point of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer got the award for best documentary.
The award for best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-playing thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the award, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it has arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as on clerics and security forces.
State television from the world's largest petroleum exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to a Home Secretary statement, says that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who immigrated into the country illegally.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of those detained were planning to kill clergy and security forces, according to the report.
The government has warned clergy more to do to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias regard many clergy in Saudi Arabia as in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target it at the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities in the energy sector.
"This was a very large effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims who are being burned as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a glimpse of the Earth's future
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on an orbit shows that the planet resembles a remote twin of Earth even more than was previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor on Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation pace, Venus embarked on a very different developmental course.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the planet for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different to that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
“Our new data makes it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
'Enriched uranium' seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Even so, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions that are on Wednesday night, the 28. November, raised, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party breaking up into next year's election.
It's not known, just like the producers of CNN who co-supported the debate, the YouTube clips to be shown to the budding candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one dedicated to a single issue, the focus was on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a dial when they heard things they liked: the television outlet noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Romney, who has pushed himself forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call that he was lenient to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly fiercely discussed as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on the issue.
Neither men have serious chances in the nomination, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they've hit the immigration timpani earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates broadly share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world, are helping Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani taking the point that although the Bible was his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to see if Jesus would endorse them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his applause storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two have shot up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the start and convincingly united with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this one isn't particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility appear to have been sold, no politician's Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the revelation that a rich businessman has concealed donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party failed to report this one is something without the embattled Gordon Brown would have done well.
When two months ago the prime minister had evaded the call for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly astute representative chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-dreaded Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean developed.
The awkward rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have raised business associations against the government.
The tax authority loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative squids.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the multiple donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and their former fulfillment leader) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown irrevocably sets off towards resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to govern.
Neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually withhold their skepticism when a new force takes office.
If it is once clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he doesn't even need to be at it for long, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as chancellor of the Treasury Department.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishaps - as in the long "money for nobility titles" investigation of political party funding - voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown's location isn't quite as bad as she looks
The misdeeds are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely swathed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new talk about political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but he was not entitled to the decision.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal will, of course, have to face some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
Yet so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest he knew of these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after taking office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down that determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the issue - to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned from it" are not very complicated.
When the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown must do, like finding something permanent chairman for the independent committee on public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a thorough reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour's hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unassailable righteousness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis infecting America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's just natural for dorsal fins to swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is ailing, the predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rises in both debiting and late-lending rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not collectible or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card takers.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and latencies are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3,89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in American private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of registrations (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that the output volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt, now that home loans are drying up.
However, the card issuers look to the flow of money instead of capital values, which is why falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates drop when the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial officer.
Even if a sudden underfunding crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit mitigation push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep a look out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron's former chief financial director, Andrew Fastow, on Wednesday, changed their petitions into guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven counts of fraud using telecoms for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The proceedings had been scheduled for January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecoms.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK over the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's aware that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations that helped rip the firm into the bankruptcy vortex.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others were cashing in about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty on two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and a month at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the loose on the basis of a $1 million bail requiring them to live in the United States in anticipation of legal proceedings.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer obscure the billion-dollar debt or make weakening ventures seem profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles related to the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not at the very bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for that many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the millionaires' exhibition, a four-day orgy of on display, hosted at a nested exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition stands, hoping to get new Russians interested in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas in its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in droves, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian high-flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible generous money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry has attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had attended the fair for the first time together with the brand's Russian dealer, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“The women are all exemplary cared for and the men are all worth a fortune.”
While they move through the halls Sunday night in eveningwear, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've looked for the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to target it primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic jams for several hours to visit a trainy warehouse that trembracefully put Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears side by side.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt picture made of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
“Of course, Russians are more interested in climper-climbing.”
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
and some of them bought.
On the show's first night last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his firm had sold the glaring orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A., said. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requests, it would have sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are like interconnected chain bands, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-set.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Mr Karapetian said.
“He’ll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're presumably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you believe.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red phone booths based on the British model, which were crammed with mountains of false million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed out 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaires' fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the piles of money around, mobile phone photos while they sit back in the midst of the spare wealth, snapped by friends, or simply to pocket a few million.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Bottled operation suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
There was a police car there soon after.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the van of the medical moronist approaching," Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure carried out by an unapproved, cosmetic surgeon whom police did not identify, and who worked at the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help clear up a mysterious death that sent a mourning by the leadership of Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F, since September 2006. McCarthy, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," Mr McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pit bull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankov, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unapproved surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the scarce front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel inscribed with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him find his way in the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to the rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes the central bank will try to calm credit markets through further rate cuts, were boosted by appeasing comments from the vice chairman of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's chairman, said the policy needed to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm grievous markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said recent turmoil had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October."
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments have been picked up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further rate cuts.
The remarks also helped Wall Street calm down, given further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil have been underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39bn to the value of UK defaults.
Germany's index Dax rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the reappearance of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand was awarded at a considerable 4.7 percent at an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Commercial Banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed further capital into the money markets in London increased when the credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" rates for borrowing between UK banks rise at 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21. November.
England face decision on Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's statements
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is on call at least under this particular title, here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table from High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those on part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness instead of ability.
It's not just in cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good deals that know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricketer, unless given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a big influence on decisions, but chances have this.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better than last season, for example, when James Anderson were, who is apparently going to play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind cones into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and are hoping for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference after all.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant Test cricketer and who, although he scored a double-hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in the wake of today's net meeting at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience about Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, speaks, and an excellent record against shot-up balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in the May against West Indies in the Test in Lord, his homeland arena as a player from Middlesex, and this one, plus his immediate rejection from the pickers as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his punch, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovel-wise joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from that was put to the point when he recently knocked over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was get his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm: "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a much better fielder, he cones his middle pace with some effect here on the pitches, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be doing well after all, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed a lot of doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his powers to be put back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia has helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizens" who defend their neighborhoods armed and in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and drying up funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will again stoke sectarian tensions and there will be conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one education field does the Saarlands push the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I got to the 50 yesterday. Once a non-Saar country declares that we are not French" - this slogan is self-deprecated by the smallest federal state to its 50. Birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries by tradition.
The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But even the state children bring the Saarland in above-average numbers to the universities - many of them without a degree at the high school.
"In Saarland, you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their eligibility for study at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also comparatively much developed.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"At the general education schools, we have initiated a number of reforms after the first Pisa study," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
So that the children start to learn earlier, the last year of daycare is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now also copying.
Future comparative studies will only show whether the performance of the students improves sustainably.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students shrank from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bayern are doing better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlands, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory at high schools - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On the 9th In December, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is becoming a joke.
According to a new law, the watches are set to the world time minus four and a half hours, according to a new law.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S.-hostile Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by saying that the United States had imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair, the break-off of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was Uribe's decision to strip Chávez of the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new mobile phone ringtone causes a furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist at the recent Ibero-American summit and had crossed his mouth.
Germans threaten wage minus in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are projected to face a real wage loss this year.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect less in the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy," Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
New burdens could also apply to workers when it comes to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the price explosion in food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hell of the Earth's twin
Venus, despite its hostile atmosphere, is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected it's flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are said to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there's ever been life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there should hardly be anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's devil twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s, no probe was on the road specifically to explore this planet.
The latest research, now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only highlights the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the commonalities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially thought," the Esa said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, is almost as large.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, circles around the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 days of earth.
Although Venus hardly resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
German President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but defended Merkel from the accusation that she is running a new China policy.
“The Chancellor has not refrained from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly indicated displeasure about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, lamented the Union's "schoep window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to information from the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to secede Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social discontent in Germany does not discharge itself in violence on the street, demanded the Federal Minister of the interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We have to make sure that social explosives do not also build up with us and discharge into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" published in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal, state and local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, this is already showing first successes.”
However, it is too early for all-clear.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, youths had delivered heavy street battles with police over the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is "above average."
Above all, more training places need to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give the young people a perspective."
But the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, "social control in the families takes place."
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warned: "But still we have to be careful."
“We must quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training.”
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were deployed, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The relevant authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the previous day, a number of around 1000 security forces have provided peace of mind.
The police will crack down as long as it is necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the aftermath, the unrest spread to Toulouse.
The riots ignited from a traffic accident in which two youths died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police bear no blame for the death of the youths.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor’s appearance far from reality documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content – and that nothing can be expected from it itself.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was sly and low-stop, one must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be governed by it.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, and showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are all about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a detached politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the rough even there.
Example climate protection: It praises itself unchecked for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodesty, the CDU leader would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing arrives at the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of beautifully speaking the world.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a fringe phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses left for it.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child surcharge.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
It stumbles as if on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department Attack
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard exchange of blows - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unloading on the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This, for his part, counters with serious allegations: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani counters, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of privately employing immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blowing to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via Youtube are little more than a keyword giver.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is heavily read by the Vietnam veteran to the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the reactions of the hall audience in St. Show that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause burns up in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, crunching, making a plea in front of the base and television audience for the fact that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to a snare when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs for the first time in civilian
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bending over international pressure, particularly from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now governs for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency, the Musharraf on the 3rd. November had imposed.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the state of emergency was imposed with him weighed in early November, had all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on the 6th. October rejected.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is making music again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
The revival is a recording from her great time "Live 1974".
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The scheduled sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is perched in the flower-white shirt at 63 years old in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is wrought concentrated on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves much.
The fact that the band Harmonia is making music again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Targeted requests revealed that the name was buzzing through collective pop memory, but by no means so lasting to miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is called misleading Krautrock was always more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Prize for life’s work in 2003, the hall was seen in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in foreign countries is one thing.
Memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia because the trio existed only for two years and in this time also developed a far less power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped out briefly at Kraftwerk and subsequently earned a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother succeeded the cluster musicians into exile after Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-fugitive communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in a pointed artist's existence.
Allegedly, a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art was found in the bulky waste.
Some things held Harmonia of it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as calm and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The rice collecting was not only for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-strong record backdrop, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the Eighties and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Brit, Altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also Loveparade inventor Dr. Moth.
This would outline the entire range of the influences of the Krautrock on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the vacancy of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you own the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
The legend formation is used by projections of other black-and-white photos of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to elicit the instruments from the instruments via self-made effect devices unheard of.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth in-the-art inventors.
The choir of the house does not change this either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, people cough and whisper under sound clouds and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a nice place with emphase.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who shouts "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia does not let it put you off.
Even the most natural thing is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or give fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace" are once again dealing with two films with the Balkan war.
Yet both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and geballer or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, the actor Richard Gere has now been found there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many nice-insignificant roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove out the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted" (Why do movie titles today always have to be as long and confused as locomotive driver collective agreements?).
He provides a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek representation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long behind him his very best, but who, even as a ruin-like monument of his decline, has retained considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party," along with the German production "Murderous Peace," which also kicks off this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
With "Murderous Peace" you can make short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, whereupon one promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the television-flat film loses itself all too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored by way of example why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian overwar criminal "the Fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go to the forest to accomplish something that the military can’t do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with heart as he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in a time-lapse procedure what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave it to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree for once) not too intensively due to secret political collusion.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionately, I see the swollen forehead veins, suggestive: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all of Hollywood's Iraq films were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applies: When a star drifts around on the trouble spots or minefields of the world, then something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some film will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now considered classics have by no means been unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes in real time on two screens at home, also just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the lack of concern it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The great dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distant artist's gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan war, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic cancellation
The mayor’s backing away from Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has met with severe criticism from politics and business.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust calls for realism in assessing the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described a waiver as "not good for the business location."
No other project has recently developed such great motivational staff in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, the sports-political momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which assumes a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund on an application by Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected for the beginning of December.
“This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period we have previously planned until 2028.”
Still, the dream isn't dreamed out for all time, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to obstruct an opportunity by already burying the plans at this point," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not as a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he put on the map Olympia and excluded the housing construction," said the SPD lawmakers Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for integrated planning for the little Grasbrook for the Olympics and a later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time had generated a great deal of enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had failed Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Those who associate the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, fabricated wooden boxes in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
The majority of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" stoked doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968 a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a donation, are copies of the majority of the art market.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-and-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo."
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time were then authorized original Andy Warhol-Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm" rightly entered the art and auction history.
Some of them have raised more than $100 000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg produced.
By that point, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three from Swedish private ownership, two of whom were made in Stockholm in 1968: their pressed chipboards were first primed and sanded, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint with a paint roll was applied directly to the pressed chipboard without a primer - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve said, "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "serious accusations" that are made in matters of soap powder boxes.
But since then, people have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebeling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebels have given up who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer for bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and voter fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government-aligned soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under the use of tear gas.
The roughly two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Around half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle with around 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces cordoned off the district around the noble hotel.
The president convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other Army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila’s financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after barely 24 hours at the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in telecoms company Versatel.
The average price per share is €14.46, the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
Keep the option to increase the share of Versatel still open.
The move aims to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Previously, suspicions about an entry had already arisen on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares only a third party, it said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already invested almost 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of this for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a good ten percent stake in Freenet and make no use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase the stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is difficult to see through, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connect customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute a further four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from investment firm Vatas had already been agreed in August.
