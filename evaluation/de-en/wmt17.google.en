28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently relocated to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim&#39;s brother testified that he couldn&#39;t think of anyone who would want to harm him, &quot;He finally got better.&quot;
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Coroner&#39;s Department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim&#39;s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, landed his dream job as a chef at Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot;shocked and devastated&quot; by his death.
&quot;We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him dearly,&quot; the rep continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank&#39;s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that &quot;things finally started to pick up for him.&quot;
&quot;He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,&quot; Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he couldn&#39;t think of anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always cooking us something, making us dinner,&quot; said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who went with the flow.
&quot;With everything that&#39;s going wrong in the world, he was this diamond in the rough, shining bright every day,&quot; he said.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the SFPD hotline at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I&#39;m always pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston doesn&#39;t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this unmistakably clear in an interview.
&quot;I&#39;m always pigeonholed or given labels that have little to do with me and reality.&quot;
&quot;I myself don&#39;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.&quot;
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t give a shit about these things.&quot;
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered &quot;Miss Perfect&quot;, as she explains in the current &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.
According to the magazine, the actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with a loose bun and Mexican food.
The question of wanting children makes her mad: &quot;We women don&#39;t have to be married or have children to be perfect,&quot; says the Hollywood star.
In her new film, Mother&#39;s Day, Aniston stars as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be on our screens from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: &quot;Golden Sports Pyramid&quot; for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered that they had finished work, they galloped home to the feeding troughs.
A kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t a good experience,&quot; says Langer.
And that was the end of his riding career.
On Saturday, Germany&#39;s all-time best golfer - 101 tournament wins - was back close to horses.
He and his family were shown around the ALRV facility, and he didn&#39;t even mount a horse to take photos.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and therefore also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the golden sports pyramid as part of a small gala.
The likeable athlete is not short of awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has knighted him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prizewinner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
&quot;This award means a lot to me,&quot; says Langer, &quot;because it&#39;s not only given for sporting success, but also for social commitment.&quot;
Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.
And so he immediately passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
Along with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the &quot;Hall of Fame of German Sports&quot; on Saturday.
The winners include track and field athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsledder Meinhard Nehmer, judoka Frank Wieneke, and show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company wandered into the Show Jumping Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was taking place.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
A comparison of Clinton&#39;s and Trump&#39;s economic policies: It&#39;s all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that&#39;s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
Underlying the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it small when in doubt and warns of how the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is campaigning for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has to open up opportunities for the disadvantaged and needs money for this.
That&#39;s why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close when it comes to infrastructure.
It must be invested in, say Trump and Clinton almost word for word.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.
Internal party discussions could therefore still come to Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the US again.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands: &quot;One country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs.&quot;
&quot;It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us.&quot;
But not only in terms of infrastructure - the two competitors are also not too far apart when it comes to international trade agreements.
Neither want to sign the TPP, the transpacific trade agreement.
At the same time, neither of them want to isolate the United States from international trade - they just want to better protect American jobs.
They should then also be better paid, demands Clinton, for example.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
It&#39;s not entirely clear what Trump wants to do on this issue: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says it shouldn&#39;t be changed.
But the major discussion in the coming months is more likely to focus on the tax policies of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to unburden the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of only widening the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants to demand at least that the rich pay more taxes, and her critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: &quot;Every refugee woman has experienced sexual violence&quot;
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby with them that is no more than one year old.
One put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with wide eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she&#39;s being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.
She is the division manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women fleeing, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women who have fled alone and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women&#39;s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard in front of the door.
&quot;It&#39;s no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while fleeing,&quot; says Bahr.
&quot;Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as beacons of hope,&quot; she says.
Other reasons for fleeing predominate among women: &quot;Many sneak away secretly because they don&#39;t see any other way out.&quot;
In their homeland they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her on.
This continues on the run.
&quot;It&#39;s not uncommon for traffickers to ask for a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water,&quot; says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is wrong, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often viewed as inferior and, in the worst case, abused.
As a result, she estimates that around 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized.
&quot;Some of the children certainly didn&#39;t come about voluntarily.&quot;
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
&quot;Or they don&#39;t dare to speak openly about what they&#39;ve experienced because they&#39;re too ashamed.&quot;
Since they often do not know what to do, Bahr demands that more accommodation be provided just for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked if they knew of a project similar to the one in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government&#39;s press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or separate houses only for single women and their children in some communal accommodations.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women&#39;s Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be accommodated separately from men.
According to a study published for the committee, &quot;It is very important that men and women are housed separately.&quot;
&quot;If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are housed together, there can be - ongoing - violence against women&quot;.
The washrooms in particular should be separate and easily accessible for women, according to the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen from the rush to the house in Munich.
&quot;Since word got around that we exist, we&#39;ve had a long waiting list,&quot; says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Residents on strike: calls for new industrial action
Residents&#39; deputies have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its full council to authorize more industrial action from early September.
JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
Residents and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained &quot;persistently quiet&quot; on issues, leading to the deal being rejected.
She said: &quot;In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract outright and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns.&quot;
In response to the government&#39;s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action beginning in early September.
The disputes led to resident doctors on six strikes this year, the first total blackouts in NHS history.
The head of the BMA resident physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the 54,000 residents and medical students voted, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for doctors in England.
Russia and Türkiye: An &quot;Alliance of Outsiders&quot;?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the Gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot help but get the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin&#39;s smile was tight-lipped and he barely exuded warmth, even by his reserved standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his &quot;dear friend&quot; Putin - according to one report, a total of five times.
I couldn&#39;t count anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to indicate the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow&#39;s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Russia in the back.
The offense was even greater since it was committed by an assumed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan&#39;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to record a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly impeached in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard -- particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring tens of millions of Russian tourists to Turkey&#39;s shores each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkey&#39;s agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: &quot;Tourists this way, tomatoes this way.&quot;
But the visit had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious with the West, considering its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
Add to that lingering resentment at the snail&#39;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to capitalize on the cool mood and dilute Turkey&#39;s relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected officials after the attempted coup.
Mind you, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this glamorous seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to portray what one analyst once described to me as an &quot;alliance of misfits&quot;: two countries, rejected and mistreated by the West, who are now joining forces.
However, despite the public reconciliation, major differences still exist between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even touched on the subject.
Turkey&#39;s President purposely avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities -- and given the potential for complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet -- it&#39;s certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank&#39;s CEO, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank&#39;s global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During this time, brand strategists have used &quot;RBS&quot; to protect other consumer finance brands.
She has supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship for everything from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all RSB credentials, decentralized headquarters and stock exchange listing will move to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller retail banking brands that will gain more prominence - Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands.&quot;
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I will now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities, and our associates will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has previously said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
&quot;It&#39;s time for us to evolve into the bank of brands because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?&quot; said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori makes his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that gives him a 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, coached by John Gosden, at his local circuit with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian becomes the sixth jockey to reach the flat racing milestone.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: &quot;It&#39;s special.&quot;
I&#39;m very emotional because my family is here too
I&#39;m very happy it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It&#39;s not a big gathering, it&#39;s not Royal Ascot - it&#39;s a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori records the cheers as he takes the win on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the Steeplechase milestone - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has amassed more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the finest jockeys of modern times and it&#39;s no surprise that he has reached a milestone that few have achieved before him.
He has style and strength, but it&#39;s his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the rest of the weight control room.
He&#39;s a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he wasn&#39;t just a weekend and major tournament jockey he would have already won 6,000!
Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but he&#39;s also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve wracking.
A string of major tournament wins, including his famous &#39;Magnificent Seven&#39; at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drugs.
He struggled initially three years ago when he returned from a six-month ban, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and get back to his best.
And he&#39;s far from finished - Dettori has previously said he wants to continue competing until he&#39;s at least 50 years old.
Russia&#39;s Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin&#39;s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old has been appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters.
A Kremlin statement said Putin &quot;ordered Ivanov&#39;s dismissal from his duties as head of Russia&#39;s presidential administration&quot; without giving reasons.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov&#39;s deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin&#39;s website states (in Russian) that he later served as chief of protocol and chief of staff of government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin: &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state in drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your directives.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step made Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin&#39;s closest confidants for a long time and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning of his own volition.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, with the general election approaching.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia&#39;s environmental policy - was met with widespread skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin&#39;s website, Ivanov said &quot;it is true that in an interview in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated - one could almost say - arduous post for four years .
As it turns out, I&#39;ve been the head of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB state security service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin&#39;s second term, since a third term for Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was filled by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson Fired After Beating Producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the show&#39;s set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produces the series, issued a joint statement announcing his termination.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, issued a public apology on Thursday before announcing his departure.
Artistic differences and a disagreement arose on the set.
I regret the incident,&quot; he said in a statement.
Details on how the character Gibsons will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma &amp; Greg, has been on the show since the show&#39;s first season in 2005.
&quot;I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past 12 years,&quot; Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that won&#39;t be possible now.
I just wanted to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most importantly the best fans a series could ask for.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Mystery of fish that ended up in garden in Banff
A Banff resident requested help identifying the fish, who showed up in his Banff yard.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandeels disgorged from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four &quot;deck fan&quot; closures nearing completion around each of the bridge&#39;s three towers.
The Fife bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 stay cables.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Business Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was among the first to walk from land to the bridge.
He said: &quot;This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions on this project, with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this portion of the bridge alone.
Despite the bridge&#39;s massive size and weight, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
Overall, nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place and the final section of deck is getting a deck concrete pour today at Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: &quot;The first closure is a significant milestone on any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents the future of civil engineering.
After installing the final road deck section and connecting it to the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was accomplished by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a gradient of around 3%.
Tricky as the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - just a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are &quot;lucky to be alive&quot;
Three men are &quot;lucky to be alive&quot; after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew witnessed the incident in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat proceeded under its own power.
&quot;We saw the boat spinning near them and imagined the worst,&quot; said Moelfre Lifeguard Director Vince Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, by the time we launched, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of their reach,&quot; he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all boarded the coastal lifeboat and were taken back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said: &quot;The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, this became detached from the person steering the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously injured - Man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured him.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunk offender cut up his ex-girlfriend&#39;s clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While destroying his ex-girlfriend&#39;s clothes, the 50-year-old called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she couldn&#39;t persuade him to leave the apartment.
So she left the house with her partner.
They met the man&#39;s ex-partner on the street.
When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig&#39;s cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more responsible in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next council meeting, the SPD proposes an &quot;Action Concept for Housing&quot;.
But arguments are programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far there is no regulation.
SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Bratmann says: &quot;We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban land, you have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future.&quot;
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in existing buildings.
However, according to Bratmann, the big point of contention in the town hall is: &quot;How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?&quot;
&quot;We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but if possible 20 percent, of the apartments on such areas as social housing.&quot;
A new city housing subsidy program, which will cost millions and has yet to be funded, aims to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: &quot;There is currently no agreement between the factions.&quot;
The CDU would like to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Irrespective of this, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is about to worsen.
If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the program is not complete yet: the approximately 1,260 new apartments should be built anyway.
But how do you make up for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, the funding for which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, the city should now buy up expiring bonds.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into price maintenance.
That is possible in Weststadt.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
Because in Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1,800 apartments could be brought back into the price maintenance for cheap apartments.
But the owners, the housing associations, don&#39;t want that.
Because if the number of social housing in Weststadt increases drastically again, you will move away from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few parts of the city should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group leader Holger Herlitschke says: &quot;For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board.&quot;
They have concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But that doesn&#39;t mean that a compromise can&#39;t be found after all.
Pokémon Go, a quest for health and happiness that&#39;s worth it
It&#39;s fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring instead to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and more active.
Screen time was initially limited to television, then video games, and most recently smartphones.
So it&#39;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.
I&#39;m referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later to become an animated series, game cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest waned somewhat ahead of the game&#39;s release in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be &quot;photographed&quot; (via a screenshot on the phone) or &quot;captured&quot;.
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze and jumped off the sofa in search.
In the US, the game resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps the &quot;average&quot; person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game&#39;s launch, the number of people being tracked doing 30 minutes of exercise each day increased from 45 percent to 53 percent started.
The company doesn&#39;t know which of these is playing Pokémon Go - it&#39;s just seeing the raw performance boost data.
Many public health education campaigns that try to get people to &quot;take 30 minutes,&quot; &quot;get off the couch,&quot; &quot;get off the couch,&quot; and &quot;be active every day&quot; have fallen on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and by people come who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As always, there are grumpy spoilsports who always have something to complain about.
And yes, someone could walk into a door.
What the hell?
A breakthrough has occurred.
While smartphone apps like Fitbit used to be able to track our activity, they didn&#39;t give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will diminish over time.
However, due to Pokemon&#39;s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles achieves gold in women&#39;s gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the bar.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant across the board.
And now finally Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympics.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well ahead of silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
America&#39;s Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the Women&#39;s Individual All-Around Final in Artistic Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win an all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, if not ever.
She burst into tears as her final score was revealed and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with routines so amazing that involve a mixture of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton said of her that she was &quot;the best gymnast is that I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
A final test awaited her in Brazil, a competition that wasn&#39;t so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes as between her and a burden of overblown expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be seen as disappointing.
America&#39;s Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning respectively gold and silver in the women&#39;s individual all-around final in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony for retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that she never planned for the future during her long journey to the top, that&#39;s not really true.
Some of her floor routines - which include her signature tumbling pass - are set to Latin music that would fit at home on the street outside the Rio Olympics arena.
This is no coincidence.
Adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman&#39;s mother during a school field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, this girl became a force.
She hasn&#39;t lost an all-around since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Balance beam and floor exercise - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She caught up again with a 15.433 on the balance beam - and followed that up with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her tenderly as they awaited their end result - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Bile&#39;s glossy red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman&#39;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, nicknamed &quot;Grandma&quot; by the Americans, had a head start.
After her floor exercise, she blew kisses to the audience, blown away by a comeback that at times seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old&#39;s fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week took on a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot dead in car while listening to music in serial killer case
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix&#39;s first serial killer case while talking and listening to music in the car.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis&#39; daughter Maleah were shot dead June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled in another vehicle, the report reads.
Police said the triple murder does not appear to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 belonging to one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look to see if it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks over a four-month period, mostly in Hispanic neighborhoods.
&quot;It&#39;s happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house,&quot; Howard told KHPO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used multiple vehicles, including a brown late 1990&#39;s Nissan, a black late 1990&#39;s BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later passed away.
Liner, 31, and Elli&#39;s daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, believed to be the serial killer&#39;s work.
Investigators found cartridge cases and secured a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: &quot;It&#39;s getting better&quot;
Like most 6 year olds Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of while pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can&#39;t do this.
I can not do this.
I didn&#39;t get involved with that.
Which isn&#39;t true at all -- of course it was accepted,&quot; she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing it.
&quot;My first response to that was, &#39;I didn&#39;t know people were still doing that,&#39;&quot; Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he&#39;s slowly making progress.
He can walk and bike with assistance.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund came up with for Please Sing Me.&quot;
&quot;We teach him sign language,&quot; Picciuto told CBS News.
But it&#39;s not typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic, such as Edmund, and viral infections, such as measles or Zika virus, during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It&#39;s too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional cost of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn&#39;t really know.
I haven&#39;t asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don&#39;t expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It gets better.
You know things will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding prompt rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks, threatening widespread flooding after heavy rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is on the way to affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor&#39;s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were mounting.
Steele said the Tangipahoa community alone requested 10,000 sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said the area could get an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain.
A flood early warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday while rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to hit record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will be slow to flow into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record as early as 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
&quot;We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in,&quot; said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen the river so high in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members all have disabilities and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were being held until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding &quot;spread quickly&quot; as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight through Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been significantly soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and canceled classes in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a clerk in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Community leader Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floodwaters.
Temporary shelters were set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
&quot;Once the water starts to recede, they will be able to go back to their homes,&quot; he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa Township, nearly two dozen roads have been closed due to flooding and sandbags have been made available for residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
&quot;The last major flood we had was in March,&quot; said Lacy Landrum of the city council.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported as of Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen water in places I&#39;ve never seen it before,&quot; Townson said, &quot;and it&#39;s still coming.&quot;
Mahaj Brown, 6, &#39;riddled with bullets&#39; survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a 6-year-old has been shot this week.
The boy&#39;s grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown sustained multiple gunshot wounds, including to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
&quot;He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,&quot; his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can&#39;t believe it.
The boy&#39;s condition was classified as critical at a hospital and he had to undergo multiple surgeries.
The boy&#39;s family told the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether the perpetrator could be underneath one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be crossfire between multiple shooters.
Assault rifle shell casings, traced to various assault rifles, littered the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
There were pods on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So there appear to have been several armed militants here who were very actively involved,&quot; Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the broadcaster.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit in the arm by a ricochet while playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Which is why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That&#39;s what I envision the women&#39;s Olympic gymnastics team for more reasons than one.
First, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
Second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot;Laurie&quot; Hernandez, who have been inspirational to many young girls of color.
The structure of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the USA.
It has solidified the Black and Hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in a women&#39;s individual all-around event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We&#39;re seeing the pinnacle of this sport, but that&#39;s not what gymnastics classes look like across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the &quot;bottom five&quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts on the team. Also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily work in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued at will.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
It is in these clubs that the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to make gymnastics training more affordable and accessible to the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my events, we&#39;ve provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and coached national and international winners.
In September we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to bring quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health, academic success, and professional success.
It&#39;s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that&#39;s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true display of girl power by winning the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to start their journey, healthy, strong and successful to become young women.
Residents want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt&#39;s proposal
Ministers had hoped to settle disputes over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 residents who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract into effect, saying the NHS was in &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot; and any further delay would be harmful for staff and patients.
The first residents are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of BMA&#39;s Resident Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: &quot;Residents continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all physicians fairly .&quot;
With just eight weeks left before the first batch of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have met with government reluctance to participate and at times a deafening silence.
That was on a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month about his door always being open.
&quot;Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, end the enforcement and address the concerns of residents.&quot;
Should he fail to do so, the interns have made it clear that they stand ready to pursue further industrial action.
The latest strike in late April saw the delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were brought in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to settle disputes over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 residents who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, urged residents to end the strike.
Mortimer said, &quot;Industrial action achieves little, but strains already overstretched teams and providers and causes only worry, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families.&quot;
Over the past two months we have spoken to the Residents Committee and responded positively to the concerns of guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health and other departments.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career sabbatical, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine Signs of this were how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honoring the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack sufferers will benefit from a £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to more people for a longer period.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeat heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of those suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fatty material in the walls of the arteries, which causes plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, thereby causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot breaks loose, it can travel through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, made by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots less likely to form.
NICE&#39;s draft guidance, released today, recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg with twice-daily dosing of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said: &quot;Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences.&quot;
Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person&#39;s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By tentatively recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness allows voter fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was ousted from office last year on corruption charges following a government report
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, a damning government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has verbally attacked the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse based on &quot;racial and religious sensitivities&quot;.
The former integration and local government minister, who is now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should be allowed to set up barrier tape outside voting booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry ID to prove their identity at elections.
Currently, a voter only has to give their name and address.
The report suggests putting permanent ink on a person&#39;s finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press should have more access to community records and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
&quot;This is not only to combat voter fraud, but also to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it,&quot; he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be impeached after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman &quot;cynically perverted&quot; the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have &quot;run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him.&quot;
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of impersonation, where one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He was particularly alarmed about fraudulent postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including carrying ID cards to prove identity
Its report said: &quot;Evidence has been put forward that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of their elders, particularly communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
&quot;There were concerns that ... state institutions would knowingly ignore such behavior due to &#39;politically correct&#39; racial and religious sensitivities.&quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling absentee ballots to stop &quot;electoral harvests&quot;.
The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll being used for immigration and welfare fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for their ID before voting.
Using permanent ink on a person&#39;s finger once they&#39;ve cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person&#39;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic vote-by-mail.
Prohibited political activists from editing complete mail-in ballots and mail-in ballot envelopes.
Give the police the power to set up cordons around polling stations.
A change in the law that eases a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photography ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters enter the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls for the Metropolitan Police and finds it &#39;amazing&#39; that no criminal charges have been brought in the wake of the Tower Hamlets case.
&quot;The electoral court has found Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit on a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,&quot; he said.
He was found guilty on a number of counts, sufficient to meet the high standards of criminal justice.
He also criticizes the ineffective &quot;check-off checks&quot; by the voter-registration departments in city halls.
Sir Eric said: &quot;Last year&#39;s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a red flag.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities is threatening that reputation.
Crazy about Kate&#39;s cyclist look-alike and other famous look-alikes of Rio Olympic athletes
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be a formidable doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-contending athlete to sport his own famous look-alike this summer - at least not according to social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are flickering on our screens these days, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a mere resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: US archery teammate Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Aside from Kate&#39;s velodrome double, many people online have hinted at how a certain Archer could be A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s twin.
US archery teammate Brady Ellison has caused a flurry on Twitter after pictures surfaced in which he looks eerily like the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer caught the craze on social media and admitted he&#39;s been told he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
&quot;I don&#39;t see a huge resemblance myself, except for the facial hair,&quot; Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s a handsome guy, so I guess I&#39;ll take that as a compliment.&quot;
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt draw even more attention this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Up a gear: This user thinks Nathan is the &quot;athletic version&quot; of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who sport similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver-medal swimmer Yulia Efimova sports more than actress Annalynne McCord&#39;s tanned skin and blonde hair, while American Nathan Adrian has been dubbed by fans as &quot;an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.&quot;
Strong Women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple&#39;s resemblance
One Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that &quot;the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.&quot;
In fact, US soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile nearly identical to actress Laura Linney&#39;s, and gold medalist gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful, wide smile similar to Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer &#39;died like a pig&#39;
Byron MacDonald&#39;s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan&#39;s fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of CBC&#39;s live broadcast of the Olympics on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &quot;went out like shit&quot; and &quot;died like a pig&quot; during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off as he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to add more &quot;color&quot; to the CBS commentary team, could be heard saying, &quot;That little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby.&quot;
Too excited, went off like fug, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swimming relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada&#39;s Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, &quot;Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China &#39;died like a pig&#39;????
The idiot didn&#39;t realize they were still on the air.&quot;
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final of the women&#39;s 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay: &quot;That little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby.&quot;
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many taking him to task
Twitter users didn&#39;t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: &quot;Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #disgusted.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald&#39;s comment, saying, &quot;We apologize that the commentary was broadcast about a swimming performance.&quot;
It was unfortunate wording, we&#39;re sorry it happened.&quot;
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the Twitter notices
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald&#39;s comments
The network was also quick to apologize and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our on-air viewers and our followers on social media last night.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments were about the swimmer&#39;s performance and not about her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying he did not mean it to be construed as a personal attack.
&quot;I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women&#39;s swimming relay on the CBC Olympics show,&quot; he said.
&quot;I was referring to the swimmer&#39;s performance and not to her as a person.&quot;
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I&#39;m very sorry.&quot;
Shoppers in Primark outraged at woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of the store
Shoppers didn&#39;t know where to look as a woman stripped off her clothes to try on panties in the middle of a Primark.
To make matters worse, she checked out how she looked in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried on four pairs of knickers in a shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the panties before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, &quot;she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything.&quot;
She said, &quot;People couldn&#39;t believe what they saw.&quot;
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of panties from the display, took off her own tights and pants, and tried them on.
&quot;She didn&#39;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar.&quot;
&quot;Everyone stared as she took off the panties, which she obviously didn&#39;t like as she put them back on the shelf.&quot;
She repeated the same thing with three more panties before finally deciding she didn&#39;t like anything, getting dressed and walking outside.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem bothered that someone was watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the panties she tried on.&quot;
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: &quot;How disgusting to think someone would take home panties that someone else was wearing that hadn&#39;t been washed.&quot;
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: &quot;I understand the staff tried to pull the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as well.&quot;
&quot;I would hate to go home with a new pair of knickers and find out that another woman had them on and took them off and they weren&#39;t washed.&quot;
A Primark spokesman said: &quot;Primark is aware of the incident that took place at our Folkstone store on Tuesday 9th August.&quot;
All eligible products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster at the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you&#39;re approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your predator.
When approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see your attacker and &quot;get out of the line of fire,&quot; says Mizrachi.
Then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then knee him in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker doubles in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while pointing the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can&#39;t shoot.
Simultaneously shift your weight onto the weapon and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of their grip before backing up and pointing the weapon at them.
Sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi demonstrates it.
But remember, unless you&#39;re a Krav Maga grandmaster, handing over your money is the safest thing to do during a robbery.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a guidebook
A British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, scraped his strokes on a euro note, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he&#39;s about to get into.
But the experiment, filmed as The Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength, unearthed some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may seem utterly repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Traveling Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about supporting gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he licked off left more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world eating weird and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely tested his immune system
In the film he said: &quot;Even as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, dirt, worms and muddy water.&quot;
In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was one Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have a reading of less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film The Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows bacterial counts in various places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, &quot;That&#39;s close to the worst thing I&#39;ve smelled in a toilet.&quot;
There&#39;s nothing dirtier than that!
I won&#39;t lick anything in here because it&#39;s gross in here.
&quot;The Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength&quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company supplies Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to help boost gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valio&#39;s Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: &quot;We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to watch while also explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorms that ended with us saying &quot;Let&#39;s call Ian.&quot;
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: &quot;Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian one Toilet shown in the film.&quot;
Of course there were things that were easier to get Ian to lick her and others that were quite difficult to do.
I&#39;m glad we caught some of these dirty treats on film.&quot;
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with gastrointestinal well-being and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Antisocial family vandalize council flats in Saltash, Cornwall before evictions
An anti-social family left their council house after being evicted with £50,000 damage for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing association workers found the property in an irreparable condition.
There were gaping holes in the walls, wooden floorboards were torn open, garbage was strewn on the floor and graffiti was scrawled on the walls.
The family have been relocated and are now believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works in property management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the flat is beyond repair.
She said: &quot;It&#39;s been an absolute nightmare for people here and I don&#39;t think people have to live like this.
There are many things to consider as this property will likely be viewed as a not so pretty part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the home at one point, and police said the terror inflicted by the family included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug dealing and excessive shouting, fighting and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an anti-social behavior order in June.
Old rubbish was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished
The wooden floorboards were torn open in the property where drugs were trafficked in the past
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The evictions were cheered by relieved neighbors, who said their lives had been made hell.
One testified: &quot;They cared about nobody.&quot;
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here is unbelievable.
&quot;We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.&quot;
We got up because it was so quiet here - we&#39;re not used to that!
Now that they&#39;re finally gone, it&#39;s going to be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing&#39;s Neighborhood Enforcement Manager, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which police were regularly called, for 20 years
Trash and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the meetinghouse
He added: &quot;It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her and her family&#39;s conduct as eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and her actions must have been horrific for her neighbors to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have bravely reached out and shared the information with us.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to some neighbors and send the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they are all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction
Property management workers will now have to clear piles of trash surrounding the home
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, along with scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to trade.
She claimed the money was for a headstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Having been homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will evict tenants who don&#39;t follow house rules
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who were breaking the house rules.
&quot;This goes out to those who feel they can behave without self-blame and to those who have been harmed by such behavior,&quot; she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior who will continue to work with partners to keep our communities safe.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sunbathers in Aveiro, Portugal got the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft performed an incredible dive
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment when terrified tourists begin to panic after a low-flying jet swoops over a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within arm&#39;s reach over sunbathers on the stretch of beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped when they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming their way through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: &quot;It flew by really really low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash.&quot;
Nuno Arroja added: &quot;I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me.&quot;
Tourists on Aveiro beach panicked as the plane emerged from the darkness and flew impossibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that it was the only way to spot them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force insisted safety was never compromised.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer, also killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that conditions - heavy fog and smoke from the fire - forced the pilot to fly so low, which reduced his visibility
The aircraft was on a training flight which required the pilot to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca worried about Sevilla
Seville – FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step towards winning the first title of the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans play away against Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup duel, with the second leg taking place three days later at the Camp Nou.
In the showdown with the defeated cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion, the double winner has to do without Neymar, among others, who is contesting the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a sprained ligament in his knee during training, which means that Barca&#39;s A-question has been settled in favor of Claudio Bravo, at least for the time being.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been vying for No. 1 status at Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far not made a clear decision in this regard and let Bravo go first in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Before the first competitive game of the new season, the Spanish champions have doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated 4-0 by Liverpool in a friendly on Saturday.
Even in the 3-2 test gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. didn&#39;t really know how to convince.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extra time in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph in the &quot;Supercopa de Espana&quot;.
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own with table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and &quot;holder&quot; Zhang Jike 4-0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world number one won the &quot;Golden Grand Slam&quot; with successes at the World Championships, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and the Olympics.
Bronze went to Japan&#39;s Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final and fought off the title amongst themselves.
So it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the individual title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS Lower Austria legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to their own devices on the plate, with no coaches with them between sets and during timeouts.
They had withdrawn to the stands and let their protégés loose on each other in a fair competition.
&quot;The matches up to here I have played for my country.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll play for myself in the final,&quot; Zhang said logically.
After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the plate, leaving Zhang with a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma&#39;s superiority, the exciting match that was expected did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking rallies to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4-1.
The Belarusian suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then under medical treatment and had to &quot;ultimately&quot; be content with sheet metal.
Incidentally, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) finished fourth at the Olympics at a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits &quot;huge problems&quot; in the election campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive concerns that even traditionally conservative states will lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally cocky and confident multi-millionaire voiced something of a concern, correspondents reported.
Having knocked out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the White House race.
&quot;We have huge problems in Utah,&quot; Trump said to evangelical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida and Virginia.
Blame false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds are shaking
Utah is usually a safe bet for Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were tied.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, when asked how he intends to stop Clinton&#39;s advance again, Trump replied: &quot;Just like I&#39;ve done before.&quot;
And pushed afterwards: This will &quot;either be successful, or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation&quot;.
He doesn&#39;t do anything other than &quot;tell the truth&quot;.
If it&#39;s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that&#39;s fine, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump&#39;s party threatened to cut funding to support his election campaign if he was unable to present better poll numbers.
Instead, they want to give the Republican candidates for Congress more support.
Olympia: Brazen cheating on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya&#39;s track and field athletes face trouble after the second doping scandal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After an attempted cheating at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said former sprinter-turned-coach John Anzrah provided a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter sprinter Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The world association IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to conduct its own investigation, said an IAAF spokesman.
&quot;Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment,&quot; said an IAAF statement.
&quot;He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and posed as Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample and signed it,&quot; said Kenya&#39;s chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He held the accreditation of the athlete listed for out-of-competition testing by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth at the 800m World Championships in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, the head of the Kenyan athletics delegation, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under close scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.
When the IOC announced the more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular would be targeted.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping policies are compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country&#39;s track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, accusations were repeatedly made that doping substances are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is said to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was possible to prove that this sport was doped across the board and systematically.
Russia&#39;s track and field athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg &quot;West Side Story&quot; with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival is presenting &quot;West Side Story&quot; with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Leonard Bernstein&#39;s masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: &quot;This music is full of rhythm,&quot; he enthuses.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin ingredients in its tempo and melody.
It&#39;s a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein&#39;s music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She nostalgically recalls her love affair with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because she is musically exceptional!
And then there is Maria&#39;s personality.
She says it in her song: &quot;I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright&quot;.
So she&#39;s smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
&quot;She&#39;s very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman,&quot; laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: &quot;Cecilia is a wonderful artist.&quot;
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an incredibly generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: &quot;Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!&quot;
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in his every move, in his looks, it&#39;s his life!
It&#39;s such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that&#39;s very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, &quot;West Side Story&quot; is highly topical: &quot;This play is about prejudice and fanaticism.&quot;
Today we have the refugees, back then the Puerto Ricans went to New York and the New Yorkers didn&#39;t want them.
They&#39;re the same themes, and they&#39;re just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join ISIS last year, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was suspected to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group&#39;s stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 and died shortly after planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England, according to her family.
&quot;One can only hope that the only good thing in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - is to prevent people from ever making that decision,&quot; Akunjee said .
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then a bus bound for the Syrian border.
Sultana&#39;s family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within months.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democrats, is convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland&#39;s confirmation since Barack Obama&#39;s nomination in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next President will name the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland &quot;with a certain degree of certainty.&quot;
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton&#39;s team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocking Garland&#39;s nomination were lackeys and accomplices of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for &quot;women and for men&quot;
Treats Magazine has teamed up with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired 2017 calendar.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats Editor-in-Chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differed from old-school Playboy because &quot;Playboy is for men.&quot;
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar does too.
&quot;We need to get back to depicting timeless and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,&quot; Shaw said in a press release accompanying the calendar&#39;s release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Türkiye: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
&quot;Anyone who doesn&#39;t conform and praises Erdogan is sitting on a packed suitcase,&quot; says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Dialog und Welt Foundation, which is close to Gülen.
The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be &quot;several hundred thousand,&quot; believes the chairman of the association, Ali Toprak.
Because of the harsh actions taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
&quot;In the short term I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term several hundred thousand people from Turkey seeking protection in Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,&quot; said the association&#39;s chairman, Ali Toprak, to the &quot;Welt&quot; on Friday.
Because the government already carried out punitive actions in Kurdish strongholds months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the failed coup, there would be secular and oppositional ethnic Turks.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
&quot;It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,&quot; said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave the country.
&quot;They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years,&quot; said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government &quot;position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters&quot;.
A &quot;witch hunt&quot; against critics of Erdogan is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the past few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
&quot;Anyone who doesn&#39;t adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on a packed suitcase, including the Kemalists and secularists, by the way,&quot; Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Dialogue and Education Foundation, which is close to Gülen, told Die Welt.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the putsch, the Turks made up the largest group of people entitled to asylum in Germany who were recognized because of political persecution.
As of June 30, there were 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as entitled to asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or a lack of prospects.
According to the Basic Law, only those who are individually persecuted for political reasons, i.e. by the state, are entitled to asylum.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: &quot;Go where it hurts&quot;
Weird Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals don&#39;t hear anything about the summer election campaign - and vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood.
In 2021, the state elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn&#39;t get any stupider than before: summer vacation, heat and the state election campaign - that bites.
The locals who are supposed to be persuaded by the campaigners are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals and are therefore not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who put up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end are difficult to find.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last day of vacation, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to endure another election campaign that narrowly misses the people.
The hot phase, if you can even call it that, has just begun.
And it&#39;s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be exciting to see how strong the newcomer AfD performs and what is left in the end that is suitable for a coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is conducting an almost inconspicuous election campaign apart from his large posters.
He travels through the country, hands out roses and chats a little with the people, just like his legendary taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blossoming of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your &quot;we can do it&quot; have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen what it&#39;s like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel&#39;s federal constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group wasn&#39;t right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than people from Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
&quot;The majority was probably from other federal states,&quot; Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently complained to NDR.
But it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on market squares and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a &quot;subordinate role&quot;.
The Union has also noticed that its base in the country is crumbling, that it has to make a lot of effort to reconnect with the people.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly exist.
However, the advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his comrades-in-arms is also self-explanatory: &quot;You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used&quot;.
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to campaign particularly hard.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind their partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make it into the state parliament.
They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday emergency and are largely moving their election campaign to the Internet.
&quot;Online election campaign&quot; is what state chairwoman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green election campaigners go in search of local voters among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently cruising through the Mecklenburg lakes in a houseboat and thinks it&#39;s beautiful too.
Her impression: &quot;Election leave in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment&quot;.
B27 redevelopment: Restaurants suffer from lockdown
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
There is praise from everyone for those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5:30 in the morning and does not end until around 8:00 p.m.
&quot;They made everything pretty snappy,&quot; says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site was relocated to the south halfway through at the beginning of the week, and everything should be finished by the end of October.
The courtesy of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to setting up temporary driveways.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation in the town has eased.
Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 again from Ofterdingen.
The alternative traffic through the town seems to be decreasing.
&quot;There were some serious complaints,&quot; says Florian King, the deputy head of the main office responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstrasse, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many people were looking for shortcuts and trusted their GPS rather than the signs.
Which led to some trucks getting lost in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not observed either, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
&quot;There were significant overruns,&quot; says King, who himself made himself aware of the situation on site.
There were already two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was traveling at 77 km/h in the 30 km/h zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, things have calmed down.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don&#39;t like to be looked at.
But anyone you ask will tell you that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a drop in sales.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the &quot;end customer&quot;, i.e. produces for other companies, will hardly have any consequences from the restructuring.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a &quot;slight decline at most&quot; at the Maier car dealership, but also admits that &quot;there is of course a lack of walk-in customers&quot;.
The bars along the street have been hit the hardest.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That is already life-threatening.
Not only him, but all restaurants were &quot;hit hard&quot;.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro of sales.
He puts the drop in sales at &quot;well over 50 percent&quot;.
The road rehabilitation had &quot;thrown back his business by two years&quot;.
He had to lay off half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been laid off, politicians would have reacted differently.
Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation by pointing out that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 result in sanitation, carry.
Göhner knows of other districts where something like this was handled more generously.
Despite all the complaints, Göhner is certain that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been based here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests stop by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can&#39;t drive here, it&#39;s nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return once the renovation work is complete.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that&#39;s brutal.
Laws are constantly being tweaked in the name of fighting terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciler.
All of his proposals are &quot;politically reasonable&quot; for the coalition partner, said the interior minister when presenting his new security package.
You don&#39;t overwhelm anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
I take part in that too.
As interior minister, however, he wanted results and an &quot;attainable consensus&quot; within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed a little time to elapse before presenting his conclusions for security in the republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: It is not new that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication.
Not even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities also comes as no surprise.
In some cases, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD has so far been unable to come up with: he wants to make it a punishable offense to solicit sympathy for terrorist groups and strip jihadists with dual citizenship of their German passports.
&quot;These will be difficult points for the SPD,&quot; admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presented a few new ideas.
Some of them are tough: He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more options for detaining people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and open their social media accounts for a security check.
When it comes to toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants some people to be even worse off than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things still seem immature and leave questions unanswered.
And with some points - the unequal treatment of tolerated persons, for example - the question arises: What does that actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it&#39;s important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the attackers in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security given the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply concerned people couldn&#39;t be ignored, even during election campaigns.
Internal security has moved enormously into focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections coming up.
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the subject of internal security.
The past few days have seen a lot of tension between the two parties.
First a nasty argument about the equipment of the federal police, then about a collection of ideas on security policy by some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burqa ban and a move away from dual citizenship.
Here, too, de Maizière strives for conciliatory tones.
He doesn&#39;t think much of turning away from the one-two.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it doesn&#39;t make sense.
And he has constitutional concerns about a burqa ban.
It remains to be seen whether his own package is constitutional in every respect and whether it is actually &quot;reasonable&quot; for the coalition partner.
There&#39;s a lot in there that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to distinguish itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first cautiously signals a willingness to talk and says: &quot;The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security&quot;.
Volkswagen is still getting through unscathed.
Despite the diesel scandal, delivery figures are increasing worldwide.
But things are not going smoothly in all markets.
In the recall campaign, there is a fuss about a term.
Volkswagen is starting the second half of the year more cautiously with deliveries.
Despite the diesel affair, Europe&#39;s largest carmaker has been able to show a plus in the year to date thanks to its many brands and some well-performing markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus weighed on overall sales again, as the Dax-listed company announced.
The VW brand sold 449,100 cars worldwide in July, 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July primarily to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there was a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to &quot;changed economic conditions&quot;.
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also had a negative impact, a spokeswoman explained.
In the USA, where the emissions scandal escalated first, there is still a minus.
The Chinese market is a major support for VW.
All in all, the house brand of Lower Saxony, which was mainly affected, is still coming through the diesel scandal unscathed: After the first seven months, deliveries were only down 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to show a further increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated emissions tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars to the workshops for conversion.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars would not have any negative effects.
After the vehicles have been converted, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
After the conversion, the car manufacturer issues a &quot;guarantee-equivalent&quot; certificate to the customer, but does not speak of a &quot;guarantee&quot;, as company circles said on Friday.
Reason are legal subtleties.
The &quot;Focus&quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting took place.
&quot;VW has to fully meet the requirements of my investigation committee and the KBA.&quot;
&quot;Deviations from this will not be accepted,&quot; said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken on the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type approval will remain unchanged.
However, Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot;guarantee&quot;, as it was said in business circles.
With the broad term &quot;guarantee&quot;, Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop with engine damage six months after the conversion - and could attribute this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, too, it is important to avoid uncertainty about possible warranty regulations in the event of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal.
That&#39;s why VW doesn&#39;t use the term &quot;guarantee&quot;.
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank boss Josef Paul said on Thursday: &quot;It&#39;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or overnight accounts&quot;.
The Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and sees no sign of it: Normal savers &quot;do not have to fear paying penalty interest on their savings&quot;.
If banks store money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4 percent penalty interest.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee back from September from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in current or call money accounts.
&quot;The first 100,000 euros are free.&quot;
&quot;The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,&quot; said Paul.
For some time he has been keeping 40 million euros that could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
&quot;They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs,&quot; said the head of the bank.
&quot;I can&#39;t lay down 4,000 euros for every million.&quot;
He is now passing on the costs according to the polluter-pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: &quot;I&#39;ve already experienced four robberies, I don&#39;t want the fifth!&quot; said the bank&#39;s board of directors.
Most customers would understand and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The cooperative association of Bavaria explained: &quot;The ECB&#39;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks&quot;.
Carrying them alone is &quot;not permanently possible from a business point of view&quot;.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: &quot;We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, the competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong for that&quot;.
A banker said that at Tegernsee there is &quot;a clientele that is a little more lavishly equipped&quot;.
&quot;That can become a problem for a small bank&quot; if it guards money for free.
Founded in 1911, the Gmund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The cooperative association of Bavaria &quot;is currently not aware of any other banks that calculate reimbursement of expenses for deposits from private customers,&quot; said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, declared at the end of June: &quot;The threshold for going negative towards private customers is very, very high&quot;.
The competition is tough and there is a risk that investors will migrate to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not put up with this across the board.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comments section to pelt him with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed vinyl resurgence isn&#39;t due to a boom in millennials wanting to embrace the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely group of buyers.
It&#39;s not hording by hobbyists either - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov&#39;s results correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, holding my hands and saying something definitive like, &quot;So, let&#39;s take a closer look.&quot;
So, let&#39;s take a look.
Though the heart of Soho is losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings that once housed independent sellers - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to gauge their ages and tempers through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, believed to be in her 20s) is out for a day due to a Meet in London and browse the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector I ask?
&quot;I guess so,&quot; he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These vinyl records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn&#39;t follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a substantial number of albums and singles is as a result of his disposable income: he&#39;s now able to buy records he couldn&#39;t afford when they came out and again buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.
&quot;A lot of things I buy are from the late &#39;60s, early &#39;70s, which came out when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a bit too young to buy,&quot; he says.
He agrees that those who buy records tend to be more introverted and enjoy spending time alone, adding, &quot;I don&#39;t smoke and I don&#39;t drink very much.
This is my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and are keen to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I&#39;ve had, people have typically dumped their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again,&quot; he says.
That would explain the boom in adherents of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comforting community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and wish to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, objects that evoke happy childhood memories.
&quot;I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a form of comfort,&quot; says Wez.
It&#39;s the same for me as a collector and I think it&#39;s the same for a lot of people.
It&#39;s an easy way to keep yourself mentally engaged.
&quot;We are like their social workers!&quot; an employee flutes from a stack of records.
A poll by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record in the last month haven&#39;t listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably be looking very concerned while flipping through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noted a &quot;trophy aspect&quot; of the revival.
&quot;Someone just walked in here and said, &#39;I don&#39;t own a record player, but I&#39;d like to buy a Radiohead record to put on the shelf,&#39;&quot; he says.
This isn&#39;t a huge percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a record player.&quot;
These are younger people, not older, who are slow to get in.
Fopp, which has almost an entire floor dedicated to records, has a more diverse audience than I walk in.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the vibe is a little less chilled than the aforementioned establishments -- Wild Beast&#39;s latest synth and sex-packed pop blasts out of the speakers instead of experimental jazz -- it&#39;s good to see such diversity among customers.
Neither of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes looking at the variety of records for sale.
She&#39;s more window shopping than bulk shopping.
She doesn&#39;t earn much, so collecting records isn&#39;t really an option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It&#39;s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of records is...&quot; she drifts off with an amorous sigh.
I don&#39;t know how to explain it - it&#39;s really unique.
My final stop is a store said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
Pretending to study the denim hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall covered in records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for the average collection.
Nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure &quot;record art&quot;.
But considering that each attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers deep in Soho for more, there&#39;s nothing to complain about.
It&#39;s no surprise that a demographic that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxuries like records.
While my research found that YouGov&#39;s findings are correct, they fail to take into account, at least in Soho record stores, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don&#39;t spend their Thursday mornings browsing Berwick Street record stores and flipping through records while avoiding the stare of an eerie 30-year-old fake presenter looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the bowhead shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued the state should have the power to demolish 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp were selling goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressing services or offering tea for 50 cents (40p) or sell simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which posed a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals provided by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people running the 72 makeshift shops, but conceded that the Calais prefecture&#39;s concerns were &quot;perfectly understandable.&quot;
Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people &quot;living in extremely precarious conditions.&quot;
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the camp&#39;s Jungle Book Kids&#39; Café, which is a non-profit organization offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and an asylum counseling center for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp offers.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids&#39; Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure &quot;would be disastrous for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old.&quot;
Two aid organizations, Help Refugees and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a surge in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite the disappointment at the Olympics: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin refuses to give up.
&quot;I&#39;ll keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting,&quot; the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the Sugar Loaf.
&quot;To be honest, it&#39;s hard for me to comment on yesterday&#39;s time trial,&quot; said Martin.
He had to calmly analyze the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the World Time Trial Championships in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
&quot;I&#39;ll take a close look at everything that we&#39;ve changed lately.&quot;
&quot;This also includes my position,&quot; wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday&#39;s 54.5 km.
Olympia: tennis pro Siegemund misses the semi-finals
Laura Siegemund&#39;s triumphal march ended in the quarter-finals in Rio: the world number 32. from Metzingen missed with a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, plagued by back problems, was only able to serve through once and looked powerless compared to previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2), who was still hoping for a medal, had the chance to advance to the semi-finals.
The Australian Open winner met British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis pro to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
The last time there were two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games was in 1992.
A German duo has never been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group invests in start-up for live video game broadcasting
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend, and Microsoft wants to capitalize on that too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not say on Thursday how much money would flow into the acquisition.
Beam only launched its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give players missions and face enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports.
Facebook should help on the way to becoming a global media event.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which was previously based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as announced by Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Nothing should change for customers as a result of the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activity is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is owned by Google parent company Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany&#39;s speeders have to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested that are intended to catch speed offenders particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers from the Vitronic company in Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at black spots where it would be too dangerous for the police to carry out mobile measurements.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges that are to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure required to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted in encrypted form via a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also be used to record all vehicles across multiple lanes at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as thoroughfare bans according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, when raised, the trailer can be moved with any car with a trailer hitch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered during measurement so that the wheels disappear into the armored and, by the way, bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also being used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing the new technology: France recently ordered 100 more, after an order of 150 last year.
Great Britain take silver in Rugby 7s after Fiji Masterclass take gold
Britain&#39;s impressive performance in Rugby 7&#39;s came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji in Thursday night&#39;s final as they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji delivered a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, pushing up, line walking and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-shabby consolation prize of a silver medal - Britain&#39;s fourth that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks&#39; resounding defeat, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day, could throw them back in the finals.
But regardless, on this form, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at their best.
It could be some consolation for Britain - but probably won&#39;t - that at least one Brit will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji&#39;s head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult road behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one thing.
This defeat will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started beautifully, deflecting GB&#39;s attacks for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. it felt like walking into moving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle from Mitchell stopped man Leone Nakarawa&#39;s mountain from scoring a third goal, but it only stalled Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua landed a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play left...in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou blasted through more weak tackles from the GB team and charged to the line to score.
The conversion brought a 29-0 by the break.
It&#39;s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That&#39;s how it is.
GB made fundamental changes at half-time, closing the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton launched a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long since gone in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans chanted, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It wasn&#39;t hard to admire Fiji&#39;s playful approach.
Mata Viliame added the icing on the cake with another try in the final seconds.
The whistle blew, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked the turf, defeated.
Earlier in the day Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semifinals and Britain edged out South Africa in a close semifinal match - Britain&#39;s conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with some impressive footwork and scored an under-post goal in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England 15-aside team, secured the win - and with it the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory after coach&#39;s cancer battle
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that&#39;s saying something.
From the first stroke of the oar to the last, 220 hard heaves that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of trainer Robin Williams was all present as they rowed to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the coxless pair, the first women in British sporting history to set such a benchmark.
Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unbeaten appearance, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the grace of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn&#39;t know if he would even survive this day than his cancer was diagnosed.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don&#39;t, it will spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to start his treatment off-season in early 2014, which kept disruption to a minimum, if that is even the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would do.
This is how it begins.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but that makes it even more challenging.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a tour of duty in Afghanistan, said &quot;I&#39;ve been an emotional wreck this week. It might be a bit extreme, but it means so much.&quot;
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much work I and Helen and Robin have done.
It&#39;s been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
We would be nobody without Robin so a massive thank you goes to him. He&#39;s the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better person to train with or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn&#39;t match.
Even in the final 500 meters, as teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted &quot;Keep the process, keep the process&quot;.
It&#39;s really important not to get carried away.
We got off to a good start and at the same time we weren&#39;t looking to do anything great.
We didn&#39;t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making any decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn&#39;t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,&quot; she said.
Provided exemplary clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the &quot;Veitenstein Group&quot; water association, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered &quot;exemplary throughout Bavaria&quot;.
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
That&#39;s what it said some time ago in the original language in a contribution by Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia honored the association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered &quot;exemplary throughout Bavaria&quot;.
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for the association for 31 years, 28 of which as managing director.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, pumps around 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with around 5,500 inhabitants.
Member communities are the communities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn&#39;s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the special-purpose association in 1988.
&quot;His tasks were very diverse and they ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance work to office and organizational work, budget preparation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends,&quot; said the chairwoman.
As outstanding events she named the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the Partial replacement of water pipes.
There was no standstill and innovations were constantly being introduced because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatory speech, she praised Göller&#39;s loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He put a lot of heart and soul into his water association and he really lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was able to present the Veitenstein Group&#39;s successful concept for nitrate reduction in front of the Lower Franconia water forum.
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.
For his part, Rupert Göller praised water attendant Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He&#39;s the best water attendant and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the special-purpose association as the highlights.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the burst pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on January 3rd.
Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply from Neubrunn could also only be maintained because the elevated tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago&#39;s autism - and turns to other affected parents: &quot;You have to have the courage to talk about it.&quot;
&quot;Medicine has made great strides,&quot; the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she was going to die.
Tiago, who is now eight, has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
&quot;To give an example: if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he doesn&#39;t remember anything,&quot; said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago stems from Netrebko&#39;s association with bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship act in Bargteheide – man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday around 10:45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district), fatally injuring her.
&quot;The man called us himself and said he had shot his partner,&quot; said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator is on the run and a public search is being conducted for him.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and bald.
The police have since released a photo of him.
It&#39;s a few years old though.
The man is now bald.
The man should not be addressed directly.
Police said he could still be carrying the gun.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police speak of a &quot;relationship crime&quot;.
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the course of events or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; but she confirmed that a person had been killed.
&quot;It&#39;s a homicide.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re not saying more at the moment,&quot; said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special task force (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - ray of hope for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry will be spared additional costs in the millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsidy are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy for the existing plants for so-called self-production in the German steel industry will remain, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the &quot;Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; (WAZ, Friday edition).
&quot;I&#39;m really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.&quot;
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry is threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now an agreement in principle with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
An EEG surcharge of 20 percent only applies when the generators in the steelworks are replaced.
But even this is not collected in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany&#39;s agreement with the EU Commission on generating its own electricity.
This largely establishes the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel&#39;s successful efforts are of particular importance for the steel industry.
&quot;This is a first step with regard to our &#39;Steel is Future&#39; campaign.&quot;
&quot;More must follow.&quot;
&quot;Climate and employment targets must also be weighed up when it comes to the reform of emissions trading,&quot; explained IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and considerable price pressure.
The situation worsened last year when the world&#39;s largest producer, China, threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of flagging domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel are having an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices have tended to stagnate again.
The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual plants.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, as the steel trade association announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the volume manufactured has now fallen for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year&#39;s level.
Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects output to increase in the coming months.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, during her teacher training course she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior citizens&#39; choir.
&quot;Singing moves me - emotionally and physically,&quot; she describes.
After a rehearsal she feels balanced, happy and generally more alive, she says.
At the same time, she is doing something good for her health and spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors&#39; League.
Most seniors sing in a choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler.
By being together regularly, seniors can make and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also had this experience in her choir: &quot;Communicating and organizing, being able to rely on others and learning from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together&quot;.
Singing can be exhausting in a good way, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly challenge your lungs, you won&#39;t get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Singing is also an ideal hobby when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens&#39; Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in our free time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people brings back many memories, often linked to positive feelings from their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia can remember events that happened a long time ago.
Singing also demands a special performance from the head, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on your own voice and on a given rhythm at the same time while adapting to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.
Older people in particular who live alone practice not only concentrating on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition one gets from singing in a choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is great praise.
Singing in a choir also increases self-esteem.
Showing yourself: If I practice something for a long time, I get better and surpass myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don&#39;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don&#39;t sing alone - with 50 people singing, who can hear when a note goes wrong?
When looking for the right offer, senior citizens have various options, says Hackler.
If someone you know sings in a senior citizens&#39; choir, you can simply join them.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you would like to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don&#39;t have access to the internet, you can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than tomcats to the cries of the young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of kitten calls on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing didn&#39;t leave the males cold either - however, unlike the females, they always behaved in the same way.
Female cats can tell a kitten&#39;s level of excitement by the meowing of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who think they are in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have discovered.
Male cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always in the same way.
&quot;Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and more excited young animals are either not perceptible for the males or are not important,&quot; said biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal &quot;BMC Evolutionary Biology&quot;.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten&#39;s cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult tomcats and eight females from the animal facility of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played calls from little ones, which were taken out of the whelping box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with the screams of more aroused kittens, which were also picked up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
&quot;All the females, even those who had no offspring of their own, reacted differently to the screams,&quot; said Konerding.
They turned more quickly to the speaker when it played calls from the much more aroused kittens.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
&quot;It was a surprise that the males reacted at all,&quot; said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans.
Here, too, some studies have shown that women react more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reports the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with &quot;Gala&quot;.
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued for former football star Hakan Sükür in Turkey.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel between the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski&#39;s Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: &quot;Business as usual&quot; is the order of the day.
When the state of emergency was declared after the attempted coup in July, the government asserted that the everyday lives of ordinary people should not be affected.
But that does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the attempted coup.
It doesn&#39;t stop at football either.
The public prosecutor&#39;s office issued an arrest warrant against former star footballer Hakan Sükür.
Accordingly, Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, it actually has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared the nightly &quot;democracy vigils&quot; in public places across the country to be over on Wednesday.
Like the whole country, sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Traditionally, fans of the Besiktas workers&#39; club in particular are not among the president&#39;s friends.
But what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic historical experiences is their strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree on that - regardless of whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of the &quot;Gala&quot; cup winner, Lukas Podolski will be particularly important again.
The man from Cologne proved his sporting value last season: The 31-year-old ended his first season as his club&#39;s top scorer with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 winner.
The newspaper &quot;Fanatik&quot; applauded him: &quot;He was the best on the pitch.&quot;
He ended the season in excellent fashion and secured the trophy for his side.
Thanks to &quot;Poldi&quot;, the disappointing season for the record champions found a happy ending.
After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the &quot;Lions&quot; were also eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only enough for sixth place.
The season wasn&#39;t good.
The trophy was the only way to win anything.
&quot;We did it and that&#39;s the most important thing,&quot; said Podolski.
The year went better for champion Besiktas.
Mainly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 goals this season as the Süper Lig top scorer.
That&#39;s also the reason why fans keep hoping for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who is under contract with AC Florence and only on loan to Besiktas, announced after the attempted coup that he would not return after his EM vacation due to the political situation in the country.
&quot;If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say so,&quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot;Kicker&quot; club boss Fikret Orman.
To do this, however, the striker would have to be willing to give up around a third of his annual salary, which is estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: &quot;We can&#39;t pay his salary at Florence&quot;.
Despite doping: These athletes still have a chance of winning a medal at the Olympics in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted track and field offenders can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to make the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Efimova, who had sued for her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 meters breaststroke).
A bizarre scene presented itself: with a fake smile, she strutted into the hall and provoked with her appearance.
When it was clear that she would not win gold, the audience erupted in a storm of applause.
But there are numerous other athletes who, despite a history of doping, are taking part in the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the world number one in the 100m in 9.80 seconds and is considered Usain Bolt&#39;s greatest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month ban in 2010 after it was proven that she was taking the painkiller oxycodone.
The 29-year-old defended herself that she had severe toothache after an operation.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 world champion and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was banned for six months.
The four longest throws this year can be attributed to the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, asserted Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world so far over 200 and 400 m.
Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any other athlete has had so many medals subsequently revoked.
Tikhon lost his 2005 world title nine years later after he was found to be doping testosterone.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the European Championship title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also revoked, was returned to him due to a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS.
With 80.04 m he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favorite only tested positive in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
Evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found in the 29-year-old world champion, the suspension from the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll on Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again.
She planned her trip home for the beginning of September.
It is still unclear whether Austrian citizens will also be affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, around 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Two explosive devices went off again on Friday morning, killing another person according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
According to the police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.
Another bomb then went off in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, killing a city worker.
According to the authorities, the explosive device blew up in a flower bed in front of the coast police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several injuries.
It was said that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.
&quot;The bombings bear the same signature,&quot; Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters on Friday morning.
&quot;We assume that it is a coordinated attack.&quot;
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but they are probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb attacks by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
&quot;This is just local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces,&quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities had received intelligence information about impending attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and location.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed officers across the country to increase security around key government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they are usually not aimed at tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used by Thailand&#39;s King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and the Muslim population, non-essential travel to these provinces is discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombings were an attempt to sow chaos as the country moves towards stability, improving economic conditions and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with bringing stability and order back to the kingdom.
However, even the military has not been able to get a grip on the Muslim rebel uprising that has been smoldering in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the deadliest attack in the country&#39;s recent history.
The right-wing &quot;Identitarian Movement&quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also placed the group under surveillance.
&quot;In the &#39;Identitarian Movement&#39; we see indications of efforts against the free democratic basic order,&quot; said the head of the constitutional protection, Hans-Georg Maassen, of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Immigrants of the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That&#39;s why we&#39;re now watching the movement.
The &quot;Identitarian Movement&quot; is a group with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
She opposes &quot;multicultural madness&quot;, &quot;uncontrolled mass immigration&quot; and the &quot;loss of one&#39;s own identity through foreign infiltration&quot;.
The protection of the constitution in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the &quot;identities&quot;.
Maassen said his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the state offices.
&quot;Groups like the &#39;Identitarian Movement&#39; try to pick up their target group where it is,&quot; said the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-appropriate language, often with pop music.
That&#39;s what Islamists do as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a fussy advertisement for one&#39;s own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly susceptible to this.
This is dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts between the &quot;Identitarians&quot; and AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the party in question - in this case the AfD - changes its direction through certain people who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maassen said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that right-wing terrorist structures can exist.
There was the &#39;Old School Society&#39; group or the Freitaler group.
It is quite possible that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups will form that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maassen expressed concern that many of the attacks were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That&#39;s the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
&quot;Many people have committed crimes who previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, voted for the CDU, SPD or Left Party, who then became radicalized through right-wing extremist propaganda.&quot;
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the aquatics center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.
He just disappeared - no matter how wide the section was selected.
Habte then became a viral internet hit on social networks.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished 48 seconds behind and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming federation.
This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as &quot;Robel the Whale&quot;.
In reference to a &quot;prosperity belly&quot;, the English tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; made fun of him with &quot;Dad Bod&quot;.
His time, he only clocked a minute and almost five seconds in the 100 meter freestyle, didn&#39;t matter.
Comparisons to &quot;Eric the Eel&quot; were also drawn.
Eric Moussambani&#39;s run attracted media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
The Equatorial Guinean swimmer&#39;s performance was memorable when he competed alone in a 100-meter freestyle heat.
Moussambani was frenetically cheered on at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old woman from Geretsried left her shop around 5:30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at around 8:15 a.m., around 250 euros had disappeared from the register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the US President doesn&#39;t work out, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he wouldn&#39;t really care: &quot;Ultimately, it will either work out or I&#39;ll have a very, very nice, long vacation,&quot; said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNBC.
If it&#39;s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that&#39;s fine, Trump said.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Recently, more and more resistance has formed within his party.
Post enters the trade in electric vans
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
Other companies are obviously interested in the vehicle.
Swiss Post also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
The group intends to start trading in the van shortly.
Swiss Post also wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market from next year.
&quot;We want to start selling to third parties,&quot; said a Post spokesman on Friday.
For months, the company has been examining whether it should also sell the StreetScooter it developed itself, which is used to deliver letters and small packages, to other companies.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always inquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, the Bonn-based group intends to start mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the Post&#39;s own production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and that it was aiming for a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
&quot;We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,&quot; he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will convert the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany&#39;s streets since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not entirely surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK gave an idea that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become more insecure the longer the successes he has promised fail to materialize.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world&#39;s number five in the industry is about to make a new start in terms of personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is leaving the Supervisory Board effective September 12.
The company announced that the previous board member, Gerhard Hausruckinger, will assume leadership of the board of directors as of September 1st.
He is to officially assume the function of &quot;board spokesman&quot; until a successor for Hartmann is found.
The company cited &quot;different views&quot; on the long-term business policy as the reason for the resignations.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
It is currently still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the disappointment among the shareholders about the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago was great.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
&quot;But the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible even after 5 years,&quot; it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder becomes restless at some point.
&quot;If that were the case at BMW, the Quandts would do the same,&quot; it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company was not able to stop its loss-making in the second quarter of 2016 either.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million.
The lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation weighed on the profit in the second quarter.
The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros that became necessary in the Consumer Experience division gave the group a bottom line loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents – the bus slips in a ditch in Krummhörn: eight are injured
In an accident involving a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck, some of which was driving on the opposite lane.
The bus came off the road to the right and slid into a ditch, as reported by a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police.
&quot;Due to the location of the bus, people could not get off the bus on their own,&quot; she said.
The fire brigade freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an ambulance came to the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back to the Pewsum district of Krummhörn by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of waste water for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant will be EUR 3.44 instead of the previous EUR 2.10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach District Office, it was found that there were underfunding for these sewage systems.
The Kasendorf store is legally obliged to operate the systems to cover costs.
From October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their wallets.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems in the market town was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverage from the previous calculation period must also be compensated.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases with the fact that all three sewage plants are relatively small facilities with a very small amount of sewage, which is between 6,800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the amount of waste water in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three systems incurred extensive renovation and repair costs, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant had to be replaced due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely overhauled and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional aeration option installed in order to be able to continue to comply with water law requirements in the future .
Schmidt: &quot;In addition to these extraordinary expenses, there were the updated support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period.&quot;
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that, given the small amount of waste water produced in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot;make a big impact&quot;.
At the same time, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared major maintenance costs for the sewage systems over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the plants mentioned will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are loss-making facilities.
Bulgaria registers inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest reading (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when it posted a positive 0.2%.
Average annual inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) measured by the CPI was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, ie monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The year-to-date inflation rate (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016 compared to the previous month, prices of the following groups of consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transportation (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Clothing and footwear prices fell (2.2%); furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); Health (0.1%).
Prices remained the same as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; Communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat &quot;anime&quot; effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it&#39;s insensitive to race.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on the absurd.
You can transform into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that could be straight out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, trait-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps go public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them of the app encouraging blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested a filter to some users this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - &quot;yellowface&quot;.
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger issue the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage was widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to pay homage to anime characters, not to caricature Asians.
But to outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful stereotypes.
Others firmly dismissed the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, wrote that the filter was &quot;hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least.&quot;
She added that &quot;It&#39;s difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but rather that yellow-faced has been taken to the pejorative extreme.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company crossing these cultural trip wires.
American culture seems embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the gadgets we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat&#39;s large audience of young people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat&#39;s filters creates an image that&#39;s offensive to a user, &quot;it&#39;s a lot harder for stuff like that to go unnoticed than it used to be,&quot; 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat&#39;s hiring practices.
Criticizing the largely white, all-male leadership, Zhu ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
&quot;Either they don&#39;t have a diverse representation of people of color in their workforce to make such decisions,&quot; said the Chinese-American Zhu, &quot;or they have people of color who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable, to say something against it.&quot;
Others share their opinions, a complaint Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but the company recently hired an HR executive to focus on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts, according to a spokesman.
For her part, Zhu said she will have her Snapchat account shut down, adding, &quot;I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that&#39;s not OK.&quot;
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee finds
Military officials with the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have permitted, a congressional investigative committee said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Budget Committee, reports widespread discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how senior officials were changing their assessments of America&#39;s efforts in the fight against Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida that controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
&quot;Intelligence information, typically nodded by senior Centcom commanders, routinely painted a more positive picture of American counterterrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have permitted and was consistently more positive than analyzes by other intelligence agencies,&quot; a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
&quot;What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders,&quot; said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
Centcom&#39;s leadership failures extend to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details persistent issues in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
While it provides no direct evidence that Obama administration leaders gave orders to alter the reports, it does show, as analysts have faced pressure from their bosses, a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL to draw.
&quot;During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and testimonies before Congress were significantly more positive than true,&quot; the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military retake of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq&#39;s second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
&quot;After months of investigation, this much is clear.&quot; Republican congressman from Kansas Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after being told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State.
The report released on Thursday will be supplemented with more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations into the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday, which agreed with some of the Republican task force&#39;s conclusions.
&quot;In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly constrained process for preparing intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services,&quot; senior Democrat on the committee, House Member Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, &quot;delayed the release of intelligence reports,&quot; damaged morale among analysts, and &quot;left inordinately little room for dissent.&quot;
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House intervention among Centcom analysts regarding &quot;particular political opinion.&quot;
The preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the inspector general&#39;s investigation was ongoing.
But he also stated that &quot;experts sometimes have quite different opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome controversial discussion of these important national defense issues.&quot;
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
However, last year&#39;s allegations have raised questions about President Obama&#39;s ability to rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other troubled regions.
Criticisms over Islamic State intelligence recall a rift more than a decade ago, when Centcom analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a paper about how the then-George W. Bush administration, contrary to many analysts&#39; recommendations, used only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on Islamic State.
Last year, according to government sources, Mr. Hooker&#39;s team found that, contrary to what the government said, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group&#39;s financial position, as they put makeshift refineries into operation to Selling oil on the black market.
However, that finding was not made public, the Times reported in September.
Centcom&#39;s then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
Gen. Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA win fourth match in women&#39;s field hockey, showdown with Great Britain imminent
A day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women&#39;s field hockey team in Thursday&#39;s match against India, which the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement but Bam, 27, said she didn&#39;t recall ever doing it.
&quot;I have no idea.&quot; she said.
I&#39;m not one of those people to remember their goals.
She does know this, though: the Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and level in their group with first-place Britain, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 win over Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, and the game will decide who will take first and second place in their group of six teams.
The first place will spend a little longer avoiding the strong Dutch women who are leading the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game, the Americans have caused a surprising stir with their track record, four years after finishing bottom of 12 at the last London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
Raised in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, she first picked up a hockey stick at age three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University) and became a USA national team player at 16, the youngest in the history of the hockey team teams.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, failing to qualify for the roster.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to take a turn for the better.
&quot;A culture change, a mental change and a physical change,&quot; said Bam.
We didn&#39;t have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to completely turn things around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a close-range backhand.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly resilient, keeping the score 1-0 into the third quarter until Bam took control of the game.
She sprinted the flat ball down the left flank, then cut in and lobbed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for USA goaltender Jackie Briggs, who has had a goal in each of her previous games.
She&#39;s on a roll.
Just like Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in a good position,&quot; said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the rage of the Olympics, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever the time, it&#39;s the Olympics.
The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inescapable, a frenzied relay race between competition and pursuit.
It&#39;s as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton, passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can&#39;t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in line at the coffee shop chat without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there&#39;s Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympics and dimpled heartthrob, could well have been among those household names that air prime time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV ads if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer would be.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampolining.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and long may it reign.
But if I may humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw your attention to the trampoline&#39;s understated charm.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has received so little attention over the past 16 years that many I interviewed were unaware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a trampoline medal and until 2012 had one athlete make it to the finals.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampolining has a certain outsider charm, partly because, to the unenlightened ear, it sounds more appropriate for clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I&#39;m no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremors of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word &quot;trampoline&quot; comes from the Spanish el trampoline, which means &quot;springboard.&quot;
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, rocketing nearly 30 feet into the air and must complete a series of falling moves (spins, dives, and somersaults) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, degree of difficulty and &quot;flight time&quot;.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground in their pursuit of gold.
Not only are they chasing the finish line or the exit wall, they are also chasing another taunting target on TV: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it&#39;s enough to bring even a viewer to tears.
But it&#39;s also what I find a little tiring even while watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite from this.
Trampoline jumper vector is up.
Forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is competition here too, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, no arching into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It&#39;s as Zen as competition at the Olympics can get.
The women&#39;s qualifiers and finals will take place Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men&#39;s on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. both days.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that&#39;s likely to be overlooked in the general hubbub.
If awareness raising can only be achieved by ogling and objectifying male athletes - as US male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his gasping new fanbase.
&quot;A generation protests&quot; in Ethiopia, Long a US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have met violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in gunfire during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade it has been one of Africa&#39;s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government&#39;s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating about the protests, believed to be from last year or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks while they were being forced to do a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN agency for human rights is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
&quot;It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future,&quot; said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project leader of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries, if any, in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia&#39;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has been far from a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently cited the government&#39;s repression - opposition in the country has been curbed, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the vast wilderness.
But that could change.
&quot;When you suppress people and they have no other option but to protest, it erupts,&quot; said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All youth protested.
A generation protests.
Complaints abound, covering everything from land use to a stranglehold on the ruling coalition&#39;s power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the opposition&#39;s last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight over that jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
Several factors explain why feelings of resentment are exploding beneath the surface after years of simmering.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does on a regular basis, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxies that hide their whereabouts.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered this way to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia&#39;s predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing.
&quot;We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella,&quot; said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromos leader.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia&#39;s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think outside the box.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to process opponents and render them harmless.
&quot;The current regime lacks these basic skills,&quot; said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia&#39;s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take Mr Meles&#39; position for relatively obscure reasons.
Unlike Mr. Meles who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he is not trusted by the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia saw such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that analysts say appeared to have been botched and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, albeit fewer than in previous months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts hailed Ethiopia&#39;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in reducing poverty.
But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government&#39;s internal grudges.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-run businesses and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in an odd position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it doesn&#39;t want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
&quot;This,&quot; said Mr. Abdi, &quot;is a very thin line to walk.&quot;
Donald Trump says his claim Obama founded ISIS was &quot;sarcasm&quot;.
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to defuse the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot;founders&quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate&#39;s communication skills, whether he would be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his comrades-in-arms, who are trying to defend him during an eventful period, in the odd position of having to explain statements he may not have meant.
After making the implication at a campaign rally Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backtracked on the allegation Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really had no intention of implying that the President and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was completely serious about the allegation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump tone down the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would have none of it.
The latest storm of criticism descends on Mr. Trump as he tries to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy over falling polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on Michigan&#39;s economy this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
Taking to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton&#39;s proposals would result in higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already used sarcasm in his defense.
In late July he drew strong criticism for suggesting that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton&#39;s emails, though he later declared &quot;Of course I meant that sarcastically&quot;.
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the language boundaries in politics and then backtrack as needed.
&quot;I think one of his methods is to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they come across, and then if necessary &#39;clarify&#39; depending on how the reaction is,&quot; said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who Language of both candidates observed.
But I also think he&#39;s smart enough to keep his statements vague enough that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.
Instead of softening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone as his poll numbers have continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a wide lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a neck-and-neck race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But as he has increasingly become the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump&#39;s quips have left his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump&#39;s most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in a Thursday interview with CNN.
&quot;I believe what he is saying is legitimate political commentary,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said when asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump&#39;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in that sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called them backbenchers, totally wrong and that&#39;s why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to aggressively take control of the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday&#39;s campaign rallies in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued to attack the media, accusing them of harping on his every word and being biased against him.
He taunted the &quot;poor pathetic&quot; TV pundits who try to understand him, saying, &quot;You can&#39;t!&quot;.
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump&#39;s apology as just further evidence that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once knocked out of the market by price, Café is making a comeback in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a seedy, cash-only coffee shop in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, his Bedford Avenue storefront was pushed out by the prices.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, &quot;I know New York is change but I still can&#39;t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel gutted and Verb is now a soap shop.&quot;
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly understated vibe.
The coffee is still good too.
The Verb&#39;s new owner is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and CEO of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to fund a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu features bacon and cheese sandwiches and there are toppings like capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, instead there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
&quot;A lot of old customers have also been squeezed out by Williamsburg awards,&quot; he said.
Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer on a recent Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to reside in Williamsburg and regularly attended the Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would make the journey.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
&quot;I realized it was the coffee and the culture in Verb that I liked,&quot; she said.
Now she&#39;s drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered a blended chai tea, which is another new addition, instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since Verb&#39;s inception in 2003.
He used to go there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing over and over again.
&quot;I&#39;d show up at seven-fifteen, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they make my everything bagel with butter,&quot; he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but he sometimes alternates his everything bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudges that the soap shop took over the old shop.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe&#39;s cold-brew coffee as an ingredient.
&quot;I think we&#39;ll take a look at their offer,&quot; Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to put it out soon so his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold brew coffee.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new coffee shop opened, Whitt said that stepping inside and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
&quot;I had to smell that,&quot; he said.
The Depressing Eating of the Depression in &quot;One Hearty Meal&quot;
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt lunched in the Oval Office.
A foodie, President Roosevelt had a thing for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies like pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding for dessert.
&quot;It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who are suffering,&quot; said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, &quot;It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe&#39;s latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman&#39;s book, 97 Orchard, is about life in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, A Decent Meal, due out Tuesday from Harper Publishing, chronicles the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg&#39;s Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills eatery in the Flatiron District that&#39;s been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with diced olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple thought it was fitting for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
&quot;Rich foods were very popular,&quot; said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, meat loaf and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
&quot;It must have settled like lead in the stomach,&quot; he said.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Crews of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. &quot;A Square Meal&quot; chronicles the ways in which the country dealt with no longer being the Land of Cockaigne.
&quot;It was a time when food became a hot topic for Americans,&quot; Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole a &quot;wonderful way to recycle leftovers,&quot; noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unsavory ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the focal point of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Odd concoctions were tried, as high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t a popular lunchtime addition,&quot; says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: &quot;It was surreal.&quot;
Peanut butter and baked onions don&#39;t mix.
It was typical of many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - so fueled the country&#39;s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become &quot;household politicians&quot; and rise to the challenge of turning goo like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
&quot;A Square Meal&quot; is a celebration of historical goodies.
Particularly palatable are the accounts of the government&#39;s response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While publicly praising his kitchen&#39;s simple Iowa farmhouse fare, he ate like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
&quot;He liked continental cuisine like fish with pickle sauce,&quot; said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was delightfully out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn&#39;t encouraged him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, Ms. Roosevelt&#39;s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors resulted in the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal prepared ones.&quot;
Many of the Depression-era ways of dealing with food were discarded once the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, said Ziegelman, and how science has been applied to food.
While writing the book, the couple said they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman&#39;s mother-in-law&#39;s eating habits - like how she couldn&#39;t throw away food.
&quot;She had a real fear of food waste,&quot; Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, &quot;She actually made people sick.&quot;
Then there was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg&#39;s, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s called Prune Whip,&quot; said Ziegelman, adding that giving humble recipes a fancy name was a common ploy.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly dipped a spoon into the chewy brown goo.
Amazingly, it didn&#39;t taste bad.
Coe grabbed a second helping three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, &quot;A few chopped walnuts would help.&quot;
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the &quot;White Helmets&quot;, a civil protection group that, according to the Bild newspaper, has so far saved almost 60,000 lives.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed-out houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: In 2014, a video of the civil protection officer, showing him rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house for 11 hours, went around the world.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
However, he never saw himself as a hero, said according to Bild: &quot;For me, this is the real jihad.&quot;
&quot;If I die saving lives, I think God sees me as a martyr.&quot;
Shortly before Omar fell victim to an attack himself, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one containing chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
&quot;We are now removing the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it,&quot; quotes the picture as quoting his last words before he died.
The Assad regime&#39;s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland Shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after being examined aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic at a good 1 km/h - to this day.
Greenland sharks don&#39;t give birth until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, covering an average distance of just 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it really matters does the five-meter-long animal accelerate to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a panacea for old age.
In any case, Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
&quot;Incredible,&quot; says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this lifespan, which is a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist had suspected for a long time that Greenland sharks lived to be very old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter off Spitsbergen.
These sharks still make prey: researchers found the remains of a seal in one animal&#39;s stomach, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the Arctic Sea, looking for carcasses that stagger down from higher water levels.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic off Greenland or Svalbard between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the lens of the eye is formed before the shark is born, and the proteins it contains are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests spewed larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, the lens nucleus in the third-smallest animal, which is 220 centimeters long, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it must have celebrated its 50th birthday when it was examined in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal levels of carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, in their lens core.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.
It was known that female bowhead sharks only have offspring when they are longer than four meters.
The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals was probably on the verge of sexual maturity at 392 centimeters and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks apparently take at least a century and a half to reproduce.
That should also currently be a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such Methuselahs live primarily in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old bowhead whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in the blubber on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organisms of the animals living there often run on the back burner.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss from a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
&quot;A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible,&quot; explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Ground in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics relating to construction.
The committee was relieved to hear Mayor Robert Putz&#39;s announcement that &quot;marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin.&quot;
After the property, subdivision and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying have been submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the properties in the &quot;Straßlweg&quot; and &quot;Schönau-West&quot; residential areas (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau will appeal to young families and sprightly seniors alike.
As it was said, those who want to build can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council will probably discuss the allocation of the plots at its September meeting.
In order to be able to meet requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the land use plan, which was only created in the spring of this year, in some areas.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, for example, the commercial area already designated there will be expanded by two parcels in the direction of state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
&quot;It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote,&quot; says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW&#39;s Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets competence field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue to conduct financial transactions throughout the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been approved in Great Britain.
Large US banks are using it.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby group &quot;Frankfurt Main Finance&quot; expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
According to the IW, Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance regulator EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
&quot;The proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervisory authority,&quot; says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large funds industry, it performs worse, like Dublin, when it comes to infrastructure.
Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.
The city also scores with readily available commercial real estate.
&quot;It&#39;s not that easy to find vacant, high-quality offices in Paris,&quot; says Voigtländer.
In addition, rents for first-class commercial properties on the Seine are 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking by the management consultancy Mercer, the city is seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: &quot;With its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,&quot; concludes the IW.
Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
The balance of power also speaks for this: According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015, and 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead Receives Legal Fees in Hepatitis C Patent Litigation With Merck
A US District Judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to recover legal costs incurred in its hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in damages for infringing on two of Merck&#39;s patents related to Gilead&#39;s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a US judge found a pattern of wrongdoing by Merck, including of perjury and other unethical acts.
In filing the lawsuit Thursday, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to waiver of costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of people with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership over laboratory work involving sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drugs.
US-backed forces say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city after extracting the remaining group of fighters who are buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
&quot;The city is now under full control, but we&#39;re carrying out a cleanup,&quot; he told Reuters.
Clintons earn $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million to charities, primarily to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speaking honoraria; the former secretary of state reported earnings of $3 million from publishers Simon &amp; Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton&#39;s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, released his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency,&quot; Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump has been hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
&quot;It&#39;s your turn,&quot; Clinton&#39;s campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter in reference to the Democratic presidential nominee&#39;s release.
Michael Cohen, Trump&#39;s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audit is complete.
Trump&#39;s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already suggested that his refusal raises questions about wealth, charitable giving, business conduct and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already pounced on the issue, posting a video online on Friday in which senior Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
She also addressed the issue during a speech on Michigan&#39;s economy on Thursday.
&quot;He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades and to publish his tax returns.&quot; she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid little or no tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and accountants on Friday as saying that that may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, invited Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subject to an IRS tax audit and that Trump was &quot;scared&quot; of the voters, not the tax authorities.
Clinton&#39;s campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now reside in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 through 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons&#39; 2015 tax returns showed that they received only $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons paid $109,000 in dividends and income.

Condoms with chili powder, firecrackers support Tanzania&#39;s protection of elephants
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to discourage elephants from entering human settlements - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea years ago, has partnered with US Conservation to step up its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, a four-step non-violent method of protecting their homes and wildlife Harvest to use without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
&quot;Since we developed the...toolkit, we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming the elephants,&quot; said the CEO by Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn.
If he is not deterred, what is called a &quot;chilli cloud&quot; is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker in a condom, the end of which is twisted up to the fuse.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
A touch is usually enough to chase the elephant away.
A final option is a launcher, which shoots a laburnum firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The city council decides unanimously: No new kiosk building on the St. Goar Rhine bank
Normally, the St. Goarers accept investment projects from traders with a kiss on the hand - after all, the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
&quot;In principle, we welcome new tradespeople, but this kiosk does not fit in at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine,&quot; explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU parliamentary group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel after Israeli area code removed after &#39;Arab&#39; request - RT News
A French director of Jewish descent unleashed a media furore after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code because, according to a staff member, Arab guests &quot;requested it&quot;.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary &quot;Shoah&quot; vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel&#39;s country code.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
In 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, how is it possible that Israel was eliminated and erased?
wrote Lanzman.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
The director turned to the hotel reception for an explanation.
The answer he received there &quot;shocked him,&quot; as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the action was a &quot;deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels.&quot;
The reason behind it made the director even more angry.
&quot;The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have asked for the area code to be deleted,&quot; the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a &quot;great shame&quot;, reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this happened in Germany at this very hotel chain is an even greater shame.
That needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to &quot;draw the right conclusions,&quot; the official said.
The incident caused quite a big reaction on the internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of &quot;giving in&quot; to alleged requests from Arab guests.
&quot;Shame on you,&quot; said another post, noting that the hotel, which is on posh Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all allegations, calling the incident an &quot;accident&quot; and &quot;apologizing&quot; to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
&quot;There was never a direct order not to put Israel on the speed dial list,&quot; the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government&#39;s reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
Trouble started when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin&#39;s proposals, a little under 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protests came days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote to remove her from office.
Trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly surges to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew 70.9 percent year-on-year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have become more interested in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are cutting existing links with Iran, while new firms are poised to enter the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,&quot; Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
Notably, Russian imports to Iran surged 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The boost in trade was achieved through shipments of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,&quot; the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian mission abroad issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that last year&#39;s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,&quot; he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
&quot;Personally, I can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,&quot; he said.
Witnesses wanted: beverage market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
At gun point, three people in dark clothing, who had covered their faces, demanded cash from the employee at the drinks store and then fled, first on foot and then presumably in a silver VW Golf.
Police did not say how much money was stolen.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstrasse, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the entrance to the car park in the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of the B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45 p.m.) should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: fun and games at summer leisure
The children and young people of the socio-educational day group/social group work of the Nagold Child Protection Association spent eight beautiful and happy days with their supervisors on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
During the first week of the school holidays, the fun-loving group stayed in the quiet Hardtwäldle leisure centre.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand we went to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children&#39;s tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the diet of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and splash around.
Children and caregivers were spoiled with their favorite dishes, such as sour spaetzle, Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
Batik workshops were held, beautiful pieces of jewelry were created from pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the concluding &quot;Colorful Evening&quot;.
On the day of the journey home, the sun was shining and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The altar boys from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna pastoral unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were mastered together.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome for all altar boys, which is expected to be two years from now, the group of senior altar boys of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage hike lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and a decision was finally made in favor of the episcopal city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Gate of Mercy open at the Freiburg Minster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.
The evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out to a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb, the train took you to the starting point in Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady, and so the pilgrimage route from the cathedral began.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis stopped again and again at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song together from a specially compiled pilgrim song book.
The parish homes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and invigorating dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Guetenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter began, which was the most strenuous stretch of the route, as the 500 meters in altitude had to be descended and then climbed again in the humid heat.
The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the Gate of Mercy.
With a small impulse God was thanked here.
At the evening mass in the cathedral, the minis who had arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brit wins gold for cycling
Scotland&#39;s Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men&#39;s team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio last night as the British team retained the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took up the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to nab a win from favorites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking win four years ago while Hoy clinched their fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth place at the Track World Championships in London in March despite Hoy&#39;s retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of starter Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy&#39;s retirement created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton sought to fill.
Skinner was the man they stuck with as they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny put the team ahead and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Watching from his position as BBC pundit, Hoy caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they mounted the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow said: &quot;It&#39;s a flattering comparison.&quot;
I&#39;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
It was amazing.
There&#39;s no better way to win this.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoy in 2012, Hindes admitted he fell onto the track on purpose after a poor start.
He later retracted this statement and no objection was received from England&#39;s rivals.
With such a stunning victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: &quot;It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands.&quot;
We&#39;ve come together as a team over the past three months.
We&#39;ve come off so badly at so many world titles that to win the Olympics again was incredible.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, having won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that&#39;s a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we&#39;ve got a successful five days in the velodrome ahead of us.
With Kenny&#39;s form, it&#39;s entirely possible that he will repeat Hoy&#39;s win of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would be a haul for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on the same day) - of six gold medals and one silver medal.
That would match Hoy&#39;s.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will last for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: &quot;I&#39;m just enjoying this for now.&quot;
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your peers.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, &quot;If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted.&quot;
It was the only medal competition of the day but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the fourman four kilometer race.
They arrived at their destination in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) take place today on the second day of the competition, which will certainly be the focus of attention for Wiggins.
He had a row with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to have his height measured.
In the corresponding women&#39;s competition, which continues and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13.260.
Team GB relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a slew of medals.
After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were lowered for Rio.
Drama was playing out in the background, including technical director Shane Sutton&#39;s resignation in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirements of the likes of Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, watching the first night of competition at the Velodrome, it looks as if GB&#39;s now legendary reputation, which has peaked at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelter in doubt due to cancellation of energy contract
The future of Portland&#39;s aluminum smelter in Victoria -- and hundreds of workers&#39; jobs -- is at stake as the plant operator terminates the power supply agreement, thereby ending all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
The move follows the Victorian government&#39;s decision earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa&#39;s Portland facility are at stake.
As many as 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk if it were to close.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria&#39;s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, leading to the closure of Anglesea Power Station last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland smelter is losing money and risking closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the future of the facility, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the facility.
AGL, which supplies the major aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with minor stakes held by Chinese company CITIC and Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corp.
&quot;AGL anticipates that the Portland facility will continue to operate, which means continued physical demand for power from the smelter,&quot; the company said.
AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called &quot;hedging transactions&quot; that were scheduled to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
&quot;As such, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in FY17,&quot; the electricity supplier said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by forecasts of strong wholesale electricity price futures markets.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements by $187 million in &quot;anticipation of termination.&quot;
Alcoa said the decision to close the contracts does not affect Alcoa&#39;s &quot;ability to...operate the smelter or provide electrical power to the smelter.&quot;
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have come into effect from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it backed out of the contract.
Analysts are warning of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry&#39;s poor economic condition.
Referring to analysts&#39; statements earlier in the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as generators,&quot; he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue&#39;s September issue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of US Vogue&#39;s coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
&quot;In a room full of people I love, seeing this cover made me cry,&quot; Kendall wrote.
The cover reveal was followed by a bizarre (or just something like Keeping Up with the Kardashians?) scripted reality video that features the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (save for troublesome Rob and Caitlyn, plus the presence of everyone&#39;s favorite showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister&#39;s cover, which ends with a classic twist: they&#39;ve all planned a surprise party.
That sets up the cliched plot of almost every birthday episode of a children&#39;s show (Seacrest delivered the line, &quot;You thought we&#39;d forgotten you?,&quot; with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit in an 8 a.m. slot), but Kris had to have her other girls somehow take part in this publicity.
A new era for the Kardashians has certainly begun in anticipation of Vogue&#39;s September issue.
Kendall&#39;s big sister Kim might have beaten her for the Vogue cover (she and husband Kanye West starred on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine&#39;s September issue is in a league of its own.
The September issue is Vogue&#39;s best-selling issue of the year.
With a size more like an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the tome&#39;s 832 pages were advertising).
The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images from the magazine have leaked ahead of the official announcement.
Women who have been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more &quot;celebrities who model&quot; than &quot;models who are celebrities&quot; on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even on the slim chance that Ms. Jenner -- described by the magazine as the &quot;breakthrough model&quot; of her generation -- falls under the former category, she&#39;s in good company.
These celebrities aren&#39;t related to famous people, or reality stars, or today&#39;s teenagers who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although all of those apply to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the final cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner&#39;s success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner&#39;s place in the fashion world has always been a bit strained.
In June, former Victoria&#39;s Secret model Stephanie Seymour slammed Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid, calling them &quot;the bitches of the moment.&quot;
Those feelings flared again when the news broke with Jenner appearing on the Vogue cover.
But harping on the displeasure seems to miss the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue&#39;s September issue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She&#39;s promoting your Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures she took of Cindy Crawford&#39;s daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she can be seen on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community rights centers turn away 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country&#39;s most vulnerable are turned away from community justice centers each year as the industry braces for the impact of further funding cuts on already-stretched transactions.
Already in Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the means to pay for unjust evictions and the like - are turned away when they seek free legal advice and assistance.
Municipal legal services, already overstretched, are bracing for further cuts.
Beginning in June next year, these legal centers are scheduled to lose an additional 30 percent of their federal funding.
Queesland Community Justice Centers director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Justice Centers found thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that without the federal government overturning the order, the situation would only get worse.
&quot;Queensland&#39;s Community Justice Centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being turned away from essential services that they need,&quot; he said.
People walking out of abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through breakups, workers unfairly fired - all of these people face legal problems and this survey shows they are not able to get the help they are looking for require.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We are calling on Attorney General and Attorney General George Brandis, as well as Queensland Senators, to end these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need with legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to increase legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community justice centers and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump Campaign Charges After Employee Allegedly Pulled Gun
New York: Donald Trump&#39;s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after being told its North Carolina campaign manager pointed a gun at a staffer while they were traveling in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the state&#39;s campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that &quot;it wasn&#39;t going to happen.&quot;
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, &quot;pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and jammed the barrel into the back of Vincent&#39;s knee,&quot; Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign officials, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
&quot;Weapons don&#39;t have to be fired to do damage,&quot; Bordini stated.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that &quot;Second Amendment people&quot; - gun owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appoint judges .
Trump&#39;s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini&#39;s complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump&#39;s press secretary Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local Charlotte news station, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign staffer.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, went unanswered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before state elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), there are signs of significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could just about continue to govern in the north, this is not possible according to the opinion polls in Berlin.
In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent in the state parliament for the first time.
Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin state parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only get 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary elections (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates, in contrast to 2011, would miss out.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times the weight of an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn&#39;t feel good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The &quot;Nokia 9000 Communicator&quot; hit the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
Lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet for a few euros, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a &quot;pocket-sized office&quot;.
In fact, by the standards of the time, the new mobile phone could do a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, and the communicator could also be reached by fax.
Even websites could be accessed via an HTML browser, albeit excruciatingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna and the phone could be flipped open like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 German marks, about 1400 euros.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
In August 1996, nobody could have guessed that the Communicator would herald the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.
The Finns mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
Vendors dominate the market today, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is everyday life for many people today.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
Added to this is the thriving business of countless app providers and telecommunications groups.
An entire industry has grown up around smartphones.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market did not come until the beginning of 2007, when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easily operated via a touch screen.
Apple&#39;s triumphal march began, and the iPhone is still the company&#39;s most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, lost out.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry is struggling.
Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at their mobile phone 88 times a day.
&quot;We all have to learn to put down our smartphones,&quot; said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for human resources on the Siemens board.
Permanent availability is now considered both a curse and a blessing.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, that was Heathrow&#39;s biggest draw, just as it was back in London in 2012 when we went to great lengths to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will achieve that again by creating new opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport area.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer any question put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not individuals.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered a £11bn infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world&#39;s best airport terminal five years running, to T2, built in the middle of the two busiest catwalks in the world became.
Now they are poised to deliver a third catwalk, backed by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK and I am confident the Heathrow expansion will be one too.
It&#39;s time we channeled that Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, while safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment of which England can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the &quot;cat and mouse&quot; game of ad blocking
According to one of the software makers, for companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a &quot;game of cat and mouse&quot;.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to once again block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to tell which part of the page is an ad.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that &quot;this kind of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and its bystanders has been going on since ad-blockers were invented,&quot; and that it&#39;s possible that Facebook is coming with a new solution soon.
The fact that the world&#39;s largest social media company has joined the fray is a strong indication of how of concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook&#39;s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook&#39;s social network mobile app and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue for Facebook to consider investing in such a move worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it was updating its &quot;Ads Preferences Tool&quot; to give people more control over ads targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock&#39;s new filters were worrying because they would also block non-ad content on the site.
&quot;This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue,&quot; a Facebook spokesman said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, so we&#39;ve instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people&#39;s hands.
Woman run over in suspected suicide on Swiss autobahn
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a freeway in what was believed to be her suicide early in the morning Thursday.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark &quot;in an act of desperation&quot; and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said.
It is evident that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, police said, who are urging them and anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a &quot;logical&quot; step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will appear.
Was a collision avoidable?
That&#39;s something for the prosecutor to decide,&quot; Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - involving a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was walking on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper stated.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who responded to an 911 call -- was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot;completely extraordinary and unforeseeable situation,&quot; the judge said.
Anyone with further information about Thursday&#39;s incident near Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus&#39; past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, might have once exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus&#39;s slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still be spinning slowly.
The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to support life and protected from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
&quot;In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side to the Sun for nearly two months,&quot; GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun&#39;s heat.
The result is average temperatures several degrees cooler than Earth&#39;s today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously conjectured by planetary scientists.
Though once thought to be habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venusian climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as manager of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing insufficient participation in the team&#39;s decision-making process.
Colorados alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the decision, noting that the club will immediately start looking for a new manager.
&quot;For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,&quot; Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I&#39;ve thought long and hard over the summer of how I could improve this team, give it more depth that it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team&#39;s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
&quot;Patrick informed me about this decision today,&quot; said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was recognized as the Jack Adams Award winner for Best Coach in the League during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the past two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling five points behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Industrial disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
&quot;Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute,&quot; they said in a joint statement.
We will be holding some full-day sessions over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to re-engage with the issues.
Unions said their latest strike, the first in over 25 years, was in protest at possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent this year due to negative market pressures.
The company&#39;s rate cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to weather the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to exit its oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by Britain&#39;s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
&quot;In the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few,&quot; he said in a statement.
In 2016 less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how rotation periods are related to planet formation.
&quot;We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between a star&#39;s mass, its age and even the history of its solar system,&quot; said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech&#39;s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Formed about 125 million years ago, many stars in this star cluster are now reaching adulthood.
They are spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the stars&#39; magnetic fields, they have a dragging effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures each star&#39;s rotation rate by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, with larger stars pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
&quot;In the Pleiades &#39;ballet&#39; we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,&quot; Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as spin rates.
&quot;The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older,&quot; Rebull said.
There&#39;s still a lot ahead of us that we&#39;d like to learn more about, how, when, and why stars slow down their spin rates and hang up their &quot;dancing shoes,&quot; so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades&#39; rotation rates in three newspaper reports, forthcoming in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Alex Rodriguez&#39;s tears ran faster than the US baseball star in his best days from base to base.
After his emotional retirement announcement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey one last time on Aug. 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
&quot;I love this game and this team.&quot;
&quot;I say goodbye to both of them,&quot; said the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game entrant.
Rodriguez was voted the league&#39;s most valuable player three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature to a ten-year deal has brought him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez repaid it with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams (&quot;runs&quot;) for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he made some milestones.
Hall of Famers Hank Aaron and Willie Mays are only two other baseball players who have similar scores on key stats.
But the 41-year-old should not be included in the baseball hall of fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed &quot;A-Rod&quot; - was on the field, his appearance off the field is controversial.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to &quot;ESPN&quot; that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is the prime suspect for years of receiving performance-enhancing drugs through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
&quot;The league might even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break,&quot; said Rodriguez smugly at the time.
Even his farewell days are not without noise.
While many baseball legends are given the big stage again in their final games, Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench.
&quot;My job doesn&#39;t include a farewell tour.&quot;
&quot;My job involves trying to win every game,&quot; Yankees coach Joe Girardi etched.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had affairs with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got expressions of sympathy from fans of arch-rival Yankees the Boston Red Sox.
&quot;We want A-Rod,&quot; chanted supporters during the 9-4 loss to the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases of doping
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro became known.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter steeplechase Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil and were excluded - immediately before the start of the track and field competitions, which are already viewed critically, this news comes at an inopportune time.
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was detected in Chen last Sunday.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final, missing out on bronze by just 0.09 seconds.
Chen was scheduled to compete in the 50m freestyle heats on Friday.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter &quot;very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations,&quot; Xinhua quoted from a statement: &quot;We will work with the International Court of Arbitration for Sports and will accept the verdict.&quot;
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of Danekowa&#39;s positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
&quot;I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,&quot; it was &quot;an incredible shock,&quot; she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, &quot;the only explanation could be dietary supplements,&quot; said the athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to the BNT, the B sample is said to have been positive.
Bulgaria&#39;s Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately spoke up with criticism of the athlete.
&quot;I don&#39;t understand why the athletes don&#39;t draw the right conclusions,&quot; he said. &quot;We Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many have already been excluded.&quot;
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-prone nation are not allowed to take part in Rio.
On Friday, the case of &quot;Adrian Zielinski&quot; became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, like his brother Tomasz, tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier.
Both deny taking it, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the track and field athletes, the Danekowa case in particular is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from the start with one exception because of systematic doping, and the runner nation of Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the earlier offenses in China had also caused violent arguments between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
&quot;Sun Yang pees purple.&quot;
&quot;When I see the podium in the 200m freestyle, I want to throw up,&quot; Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
&quot;I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,&quot; he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to serve a three-month ban.
Data theft: Hackers blackmail their ransom so perfidiously
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been the victims of an attack with ransomware at least once, sometimes several times, in the past twelve months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to observations by Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on company networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom that can potentially be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
&quot;We are currently observing an alarmingly rapid evolution of malware,&quot; explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with &quot;Welt&quot;.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Initially, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has happened alarmingly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim&#39;s computer, it looks specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
The ransomware encrypts these files and permanently deletes the originals.
The software then presents the extortionist&#39;s demands.
In order to get the decryption code for the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, for companies it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production comes to a standstill.
The damage is correspondingly higher when ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of sales due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, and in one case people were in mortal danger.
In Germany, hospitals have already been the victims of attacks on several occasions, and their patients may be at acute risk from the loss of medical records.
&quot;We always tell the victims: Don&#39;t pay, you&#39;re only promoting the problem,&quot; explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to refuse the perpetrators&#39; demands when the company is at a standstill.
The hackers, in turn, know this and do everything they can to build up a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure examined the user interfaces and the contact with the extortionists and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service in order to make more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay with Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after paying a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: &quot;A single person can write ransomware in about a week.&quot;
However, it is more likely that there are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software kit.
Previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting, and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price ranging from $1,000 to $10,000.
&quot;It comes with a customization tool so you can change minor configurations, looks and branding,&quot; says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from one criminal and hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
&quot;Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread the messages,&quot; explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now well known to many companies who take better care of their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to ward off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
&quot;If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for a successful extortion, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,&quot; explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could gain control of an Internet-connected thermostat.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating system, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday use.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, appears rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, and it doesn&#39;t feel cramped anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well made and appear pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l with the backrests up and 1026 l with the backrests folded down, but there are also the &quot;Magic Seats&quot;.
It&#39;s less magical than it sounds: the rear seat cushions fold up like movie theater chairs, providing storage space that is 1.24 m from floor to ceiling.
The trunk is easy to load, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 liter diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide speed range.
However, it should do its work a little more quietly.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering could be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant &quot;Executive&quot;.
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant (works up to a speed of 32), the collision warning system and the lane departure warning system.
The collision warning is sometimes irritating because when maneuvering it evaluates many obstacles as &quot;approaching objects&quot;.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent cruise control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
If you don&#39;t want to invest that much, you can get the petrol engine from 20,000 euros and the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile car that is suitable for everyday use.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger boarding bridge
An airline is not liable for a passenger falling on the passenger boarding bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers that are typical of air traffic, argued the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff fractured his kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Case of illness: When does the organizer pay?
Sick vacationers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can be found in the hotel without a doubt.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
The vacationers attributed their illness to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip had been deficient - and sued the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only found out about this shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
According to the verdict, he did not violate his duty to provide information.
Especially since no impurities were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through contagion among themselves - is part of the general life risk.
Only 38 of 691 guests were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violent crimes committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react prudently and decisively to the threat of terrorism at the same time.
One thing is certain: our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not begrudge the terrorists this triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, that would increase security and also strengthen popular support for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented by the 2017 general election.
He also announced that the security forces would be reinforced &quot;in the mid-four-digit range over several years.&quot;
Soliciting sympathy for terrorism must again be a punishable offense.
Video surveillance is to be improved, and the weapons law is to be amended in such a way that, above all, buying weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
According to de Maizières, the much-discussed confidentiality for doctors should be maintained.
However, he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the risk to citizens can be reduced, he said with a view to mental disorders, for example.
In order to counteract the radicalization of refugees, the minister considers better social care to be necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To track criminals in special areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: &quot;The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security&quot;.
It is important that the interior minister spoke out clearly against actionism.
&quot;That was a slap in the face for the agitators in the CDU/CSU,&quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke media group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full veils to be constitutionally problematic.
You can&#39;t ban everything you oppose, and I oppose wearing the burqa.
One could talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate vigor and the ability to act with new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: &quot;Brisk slogans and a tightening of the right of residence will not bring more security to the people in this country&quot;.
Better traffic flow on the freeway feeder
It regularly builds up on the bypass - here is a picture from November.
But that is about to change: the right turn lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who get stuck in traffic jams on the surrounding road every evening during rush hour when they drive via the feeder road (A 43).
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16/17), the State Office for Road Construction will extend the right turn lane by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Strasse and the Weseler Strasse exit.
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: The traffic splits up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the federal highway 51.
The idea of the extended exit came from the CDU parliamentary group in the Münster-West district council.
The narrowing of the lane on the feeder annoys drivers, especially between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches as far as the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the Weseler Straße exit.
From here, traffic is only directed in one lane over the motorway bridge.
The second lane had to be dismantled a good eighteen months ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate heavy goods traffic in two lanes.
The responsible state office cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will last.
However, years are to be expected: Because the bridge officially has a remaining useful life of up to 2034.
For the extension of the right-turn lane, the state company deliberately chose the low-traffic time during the school holidays because obstructions are to be expected.
Traffic will be guided past the construction site in one lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play &quot;The Invisible House&quot;.
The association Nima&#39;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima&#39;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The &quot;International Class&quot; of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play &quot;The Invisible House&quot; by the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the &quot;Intercultural Journey&quot; initiated by the Nima&#39;s association, 19 schoolchildren between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of culturally integrating young people with a migration and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was still possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The Nima&#39;s Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel and the Junges Theater will be working together on a musical theater project in the coming season.
From October to December, young people between the ages of 14 and 20 with and without a refugee or migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally instructed courses in singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theater and theatrical language teaching are being planned.
The &quot;Intercultural Journey&quot; project continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to want to take part.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather threw a spanner in the works for the shooting star watchers in south-west Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to observing the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather should be good, then we will definitely see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They got their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
A good night&#39;s sleep: tips to prevent insomnia
In the evening you toss and turn, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think about sleep long before the alarm clock rings.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel their sleep is not restful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders and they can have a variety of underlying causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a difficulty falling asleep and sleeping through the night.
Many people find sleeping through the night unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German General Practitioners Association with a practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of insomnia are complex.
This can be due to organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also to medication.
It is not uncommon for the sleep disorder to be an expression of another illness.
&quot;Waking up very early is common, especially in the case of depression,&quot; says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are mutually dependent.
For example, someone who has a herniated disc can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you see a doctor about insomnia?
Weeß recommends that anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is impaired during the day should see a doctor.
The impairment can look very different: you are exhausted, tired, not enough sleep, have difficulty paying attention and concentrating, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach ache or headaches.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
That&#39;s why you should first contact your family doctor if you have problems sleeping, advises Weeß.
He or she can use examinations to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens there?
Doctors recommend examinations in the sleep laboratory, for example, in the case of snoring with breathing pauses, pathological daytime tiredness, sleepwalkers or if the cause of a difficulty sleeping through the night cannot be found, explains Fietze.
You don&#39;t really need to prepare for the exam.
You should spend the day normally.
&quot;Just please don&#39;t take a nap,&quot; says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nasal cannula, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get the problems under control?
There are quite a few parameters that you can use to improve your sleep.
Weeß lists: Regular sleeping and getting up times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that&#39;s really and not beneficial at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014 he won gold for the first time at the short course world championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his criticized ex-teammates via Facebook.
&quot;In a country where an Olympic champion gets a bonus of €20,000 and a king of the jungle €150,000, nobody should be surprised at the lack of medals,&quot; wrote the 26-year-old on Friday night on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We can&#39;t compete with countries that fund a lot and don&#39;t look very closely at the issue of doping or even practice it.
&quot;I&#39;m not saying that the controls should be discontinued here,&quot; he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first start.
That&#39;s exactly how it should be with countries.
&quot;Anyone who cannot be checked by independent WADA/FINA inspectors a certain time before WM/OS is not allowed to participate,&quot; demands the Hamburger by choice, who now runs an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators from the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed multiple pickpocketing and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civilian officers in the Düsseldorf Airport area recognized a gang that the police officers knew from previous thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several offenses since mid-July of this year and had acted together, working collaboratively and in a particularly professional manner.
The specialists of Criminal Police Office 34 can prove four crimes committed by the thieves, who had traveled to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had stolen a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, some cobblestones in between: Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn&#39;t look like it at first glance, but the police count it among the &quot;dangerous places&quot; in the city.
Walking down the street from east to west, you&#39;ll pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten, and a health food store.
Someone wrote &quot;ugly!&quot; on the facade of a gray house. sprayed.
Construction is already underway across from a Lidl, which is also due to be demolished soon: by 2017, a building with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
Articles about this &quot;trendy district&quot;, as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason for this is house number 94: it was once occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but rooms on the ground floor are still occupied and used for events.
Berlin&#39;s interior senator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly spoken out in favor of tough police action against the project since the beginning of the year, describing the area as a &quot;no-go zone&quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
According to official statements, after the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been vacated by 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled the site for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three police vans, blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from to enter the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left to cheers from sympathizers and local residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents are walking with children, people are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are chatting in front of the late afternoon tea.
A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share concerns about rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the housing projects.
It doesn&#39;t sound like a neighborhood where the majority would like police protection from left-wing vandals.
The rift that the Berlin Interior Senator and the police are opening up between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district that still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Squatting and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the neighborhood: In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were squatted, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse very close to Rigaer.
While the Mainzer was evacuated in a regular street battle with a large police presence, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and some are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners by choice from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR era and former squatters now share their neighborhood with them.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: You can recognize them by smashed windows or freshly painted facades that have been pelted with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned so often with the words &quot;left-wing autonomous violence&quot; this year.
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as bodily harm are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
The majority of criminal offenses are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in an apartment building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as acts of violence are concerned, she is reassuring: the people in 94 are her neighbors, they certainly weren&#39;t.
The famous burning cars have not existed directly in Riga for a long time.
For the trained architect, her street is not a criminal hotspot, on the contrary: &quot;Here you help each other, live together on the street and get to know each other more than anywhere else&quot;.
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Strasse - and stayed.
That&#39;s why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former vacant lots that are crowding out the old residents.
&quot;Ultimately, these are condominiums that aren&#39;t of interest to many here - people tend to live here who aren&#39;t that well off,&quot; she says.
&quot;I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction.&quot;
But what are you supposed to do if nobody ever listens to you?
Frustration sets in on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for newcomers who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the neighborhood.
Anyone moving here should be aware of this - just like someone moving to a bar district can hardly complain about the noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.
The social worker supports the administration team led by Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, the refugee aid working group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the all-rounder who has one problem above all.
That&#39;s what some had said - not so much mockingly as aiming at the large number of desired areas of responsibility - when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, a jack of all trades.
But administrative work is not her main area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it&#39;s about organization, working with the people on site and behind the scenes, and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.
She has a 50 percent position limited to three years.
&quot;It was high time,&quot; says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supported voluntary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be in Wasenstrasse
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been subsequently accepted.
The municipalities are responsible for the subsequent accommodation.
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The municipalities have to bear the costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations themselves.
Responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are vacant properties, but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment.
The search has been proving very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration cannot find any private apartments.
It hasn&#39;t worked so far, one is dependent on private apartments, says Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal housing must be upgraded, as the saying goes.
So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße.
But just apartments are not enough.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent place to stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up.
&quot;More places would be good,&quot; reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do community work - and that motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that community service will have a positive impact.
This is &quot;not occupational therapy&quot;.
However, activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Kunde.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, the administration and volunteers step in.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The length of the process is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that they cannot help anyone in Urbach, are not allowed to work and are useless will never integrate.
The clear majority are motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, &quot;people who don&#39;t work at all&quot;. The work of Deuschle and Kunde is therefore always about motivating others.
All of this is a &quot;mammoth task&quot;.
A difficult question: after the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
&quot;No,&quot; says Regine Kunde very clearly, &quot;what some may call naïve.&quot; However, she cannot and does not want to rule out a residual risk.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also an issue for the refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would bring them into complete disrepute.
&quot;They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,&quot; says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So employees and volunteers have to be on the lookout for jobs on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new wave of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
Politicians are reluctant to give a clear answer to this question.
It&#39;s actually unfair to give them to local helpers.
&quot;In Urbach we haven&#39;t gotten where we want to be yet,&quot; says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy trying to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.
There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The world political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: burglar wanted by helicopter
The police helicopter flew around different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men broke into an apartment in an apartment building on Lindenweg around 8:50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and put the fiends to flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled downtown.
The police used several patrol crews and a police helicopter to search for the suspect.
The search was unsuccessful.
The strangers may have been noticed before the crime near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police are investigating a rocker attack on a snack bar
After an attack on a snack bar in Ulm, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breaches of the peace.
Evidence and drugs were seized during house searches, the police said on Friday.
According to the police, around 20 masked men from a rocker-like group threw bottles and stones at the window of a snack bar in July.
Then they are said to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
After that they fled.
Damage of 10,000 euros was caused to the snack bar and the adjacent building.
According to the investigators, it is about a dispute in Ulm&#39;s rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
Thuringia: Zeiss Meditec has come closer to one billion in sales
High demand for medical technology in Asia boosted sales at Carl Zeiss Meditec.
In the first nine months of the financial year that began in October, group sales rose by 6.7 percent to EUR 798.6 million, as the listed company announced on Friday in Jena.
The Asian business grew disproportionately by 17.1 percent.
According to the interim balance sheet, earnings before interest and taxes increased from EUR 89.5 million to EUR 110.5 million.
The Jena-based medical technology group intends to surpass the sales mark of one billion euros in this financial year, the board of directors confirmed.
Zeiss Meditec manufactures devices and equipment for medical practices and clinics.
The company, which belongs to the optics and electronics group Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen), employs almost 3,000 people.
