"Beautiful Munich" 2018!
In the afternoon, a surprise awaits our candidates: they will not contest the romantic candlelight shoot before the MY SOLARIS alone, but alongside Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, coquetting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates deliver on the shoot with People photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot is in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Ozil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Ozil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on you getting into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the now months-long debate about the photos of Ozil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-times national player Ozil.
“I would have been delighted if Mesut Ozil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed by a certain point that this would be so," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified him also by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Ozil that he was not ready for a conversation with Germany coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, that you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13, the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire debris had to be cleared out to the absolute extent that absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery for charging at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was in the area of the largest fire intensity, according to the fire department.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What was Lindsay Lohan just driving to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") herself streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Thankfully Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, who she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and her children.
It accuses the adults of engaging in child trafficking.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to pursue the family down the street.
She is apparently trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems enough to the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan is giving a slap.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue crews have not yet penetrated into the devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla supervisory board chief
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the supervisory board, but he is allowed to remain chairman.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Tories' Party Congress
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress will focus on foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the front line former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this this Sunday - whether it is okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, sentiment in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is giving itself up as an anti-system candidate, and is thus ahead in the polls.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," development board member Peter Mertens told the industry newspaper Automobilwoche.
The jailed and suspended Audi boss Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested," he had said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in the reappraisal of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and plans to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the exhaust gas frauds became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently heads the company as acting Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the “Heilbronner Voice”.
Basically, he sees a falling demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to go to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it gets," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "strange" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the contract for the Euro 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote is at the DFB-Bundestag on 27. September 2019 on.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Executive Committee.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, is cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair of the photos of Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic are exercising this office, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear effect on society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of that," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear kick-off successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game for over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who was signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came in on 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter with 24 points on the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings excelled at the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Brunswick, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is under criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, booing calls and frightening second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a frightening second, when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, became afraid and tried to flee.
Shortly panic arose, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
New York police and musician Chris Martin, however, then calmed people off the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet, as every year.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was cheers and applause from the audience - booing calls, on the other hand, for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had advocated in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, pushing many women in front of the head.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also get together with me at any time in a lift," Flake said at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freiheit für Journalisten" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
It was about a disturbance of the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action had created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore caused personal protection to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is making the movement for the failed coup attempt on the 15th. July 2016 responsible.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests toast some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocals.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Verdict" or "Der geilste Tag".
However, the Munich trip to the far north did not get any good.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - arguably not quite serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one thing: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round eggnog, which Ina throws at half past three, also omits.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - presumably most purposeful - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed themselves over the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking is not yet known.
However, since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
Have a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled with vandalism and rubbish
The entry into the 36-kilometer-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and litter.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are barely emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished garbage cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship property railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country a more than inglorious sight.
However, members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt have also been dealing with the topic for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and local residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
This is not only often loud, but also destroys the scenes: ripped out of the ground, garbage bins demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße Hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling centre in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this sets the threshold much higher to attack on commons.
However, this would require that a police patrol will come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
The frequency of the bike path so far can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical danger spot.
There is no turn-off lane on the Haaße Hill.
In the case of busy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-sided traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Musikcontest für große and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winks in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener living long in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, explained district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other neighborhoods.
What did the copywriters find themselves connected to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his hit song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honored.
Again and again it was about the experience of togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or clues to her work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Einig with his Hiltrup hit, which impressed Franke particularly with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players make up two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only when you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, it says, from left to right read: "1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. feast."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because not the terms, but codes should be guessed here.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may have "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes are to be guessed.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encryptor therefore notes and reads out loud: "Throwing" for the cubes, "Loose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention in school and knows the window collapse there.
This is how it goes round after round, team by team.
Although one does not know the terms of the other side - but they can rhyme better with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
So the descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you have started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent topic on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you’re all about guessing and not victory points, you can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday equal twice.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the upper city of a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he molested other guests.
After he clearly alcoholically did not comply with the given expulsion by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In the sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for using license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers slammed on buffer, you could hear it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
There the brakes also squeaked and the wagons clattered.
This was pure railway.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 meters altitude.
To cope with this, train and push locomotives were used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway operator for 47 years.
The railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On the 15th In July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were demolished, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that you have not envisaged a better use of the location, also in terms of freight transport."
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On the 1. June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the shunting yard Pressig was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishap would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with kick-off success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Yulia Putintseva from Kazakhst or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian seeded number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach estate.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened in the 15th. Year their doors.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
House owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been at it since the very beginning.
As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and helped to shape flyers.
On the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will again be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them this year, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical framing.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often provided with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor can expect the "Glücksbaum" on the right side of the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, color-lightened, playfully provided with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushworks in the background, the object appears fairy-tale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to devote herself to the event for 15 years of K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31. The special exhibition can be visited in December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50. Birthday festive
1968 - this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtians also gave air to their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to put up with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the innenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated big in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, for festive clothing had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in the "House of Encounter" in rows of seats, as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controllers and asked on the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made the voice sound.
In keeping with the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Again sovereign was the choral conduction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he accomplishes." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves vocally.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3. League Women's: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The riser marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself really well right in league three.
No sign of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied.” On the contrary.
In the evening at an afterthought birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring that to the finish, a game like this can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, USC, with its routined powers, made it all clear and brought the full yield to the finish.
“We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
This doesn't break our neck.
I saw really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one does he feel confirmed: "The 3. League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball.” In the fourth division, they do not want to turn their gaze down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, it will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee steps on 14. October in Essen.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage-off with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) made her role the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur famous on the "dream ship", but on January 1, 2018 she went off for good.
The series, which made her a star, could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eye level," Keller tells Bild am Sonntag.
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
“I don’t know if he liked it so much.”
She thinks it's possible that her then husband might have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans also shied away from conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have adjusted," as she explains further.
“I have always felt that I was not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I never really was, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love too naively.”
The night moth, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little light-shy.
And the glaring glow in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseleutenplatz blinds it excessively.
But it is just a film festival, more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he snarls across the square this late Thursday night to briefly ease himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis."
This is what the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company is called, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the institutions of need on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: As is well known, the works shown come from the whole globe.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival, so as not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly binds a ribbon around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance well after midnight to live music or let DJs set rhythms, to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain bubbles up.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for this!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has misunderstood in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the upstairs homewares department, the winged one dumps an espresso-prepared cocktail called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not necessarily awarded to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting said brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But between local prominence, box office and kitchen items, a face passes by, which seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor should not be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty acting almost like a choirboy, walks through the crowd.
He is not talked about, not gaffed, you only peeled stealthily.
Especially for this reluctance, often misunderstood as uptightness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's soccer legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In a team member's 15-second clip, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division team had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute bust "devastated"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had played - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long phases not badly, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept," the ASV coach teased.
The landlords quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not initially fruit.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the backlog was only two goals.
Above all, Senden's Bester, Marius Hintze, scored again and again in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalized at 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intervened the impartials in the action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking blame from others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff conceded "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the final attack.
The boys fought great, stood well at the back against seven men and repeatedly threw on the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the completely served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
Emergency personnel dug up a road at Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the pavement and several layers were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from her whereabouts at the time.
The woman has been since the 4. disappeared November 1986.
Investigators also did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the criminal police Hof together with the public prosecutor’s office is working intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a conspicuousness under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers narrowed the spot to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his looming recall as chief executive of the multibillion-dollar firm.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled out of court a legal battle over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk is resigning from the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He may remain chief executive against it.
In the settlement, which still has to be upheld by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the U.S. federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On the 7. Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he would perhaps take the company off the stock market and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Musk later rowed back: Tesla would remain on the stock market.
After the settlement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.

Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a slur into the angle.
Record champions Manchester United are slipping ever deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United deservedly with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven matchdays only in the table midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came on to his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new front-runner.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a questioning - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide for the first time.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one point to 17 percent, the SPD gives up a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a count and only come to 27 percent.
That's the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If federal elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote together, according to Emnid.
With this, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they still received a combined 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: The AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the proportion of votes.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has dropped significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 percent) currently want the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Significant loss of popularity for Merkel was also seen in a further survey published on Saturday.
Germans are also slittuating whether Merkel should run for the CDU chairmanship again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent oppose it.
In the case of Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Note at Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic get-to-know stories - you should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place of getting to know the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the digging table or the favorite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is in the reputation of being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We took the test: How do women react, you don’t talk around the hot porridge for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Real Hollywood love story potential has it when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy then also reports to his adored at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is quite to be wished to the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For believing in the magic of analog getting to know her, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has participated in the campaign "Lids against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, referred to in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries in which the disease occurs worldwide.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccinations, as it says in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness of Mario Götze.
“We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said the Götze-friend Reus after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football Bundesliga Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sky television on Sunday night.
Football: District League: Researcher Appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine takes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard into the court with the Seine.
Wortkarg he gave himself, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, retired (inwardly) to think about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it is running smoothly again at Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only wafer-thin the ascent scraped past.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
“We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went out of the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more game share in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA in minute 41 struck dangerously in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer in front of the Wolbeck box - goal man Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards failed narrowly.
Schroer, too, came late after 58 minutes at a Thewes submission.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side once again missed a fresh cell cure.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbaumer in the 70th Minute Robin Westhues fell, there was an indirect free-kick for the hosts 18 metres in front of the guest housing.
The fouled himself competed and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right lap struck at the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71st).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th. Minute the leather in the penalty area unlucky to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Worbeck had to survive in the closing stages, before Geske had to survive in the 87. Minute from twelve meters but still had the victory hit on the push.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure their first home win.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, the accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a drama occurred at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
When landing a helicopter, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was gripped by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill on the side.
Immediately, police, rescue and firefighters were notified.
With a large number, the emergency services came to the accident site.
As a precaution, the ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called in.
Inmates only slightly injured
Thankfully, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigation.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
This means that only 8 percent of the board members were 1 as of the reporting date 1. September female, as can be seen from the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was also solely due to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the board.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they would continue to make no self-commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges with the supervisory boards: To 1. September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If you recruited as many women annually for the board of directors, a share of 40 percent would have been reached as early as 2023," the report said.
Some even make measure: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians take in 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car that they sell?
"Autopopast" and professor of economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put heavily on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in profit before interest and tax EBIT.

To the 60. Sometimes the association organizes the wine festivals, which rise every Saturday in October in the large marquee on the Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible moved under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn through the village to the festival site.
The chairman of the Tourist Board, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already packed marquee. "60 years of doing something like this - that's an insanity achievement for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically bumped into the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the beverage prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60. Wine Festival will take place on Friday, 5. October, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round a day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor's car crashes into taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by has been fatally injured.
When emergency physicians are called, they should help - preferably even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency medical vehicle with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had run over a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided at an intersection with the taxi, which was driving at Green.
The doctor's car hurled itself against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
In the process, he captured the passer-by, who still died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another summoned emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are investigating in close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor's office, who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we uncomfortable
After the embarrassing end in the League Cup, Manchester United now also lose in the 7th Round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The manner of defeat is likely to be said.
The scene in the 74 was emblematic. Minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored the 3:1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative culmination of a performance that had already been insufficient over long distances.
The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, came to a safe 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defending bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero ensured after a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer to ensure the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought his way to a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th Minute remained the only hit of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, the one in the 66th. Minute for Mohamed Salah came on the field, narrowly missing the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th. Minute with his slur.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were therefore unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also crashed from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2:0 wins.
The Gunners' fans, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to face the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, until the 81st. Minute to be patient for a success story.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed a submission from Alex Iwobi unlucky into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Ozil made sure of the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth consecutive win and are now in 5th place immediately behind great rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to make a strong impression under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row, occupying the 8th. Place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits are unlikely to let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show from next week, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital, they will be showing their new products.
Diesel no longer plays a major role.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, are likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shining scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models with them: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt-based company is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Officially presented, however, both have already been presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
Overall, this year from 4 to 14th are October more than 250 exhibitors represented.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died in the major earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the magnitude 5.9, the second had the magnitude 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, there was enormous property damage.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the casualty figures are still going up significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
But numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorbike pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral interests of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that is anything but ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the church's entrance portal.
Initially, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical background was provided by the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues-rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetically-quiet tones," says Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And also at the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and enveloped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chopping goods, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had ready-made specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasury box" and presented the older visitors to the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Actives of the Füchtorf companionship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The hometown club will also offer a day of action next year.
However, then, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth-season bust: "Crappy situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there were not much positives before at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out of there as a team," said 96-footballer professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed back: "That's obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot of action".
The further winless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, are at the bottom with two points and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36. Minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's runner-up world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse on his starting eleven debut and never to get a grip on from Hanover's defence.
The striker, who had long been battered after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was on loan from Liverpool, was also in the Frankfurter's initial formation for the first time, which began swinging.
A header from Lucas Torró (17.) for the first time caused danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in promising position at the last moment by the 96-defender around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term out-of-turn Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defended corner, Haller extended per header in front of goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came in the summer from the French second division AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storming partner Rebic, who skilfully tanked through and 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser left no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven, bringing in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageously forward, but igniting ideas remained until just before the end, when the follow-up hit was still successful.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo shot and then laid across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests only show running, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it to millions of audiences at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two punches.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on the 14th. September or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who dates from the 30-year war and is said to have shot at a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, only the altar space stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Rev. Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geising parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the closing blessing the church part of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the municipal church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will drag on until next year.
Since the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined in more detail and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more have also been determined, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plaster work is completed, before winter the natural stone work is to be started and it is still hoped to be able to complete a good half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the U.S. Army was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had gotten old and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around €4.6 million in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allows the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also commented similarly: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
"The plot in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups, on almost 1500 square meters.
Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Ahead of the day of unity, deputy SPD federal leader Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all compatriots not to come to terms with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper.
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work on average longer than the people in West Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to be smoothing the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to détene relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the animals".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply for the hosting of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the wake of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Australia?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have appeared, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, is quite different in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which was published on 1. October will be released.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the technical work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have recently not summoned the "return to factual work" mantra-like.
This may have led many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and technical work, but be it so.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself again to its mandate - governing - it should not be stopped now with terms debates.
Whether the Union and SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks, will probably already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-ridden issues are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the Skilled Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a prospect of staying for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of lane" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be disputes again among the coalition partners - and how should it be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Fighting is good.
Without a dispute, a society drawn by so diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be inflamed again for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or non-being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of life of the people in mind.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and lane change questions can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain trust.
This is what the People’s Parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Does the Minister of Labour violate the current service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant Minister of Social Affairs at the presentation two weeks ago.
In the case of list mushroom mandate Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is amazed - she now brings the matter via request to Parliament.
“I assume that the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not announce violations of current service law in front of running cameras.”
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to acquit Hartinger of any suspicion.
Police tear up a road in search of women's body
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
There is now a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, dug has been carried out on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The line is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
This was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously deployed an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow the relevant place to a few meters together with its guide in several use.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street section.
Prosecutors and the Criminal Police Department have been handling the missing persons case for more than a year.
Again and again, a bike path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of the 1. In October 2017, there were clashes between separatists and the police in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence supporters, among other things, with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally, who were in action in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
When trying to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists would have tried by force to break through the police chain, and the officers, among other things, pelted with paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set off abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the coercive administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate goalless
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only enough to a 0:0 draw.
The final light and the third last they turned out to be a gathered perplexity in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do so without worries.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire game, Gütersloh's Nick Flock drew in the 28. Minute responsible.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - possibility when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area boundary.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48. Minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just over the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball capture by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a however lax shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It made - nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91. Minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance, but even that brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut made an effort to highlight the positives: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "it all "splashed so little bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, as a spectator, you did not have the feeling that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too meager for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, is pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a bit empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because: "It's so sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
As always, organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a decent pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was actually to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not let it take away to entertain the more and more and more visitors in between.
This was so well received that at a late hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many actives with their stands, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be such a thing as a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here is something.
Then the May wreath was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative at his decuping saw.
Veneer work, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and much more he had on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality with him.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, so good the cake tasted.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors stay long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smears with local political message: No successful advertising for skate facility
In Lengerich, unknown people have campaigned in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate facility.
In several places, there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional election fair on 19. September a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message at the time had apparently been left "only" with an Edding, it could have been easily removed.
"A few days later, however, it stood there again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is particularly noted by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sports and culture, without mentioning names.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The council finally voted in favour of the fire parking lot in the majority.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was the city council.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no sign of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, the head of the air traffic control union, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on the 5th. October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staff shortage in the European air traffic control system, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and the airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," the unionist said.
Europe-wide, the market for finished trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone for monitoring the upper German airspace, around a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal, state governments, air traffic control, airlines and airports will come together on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, this will not work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federal German air traffic control.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission's guidelines for the pilot misery.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control now fully beat the operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air traffic control even further."
EU targets are currently being voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high cost of delays would initiate a rethink among airlines.
The GdF will only participate in the improvement of the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two self-employed companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and are listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reduction beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include the 50 percent stake from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is to bundle the business with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police and Catalan independence supporters.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence supporters also demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large number to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the emergency forces, however, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Relatives of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters found it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threshed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because that is a great European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile phone app has meant that the personal data of ministers and MPs from the Conservative British Tory party was temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The police of Hanover report on Sunday morning a serious traffic accident on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people have died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening together with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought-in star was also without his own goal the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good on our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early backhand by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th. minute) and hung out on the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goal-scorer, who was brought in by Real Madrid, initially laid on former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work for the goal of defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76.) after a corner per header, who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems to be becoming even more crushing.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-point lead over Naples.
The second place in the table, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the referral of the already cautioned Mario Rui (58.) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to come off the pitch after too hard adverse against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German international has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool, was in action in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, who Allegri meant with the "half-hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the Turin 2:0 win and is banned for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly whimsical appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, in reference to the late singer Prince, when he put down his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that's where it means "you,"" according to the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
This was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was just more grippy, we almost never presented him with problems.” The list of Hoetmarer bullets is correspondingly thin.
Grade two goal chances in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43. Minute could have raised Steffen Uphus, but after great forehand work by Krause, he changed his mind free standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne initially failed to score to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in the Sendenhorster keeper in the second-hand Jan Blome.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all awarded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75th).
It was only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other harshly before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Body), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to think of it," he said.
“We didn’t get access to them.” By that he probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green-whites who stood out with a collective offensive urge.
He could laugh anyway: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulled from then his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
“How we come back after the 0:2, how we hold against it over the entire season against one of the top teams in the league, that was really phenomenal.”
It is all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalscorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th Season hit in the lead (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he put over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can’t take a player like that completely out.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent enviously.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to equalise: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Strassberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Strassberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the standings had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigns
The entire presidium of second division football team Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening agreed on a joint letter from the panel of the Saxons.
There was no confirmation from the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga team.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides such great relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing is offering about 80 conferences by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Academy Director Udo Hahn, for example, when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". However, the fact that celebrities appear again and again at the Academy at Schloss Tutzing was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on the 29. September is the writer Frido Mann at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war scorns every humane idea.
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to radical change in work through digitization.
Akademie director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting on the 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon, some expect more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, others more a tendency "from the far left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we're not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner buttoned up the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar she used and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, this is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also speaks until the end of the movement, and, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously, Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, just as it matched the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the man comes if he had a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have sprung from composing Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp slides across in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let an additional thank you take away.
She had the idea to treat the duo to perform in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain chief executive at electric car maker Tesla, but must relinquish the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to pay a double-digit million-dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk’s surprise announcement from August that it plans to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in her lawsuit of providing false and misleading information.

Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third division player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
“Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many exuberant chances.
The concentration in the end left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a backlog, was at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bench of the hosts make itself decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement on the outside left, which then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again in the top group of the 3. Liga West established.
The Blue-Whites won the second division relegation VC Allbau Essen with 3:1.
“That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out that," said coach Dominik Munch after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the overthrown leader of the standings.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the two-man bar, but has not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent pitched at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. “Essen has switched the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit," Munch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still fended off four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the practice manager said to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their serves to the fact that the BSV turned the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-and-white passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner of the inauguration of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a shambles in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be painstakingly returned together," Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the TGD, told the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining Muslims' affiliation with Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "encouraged many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, it is finally folk meeting time again.
On 18. October (Thursday) at 19.30 the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly it is a year since we conducted a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting would be established so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and seaman's songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends of musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed to the first folk meeting "birthday" with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten inspired the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," reads the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively contribute is invited to participate.
Since the sought-after seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 19.30, but admission is already at 19:00.

From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated.
On the 29th In September 1893, the last founding impulses for the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he was still called different at that time: As "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district home caretaker Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were to line highways, in schools so-called industrial gardens were created.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moulws" showed how versatile the areas of responsibility of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, chairman of the district, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collecting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can with smartphone & Co. can gather a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
It used to come from the garden, for the winter it was dosted.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature endures, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," pleaded the expert for fruit and walnut trees.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and liveable.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the glaring decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they are issuing an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade deal - and is postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the fight for a reissue of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of Saturday, the Minister will not speak before the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on Nafta's renegotiation.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the US.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August on a rewrite of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants the agreement before the 1. present October to the U.S. Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the open street in early September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also on the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and misogynistic statements mobile.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore is not allowed to run.
Brazil's presidential election is on the 7th. October.
As the former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of voting reaches the absolute majority, there will be on the 28th. October a runoff election.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for agitating against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale outside Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn's outsider team dethroned the favoured defending champion USA around a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, said his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "road boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen was at the 70 in 2010. The birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II had performed.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at the compressed air hammer level
“Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger.” The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: hard rock from three bands friendly to each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and punchy interplay of the band.
Although "Encore" calls cannot be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not equal to hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special level of awareness since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in combination with the band, also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo during the even higher-performance sound than before, while running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert due to the genre: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing console team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is at the compressed air hammer level, for example, but is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" refers to on their website.
The Ahlen audience does not need a deafening 120 decibels in jet shoot volume, as is customary in the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the Republic, but the Ahlen audience does not need it at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed in the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The plane was already in the landing approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the entrance to Autobahn 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump slams Kim: 'And then we fell in love'
The fact that the US president of North Korea is quite well-meaning Kim despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has confessed to a new flame.
The tragic thing: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although in the fight for North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough chunks.
"I was tough, he too, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it's not just the conversations with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics behind it so far see little more than lip service.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim, not to everyone, is not likely to be secret to everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How awful, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, Trump explained, and then directed his index finger at the crowd: "I have always told you, it is so easy to be presidential".
But then 10,000 people out there wouldn't push into this bulging arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well visited, atmospheric and on top of that spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city center cleaned out on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July at risk of death and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably could not have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his fellow soldiers had been beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued was not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure in a wooded area in Middle Franconia for several days and nights in his car, after he had stuck the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance not far from a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after failing to return from a ride on his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense search efforts, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne's airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
“I have therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite.”
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of flight readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the owners of the castle had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan traveled after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea makes demand for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump does not tire of stressing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more soberly.
Secretary of State Ri calls for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government at the U.N. general debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapons-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The recent standstill comes from the fact that the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could force North Korea on the "knees" is "a dream of people who do not know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there have been no "appropriate reactions" from the US side, criticized the minister.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had three times decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the punitive measures at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting place, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT did not notice: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to make it alone," said Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do better either," praised one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve themselves on quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have done," emphasized Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was astonishing with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board of NRW of the Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has relinquished his post in the state association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as deputy head of the NRW panels, said Sartor of the “Welt am Sonntag”.
Too many have fallen in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa understanding for the decision of his long-time deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken by Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel does it."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, there is nothing to change," says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "Welt am Sonntag" again criticism of colleagues from other boards.
“We must not take the approach without us, the people in the city will starve to death.”
It is the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essene did not attend a congress of the Tafeln on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet cuddly," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch lose 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, meanwhile, the SGB could with a 3:0
Gladbach squanders two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke come against Mainz for their first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke have maneuvered into the offing four times in the first five league games with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf put the home equipe in the lead in the 11th minute after strong forehand work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, in the aftermath the hosts preserved the mini-pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are now re-gritting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had traded a 0:2 backlog against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came in the 2nd. Half-time still to the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was scored by Favre in the 63rd. Minute was exchanged, ensured with another doublet in the closing stages (86./94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
Against the Werder Bremen, which was already decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart team had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal, which the guests in the 68th. Minute to equalize helped.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead out of hand, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's equaliser at 1:1, Renato Steffen was in charge with his second Bundesliga goal.
In the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as well as on the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, which came from the OGC Nice, scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh competitive match.
After seven rounds, Gladbach slaps the 4th. Place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to add to his team: The 23-year-old Serb conceded yellow-red after a jersey plucker against Daniel Didavi.
Stuttgart defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game through a curious throw-in goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarter back on the victory road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already got the home team on track with foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether to change their country's name in North Macedonia.
If they do yes, the almost three-decade-simmering conflict with neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any approach of Macedonia to the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners and injured them in part severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday at around 2pm in the escape lane in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, to his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had knocked three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground shortly before in Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partially seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause," as it was said by the police.
He was taken to hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
“If we get married, it’s right.” He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the fiscal policy spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had on the 30th. June 2017 caused a stir with a speech of anger.
So he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since the 1. October 2017 can marry same-sex couples just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the citizens' association Children's House and the Society for Leprosy.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," explained the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And there have been a lot of things accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now just a shape cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedge has been sheared before.
The breakfast that always follows at work has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the World Canoe llalom
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoe Slalom Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the facility and everything was right today," said the London 2012 Olympic third.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle for joy and stretched both arms up in a confident manner - knowing full well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
Yet the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate announces the first attempted burglary of this autumn to a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
Yesterday, the Gauting police inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary of this autumn.
The fact that it remained when trying to the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators put on a hand just before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised her so much that they took flight without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: Caught up with reality: Bayern vs Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin, the FC Bayern "does not want to let itself be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dent under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munich to the bigger autumnal low.
“A week ago you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us," Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC, calling for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving way towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away, not a goal of his own, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in series without a victory, the standings in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as at the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the recently overpowering Bayern are to crack.
"Those who know Bayern know that we are not going to let ourselves be pleased and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only on the again poor handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his tenure positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
Thus, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before this season's second premier class appearance after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also confidently defeated AEK Athens with 3:0 at the start.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again," national team captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same point, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain text.
The right-back appeared in the role as a warner.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old insisted shortly before the downhill from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, Bayern were even behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken over the top again with a point.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively with a wink that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yeah, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league before.
DFB boss in firing line: Ozil-Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute topic Mesut Ozil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany for the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, the Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa at the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio".
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced with sharp words a racism against Ozil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Ozil and our Ilkay.
They marginalized them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest it that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Ozil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun through photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - you can't.
"That he has such an impression, I regret very much," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Ozil to the national team.
In addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed as a conclusion.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear effect on society and football and says: "The issue is important, we have to take care of that," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair, he wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and make an effort to make it as good as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had been driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal data, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a motorist who would have come off the road and driven against a guide post.
When asked about this, the man did not want police on the spot and subsequently drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has lost his way in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember many things.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency personnel still in operation.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the firefighting work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a spokesman, the situation continues to develop stable, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, a above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was a good week earlier on the 21st. September was declared because it had been feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk due to wind and sparks.
Thursday, it was said that an overreach of the fire to adjacent communities no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 emergency personnel tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
For the 2nd and 5. According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned again in October.
The fire had been sparked by test missiles that Airbus technicians had fired.
The smoke plume of the moor fire had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point, which will receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherines in Hamburg.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the fiscal policy spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had on the 30th. June 2017 caused a stir with a speech of anger.
So he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since the 1. October 2017 can marry same-sex couples just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state name started
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is insisted on because of its northern province of the same name, the neighbor Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked for almost three decades any rapprochement from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the starting signal for the West integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would be on 30. September turned 90 years old.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the U.S. in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to provide their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases is a card found at the decisive moment with possible donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - pro or versus organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has advocated for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head counting.
He prevailed over the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 fellow competitors.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in his air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already present two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Head counting can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented calculation competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there in early childhood head counting is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Haunting appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and stand up for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands obscure her most intimate spots.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery was launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The German government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle is shaking out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polare Kaltluft arrives at Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall line drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
Road conditions are therefore wintery on higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße).
Farmers are allowed to start annual kinking care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to begin annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state for around 200 years.
The tree and scrub chuckles, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest substitutes" and the last retreats for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: by "buckling" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a wood-rich, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in a kilometre of kink and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he stunts to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the kink care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami itself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
That's when I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have accommodated other people as well.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are partly free to walk around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know whether they are living and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came after all.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must long do without Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh, said the football Bundesliga on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián, the annual celebrations of the most prestigious European festivals conclude.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, it is possible to sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and firefighters.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to dodge the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a courageous handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard to target World Cup medal
Second place at the Olympics, biathlete Julian Eberhard was long in the stomach.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to grabs.
Seven-tenths of a second was missing on bronze at the end.
"I deliberately took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up on the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Championship cross-country trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart," he remembers with joy of his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season, he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo pace
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo pace, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the wafer-thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh because of coercion allegations.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clear up the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal, accompanied by a culture struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer uttered angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, contrary to his original announcement, Senator Jeff Flake declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described Thursday's heavy claims as "shitty," initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
This way, final doubts could be cleared up, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply at an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
They will specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, nothing more, said a government official to the “Wall Street Journal”: “They do not go on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is according to the municipality from Monday, 1. October, stationed at Gartenstraße.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coaches Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in there.
And it was a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," Schalke 04's sports board member said - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Royal Blues had still succeeded in bringing the close 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof and subject.
It could have actually been different.
After the lead through Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco security: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing", obviously more and more the head played a role with increasing playing time.
Actually, don't make a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as me on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share in it with his header: "I'm actually the worst header in the team".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase punchy and make a firework out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
The victory was important.
We can finally enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: Royal blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities were finally there, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a trembling victory," said Tedesco: "You have already felt the fear a bit".
Therefore, I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be missed.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire at about 13.30 on Sunday.
The police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out police and firefighters: An unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it had the appearance that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in the evening's orientation.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflictual topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor in answering the question.
At one table sits the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
It is therefore not decisive whether one classifies oneself politically to the right or the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
Initially rather subdued, then the discussion round starts more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is on stage, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he is talking about the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he was still an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought game in their own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new development area Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This is announced by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots of land that the municipality is completed on more favorable conditions or Prices offered - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently, the documents are being checked" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the applicant rankings for the 20 properties by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for apartment buildings with eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots in the socially acceptable model.
The two apartment buildings of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is created on the area of the Landsham-Süd new development area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of a new daycare center is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "great sport" succeeds even on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting eleven: Naldo nevertheless thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalk starting eleven, but on the bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had really talked the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalk players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1:0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone simply calls Naldo, intervened and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction to his vice-captain, who had no grudges despite his renewed reservist existence.
Probably Nildo, who was hailed as best Schalker last season, knows that he actually did not get on the siding at his coach - but for good reasons is getting a break.
A reason called "burden control."
It was not easy to tell him this
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you that quite honestly," Tedesco reported of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can breathe at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained of the rotation, which has also caught Naldo recently.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its decline in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, Austria nevertheless has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th. Month in a row below the mark of 50 meters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer dropped, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains - in the third quarter at least - growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they have not since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The sentiment barometer fell to 47.6 points from 49.3 points the previous month.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are highlighted, among other things.
Tuchel's PSG team win eighth in eighth league game
29. September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in post-match time.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) made sure of the interim 2:0.
With that, Paris also managed the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat so far at 2:3 in Liverpool this season.
