The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic relations with the world's third-largest economic nation.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a treaty on defense cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after quick motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the holding signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before turning into the bushland, where officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle, as well as a person matching the driver's description, were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police have accused a 20-year-old man of failing to pay attention to a holding signal as well as reckless driving.
He is scheduled to take on 23. September appear before the District Court in Karratha.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the indictment at a hearing by the Glasgow High Court.
He is accused of on the 7th. June 2013 to have raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire.
The indictment is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of on the 4th. May 2014 to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for the 17th November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, the middle-class jobs are dying, too," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options in discrimination on grounds of organizing unions as other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-unionized forces.
Supplementing the National Labour Law Act to create a possibility for discrimination-suspended workers to organize a trade union representation, to sue for justice in a civil court - and to receive damages or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to connect back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks faced by unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and comply with labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
Aware of the fact that the workers and their unions were taking a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize, and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, of which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other writers placed a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and to the fact that this union could then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
Since these rights came under fire in America, it is actually very wise to revisit the American ideal, according to which the working people must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, Labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and deliver on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that all Louisiana abortion clinics could force closure
A federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say it would presumably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was brought to law by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and on the 1st Sept. is to come into effect, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius around their practice.
However, the judge's decision means doctors can continue to legally perform abortions for the time being while they are applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to work in accordance with the law while seeking to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be scheduled for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying doctors thus gain more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are evading a sneaky law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairwoman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to halt the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi non-constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, consistently say that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient admissions, the Center for Reproduction Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while whose requests for patient admission rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother online, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said a woman's age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions, as well as social and economic status, also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter the distances, she proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of flown-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women more closely in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study found a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer regardless of geographic status and underscored the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause gardening centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products," according to a study by the HTA, according to a study by the HTA, reported in the Financial Times.
The report says tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homeownership spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure to pave front gardens for parking purposes and the sinking garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, where an estimated £5 billion is implemented annually in sales.
In the greater London area, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising homeownership numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 protesters have stormed the state-run television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station ceased operations for around 40 minutes, but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, around 3000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they delivered collisions with security forces equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using without violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role to ensure the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already put in a coup more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of cheating in the general election in May last year.
The protests had escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's longest-serving U.S. diplomat for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the board member of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as online magazine The Intercept, reported that those of former U.S. analyst from the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all the major countries spied on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's main intelligence service also targeted Ankara caused much more disgruntled reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Engine drivers threaten consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect the passenger traffic in NRW.
The cancellation, announced for 18 to 21 o'clock, affects all transport companies nationwide, including the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

The district chairman of the German Locomotive Drivers' Union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf Police Chief Charged with Corruption
The prosecutors on Friday presented evidence to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca for extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been taken into custody after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spain's Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned jointly with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners testified that the authorities' nepotism had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a drinking tour Fellatio.
Island authorities have since tried to stop the orderly behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub-tour organizer Carnage will jointly have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with fierce showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm that had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8pm and caused nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter made for an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell again to a high of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The gusty weather conditions have likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport at this point.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing approach and eventually set off at about 20.40.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for big networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control panels, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind it: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house without a lot, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, the following applies on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that today's world first is the e-waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in your living room today, you only say that you reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pushing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who used to be a washing machine and CD player blind, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out before him with incredibly vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office promises us.
Yeah, is it still?
What to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such curd?
Basically, for about 20 years it is mainly about the fact that we should network our house.
So that the yogurt reorders itself, so that the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives tells us that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were to get the air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will definitely come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say it loudly "Sucking!" - and at home the vacuum robot drives off.
Crazy.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring," an industry expert raves, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this is of no use because we are in traffic jams.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters, while rocket and mortar shelling on their communities fell during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school launch brought a sense of joy and expectation to communities in southern Israel drawn by rocket bullet holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident at the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Department of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were provisionally housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza heavily drawn by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and seaports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting at Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is open again soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl questions NPD prohibition proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice-President Thomas Strobl has advocated for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU Federal Vice-President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that makes me rather come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically opposed and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed at the five percent hurdle in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt for a ban of the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD leadership.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join in.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central First Reception for Refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Interior Department has set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stoke citizens' reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, leader of the Greens group in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is demanding that the Harburg district administration currently provide unused homes for housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial admission are the onslaught of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homeownerships in the Australian capital rose 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data's figures show that home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent last year, while Melbourne's figures rose by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless went on to say that with the beginning of spring, a rise would now be observed for the next few months in the properties for sale, which would subject the market "to a real test."
"If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the consistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests to posing "like a general."
The style of the university is not, according to the message.
For example, the Medau family had already been informed "in mid-June orally about the request of the university.
The statement that the plans only became known in July are definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or even decisions", but that there were "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is not talk of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to the current state, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future.
It is not parked at all, because, as with other public parking lots, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of local residents
The nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and on whose doorstep the access road to the parking deck would lead, is "not to be affected," according to the university president.
Rather, he considers that "it is not only about the crèche, but also about the residents at the junction to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
So it's about much more than about the particular interests of Mr. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the crèche, with the expansion of the road would be justified, one of the few natural spots of Coburg would be lost, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, Pötzl wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the crèche about the plans of the university last week.
Accordingly, the access road for the new parking deck should not lead as before over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but over the Medau mountain.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be expanded in two lanes over about one kilometer.
According to the projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
So far, the city has not wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 world champion shared on his Facebook page.
He is thus going into international retirement with a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the powerful back room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on a goal hunt for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will inspire my long-time teammates and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be available healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double burden does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
Emergency surgery and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got a proper grip on my blood pressure.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that I can control my head, but can't fool my body," Glandorf explained in an interview to Handball Time magazine.
For a comeback, he would only be ready in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes break, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family man explained to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, at least, I want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winners’ Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also put a brake on the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, the overall GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of 2013 is GDP compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar witnessed an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to those interested in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were delighted about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the Wall, where the start took place.
Furthermore, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayoral deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
“We’ll see you again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on the 30th. August or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-inmate, put on paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought scraps for thought scraps has the one on the 1. June 1947, Munich-based his memoirs wrote down, each chapter initiated by a suitable song lyrics.
And he is relentlessly honest: From the onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves out no human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also occupies abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom of it, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he has shaped not only the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the lifeman Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "through subtraction," as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary."
Between all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about brawls in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, during which he frontally targeted a tree.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, was working in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get moving!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already adults when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things, like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life, he was that serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stygian mazes with bursts of flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry from himself.
When I was walking around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother was doing badly towards the end of her life that we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may show up in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been co-opted by the theater.
This was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
That's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 when he was working in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1990s. “I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV for a fairly long time.”
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public eyes, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-narrative machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage law on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black," Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable with that.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-long award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the Eighties.
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought to himself, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing the time around or kicking a little bit on the spot."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought him predominantly a middle-class domain, whites in pantyhose and a cabbage in front.
So I was very scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put his head on me properly.
“That’s what it’s about, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed.""
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.""
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
“You play in a play, so stay in your role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This, too, was well received, so it is like a great shield of the gods that tell me "This is your destiny.""
He says this, of course, with a THUNDEROUS voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is scrutinized by humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gatification from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for this, you drive with it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as before.
I'm asking him if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Houthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
Access to parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi had called for the measures on Sunday night.
According to the newspaper, Houthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are calling for the government's resignation.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, bloody battles with the Yemeni army continue to take place.
Kenya registers officials to curb 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to delete "ghost employees" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement read.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving salary payments even after their departure from the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013.
In an audit earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost to payments for "ghost workers" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects salaries will continue to be paid out in accounts after a person has died or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres over the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded via the biometric registrations, it was said in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the message continued.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by establishing the actual number of civil servants and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - this is how the "ghost employees" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will take place on the 11th. November first heard in court.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil case at the Düsseldorf district court.
This was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of artworks and vintage cars and Berthold Albrecht charged higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was on school for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
Manfred Richter knows many seasoned Petershausener and Kollbacher from this time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne of his striving to see man in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
Already at the age of 14, he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse, we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
So Richter moved to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers six times a week to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the entire city to the school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954 after three years teacher training candidate the second state examination.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a free teacher position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came on the 1. November 1954 to the school in Kollbach.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
To avoid a downgrading in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into today's construction from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop at municipal costs and cellar rooms built during the expansion in 1997, although this was not eligible for school buildings according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a department of a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "This is not always possible". Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not clear.
In any case, Richter's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, they did not get a penalty work from him and were not condemned to detention.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as rector.
This moved the non-party judge after his retirement to run for the local council in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list.
But Richter was pre-elected to number six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4 RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stopovers in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots
When cyclists stop on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of resting people alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists tackled the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started by bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 tins of apple, plum, sprinkle and cheesecake, which wonderfully mouthed the capable cyclists.
"Only rural women can bake such cakes," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased at the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnastics club.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already reattached bicycle chains that have already been jumped off".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking spa house by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Even promotion boss Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour leader since the first hr4 bike ride in 2004, was only able to breathe a short breather, because he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated by means of three telephones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hesse police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia have arrived cyclists.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacities.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
Upon arrival in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening, the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive ambience and, of course, treats, such as flame cakes with a well-cooled feather whitener, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his function as a board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Citizens who were just as impressed by the good atmosphere as the large crowd of cyclists were increasingly among the guests.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media outlets report.
The police authorities did not make any immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 senior police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1. September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian Popular Front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who is visiting Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future life.
The first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud tug of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own frontline experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., whereupon she joined Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent company's top post of parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance was reportedly nearly £1 million.
Their political ranking is solid, too.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust acts in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one's own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly that calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what newly arriving chairman would risk competing, slamming in on everything, and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps putting himself to work for his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren't enough, many more are still interested in seeing the BBC downsized - power, money and status overtaken.
As the competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the UK public is buying into the world's biggest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs just 40 pence a day each of them.
And apparently the BBC is rising back up on the popularity scale: 53 per cent support it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says disparaging tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the Republican governor's official user account, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a belittling remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user account, which denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," the later message read.
Perry's employees did not promptly respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out from Perry's official user account, it was not clear who was actually operating the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavourable picture of Travis County's district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial grant from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry - who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he chats it out."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the line over the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
This one was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers requested the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the prosecution and argued that the law used to take action against the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is uncrassually diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating Texas counts of state corruption - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election conventions during his 2012 presidential nomination, Perry went into speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market 'normal' again
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England had "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to huge price rises, prompting the Bank of England to set caps on mortgage loans in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive of high-class construction firm Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since peaking in 2013," adding that this provides a "stable action environment."
The property market in London was well placed during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the cadastral office, prices in the urban area have jumped by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average selling prices at Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric surrounding a possible "manural tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which unveiled tougher lending arrangements, in the second half of the year would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday shows a drop in the mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the property market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its prediction for the rise in property prices in London for 2015 downwards to 3 per cent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volumes in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have now fallen by a quarter year after year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home of their own in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than £2.2bn.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and, as a result, forward sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than at 2007's peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent annually to 280 million. £, the turnover by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a notice Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said revenues for Berkeley were expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result at 450 million. £.
Berkeley shares stood firm at £23.96 in the afternoon in London trading.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hacker published on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker claiming to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on photo sharing page 4chan, were allegedly sourced through a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim versus the rest of the world" on Twitter, also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our home - I hope you are really satisfied with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are fake, people.
Let's fight back to the beginnings. *Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J."
They melted, so you could best describe it, they slowly disintegrated like a cardboard box that you left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
Scratchbürst knew him.
He was prickly, like in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this spikiness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the solitary boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion, who Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a humid but paradise valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were lick, in the baths there were still spiders, snails had left their mark on all the windows, believing that they all own it, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had become absent-minded in the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing messages when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer that his father had liked to listen to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their very own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolesciated, just as the word obsolesciate.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have been achieved, and how people choose the from-plate-scrubber-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a roughly-comical Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
This is what his father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game even then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure where it would end at the beginning of a tune.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed with the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were as blessed by nature with electronic talent and were taken care of with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WHAT HAD happened, WHEN IT HAPPENED—for fear of being charged with fire-stoking, for fear of even the flames would consume them next—had opened Labneh and Shisha Pipe restaurants, held mind, and became depressed with inaction.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"These aren't really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a little strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and obstructed Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly not.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse there.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be weird, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be that.
despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deckchair, knocked over the console, and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her arousal, she seemed to be shaking, like palm fronds in the storm.
“And your dickhead is exactly why I’m perversely attracted to you,” she said.
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that was evident in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was going to beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubts that it was essentially like here.
The same giant and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more grievous according to WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise her hand against a woman who refused or ridiculed to them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They first make out - making out was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - first make them out and then beat them.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the snuggling itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
She also felt leaden, but the force of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him move away - just as from an upper-floor room her companion watched him - a man, weighed down by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember once, on which she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the recently told events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, worked on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, on a brief lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected, in view of the funds and energy that were the most likely to be invested in the money and energy.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been felt despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some traits turn out to be inextricable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only does the former rawness hold rural communities as well as our urban fabrics firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and sneaky quarrels at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor, as he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Walnut lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and deny the statement.
Feminist?
Silence Again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-biased workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you describe as "devious" and "raw," could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to ride on what has happened, WHEN IT HAS HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened yesterday, means taking away from the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice That Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at their neighbor, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you are going to point out," answered Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we demonstrate to ourselves.
My concern lies in the fact that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only happened to WHAT HAPPENED IN the first place when IT HAS happened.
This time, however, it is not the others on which we vent our anger and suspicion.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you refer to actions as "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you talk about these venting their "anger" and their "mistrust" of "others."
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not talking about "us" and "others" in understanding the past as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt must be assigned, there is no need to repay any debt if such a repayment were appropriate and if there was a way to erase it.
But to what serves the past if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to forget it.
If I may say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven onto the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied having planned a coup to overthrow the government and said they were cracking down on police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting of assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'etat, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armament by the police was imminent.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were acting within the police, which actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had given the impression of a coup.
"Even though no one has claimed to have seized the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Spokesmen for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the governance during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believed he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been huge tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite other recriminations.
Production in the eurozone at a 13-month low
The rise in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point of the past 13 months, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit Purchasing Managers' Index of the manufacturing sector (PMI) fell to 50.7 in in August, down from a level of 51.8 in in July.
A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced slumps at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to adopt a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant eurozone recovery, as well as for the looming deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details later this week on whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the curbing impact of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties has become more pronounced for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
Factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI dropped to 46.9.
France remains a worrying child, as does Italy's relegation from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives are no longer taking effect in the key industry mechanism Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in the industry is presumably fuelling the fire of analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the August manufacturing purchasing managers' index in the eurozone is that after that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These heightened uncertainties have quite clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and is believed to have some orders delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it was becoming "ever more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The hellish decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on the 1. In September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, that seemed like the most evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom at the atrocity.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, though the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now haunts Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shot school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitry Beliakov when she tried to climb back to the shot school sports hall only in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
They were both thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to have surgery again.
Some shrapnel are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says, fun of a fight.
“That’s what happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory will become a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of myself climbing back to school, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help make sure something like this doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, seizing it by the hand and fleeing through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son outside in his arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and who didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd love to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me at the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood have been killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London were crying when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in those 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just those children like ours.
I think that for many, the war is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends out of class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes laying down on the sofa, facing away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-splattered face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie managed to survive.
The closer this date approaches, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days are always haunting me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
Urgent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij so much wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in our home on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It's important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People repeatedly investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how that’s possible, because when you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing like this pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1. September is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attended a medical school in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgi Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after siege on laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations for remembrance.
I know that Georgiy will not go.
It has to be a lot more fierce for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God for being given back to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is drawn by it.
It's staying in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has undergone surgery on several occasions, he can walk, but not play sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome that and forget that.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only increased my pain.
I have lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart is crying for those killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also from widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I almost can't believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more are killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special operations squad
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian special operations commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the cruelties at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, which he named after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, doesn't remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They're a big happy family now and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the 10th anniversary.

Man accused of run over girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the accusation before Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimize exposure time for the dusky underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at this underwater, and the correct image setting is a matter of luck.
So you take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Walk close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the low light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you have to close to your objects if you want them to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As an advisory anesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to the doctors, while the treated are predominantly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed he impatiently blamed his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather have everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and troubled for no reason.
There was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast fur, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers used to be smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber-based fibrous building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can ignore as easily.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still deployed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesotheliome deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all asbestos types were banned) is that a mesothelioma does not develop until decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The parliament buildings are asbestos-infested.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to become healthy, have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
He was indeed having a hard time imagining where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital, and those who have contracted mesothelioma for the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last to be alive."
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he was on the 17th. This year's February died, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomere patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are going to fall ill?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestesp epidemic is expected to come to a halt in the UK, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which those affected often turn because of claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her 20s.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform," a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "major health risk" with possible death.
However, the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure by work or in the home presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
According to him, much of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people might have been unwittingly exposed to the fabric even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are frequently accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MPs are arguably more likely to meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than the West.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers exactly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and was performing an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the ride home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain stemmed from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Astonished doctors took X-rays of his breast and put on pleural cathethers to remove fluid from the lungs and test them in the laboratory.
However, his complaints were left without a diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his GP brought his CT scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cave between the rib and the perit.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Frankly, I hadn't worried that much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him take a lawyer.
It was only now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolations in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It shows that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening to the attending physicians.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it doesn't just affect hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes, such as floor slabs or scale roofs have included asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison that's included in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and knowing that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realised I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very hard to take in all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long have I been?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it.""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the toraccoa, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pectoral fur and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," according to Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thoracic doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital Andrew Lawson suspects it has exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also believed to have been exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers don't work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly contested.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the pectoral fur," he says.
They can't get around it with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't respond very well on chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but doesn't heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he introduced himself cheerfully during calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that last four months and would likely extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was going to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to treat Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorace specialist at Guy's to continue.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred further, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and would have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail eventually, many sufferers stand by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low burden was a health risk.
And this is where the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full-fledged compensation," as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, following the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but most certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012, can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In those cases, the plaintiffs get 80 per cent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million represented a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"That's a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, indicating that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't gone over it and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and they could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then-Labour and Pensions Secretary at the time, also admitted the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that quick action was needed on a daily basis, given seven deaths.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At that point, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof for 19 months. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After her initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's obviously the most important thing," Abbott says.
You can see this again and again in patients.
There's something there that's gonna keep you going.
When you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer patches around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumors visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler time setting works.
When you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I would not get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomere sufferers, such conversations are not permeated with hope, not a trail of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as ultimately also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retribution
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms.
This approach probably fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated the planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing-aligned candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that admitting public nominations in elections to the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents vote for the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the process firmly in hand through a closely controlled nomination committee by a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most audience-driven protests in Hong Kong have taken place in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to foreclose the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that is only to take place when all the dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing's announcement, and tightened security measures, including police forces and barricades, were in place on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is compounded by the sentiment of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement's demonstrations as it jeopardized business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they're talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved in it and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong's democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights, which was attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school-leg balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to universities, where freshmen appearances are offered by private plane.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also said it expects a market for this offer despite tuition of £9,000 a year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis in the cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student dorm.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
While tensions in the Midwest rose and received attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved 100% around the breed.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9. August came the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts on Ferguson of a White Woman" and "Feminism isn't just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you find a lot of people in feminism who are talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pushed to express something about the incidents.
It's characteristic of the crisis we find ourselves in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but who are not considered "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public spaces?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now link the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white female fighters for women's suffrage like Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th Century analyzed and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why women of color do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?” asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproduction rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means.
Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, posting a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian's columnist, in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the racial issue in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the issue as an essential women's issue, she merely had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig who had betted his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly released and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique single-family home with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The home sale caused interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwestern Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to come forward.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit was causing talk in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made the mega profit of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the opportunity of a trip around the world and buying a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59. Winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked to the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman day in the theme park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men one after the other into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular shield and short sword, as well as leg splint on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and throwing rim as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which competed with throwing net, trident and dagger against the "Secutor" and after a short fight the boys to the ground.
Then the swords crashed metallically, the shields slammed and the throwing rots flew surgingly through the arena, that one could become afraid and anxious for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the everyday life of the Roman period and make the culture of the Roman period tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, for one day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this could also be admired at Roman Day, such as "Aqueduct Marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now contrasted the water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time today".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveyor Ralph Heiligener from the "Engineering TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints that had been left by Wolf and Fuchs in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Conservation of Land Monuments at the Landesverband Rheinland unearthed the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
They had found enclosure walls of a farm building with a darre for drying grain and for malting.
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tablets like the Roman students once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach glass museum and serve a heavy stone wheat mill at the Eifel Nettersheim stand to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the Roman touring car, which was faithfully reproduced by two cold-blooded animals, the visitors drove through the theme park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21. September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Rhineland-wide proclaimed Roman year 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and the Roman past of Wachtberg are remembered.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the trainy Wachtberg, plants will be presented as living monuments from the Roman period and a witty lesson in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans will be presented.
The Adendorf Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible at first glance traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made tangible again.
In the Wachtberg town hall, a small presentation will commemorate the find of the Berkum Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic weighs on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are going at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealing a major blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets orphaned - the virus has severely affected the region.
Some international companies are already a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," said Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more have become infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are suspending their operations everywhere in the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are pulling off their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants still leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, rot in the fields, among other things.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People are going to travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the stockpile of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is in danger of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What is important is how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors can get the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also weighs on the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also weighs on the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
Credit rating agency Moody's fears their budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health care system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help out the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Shooters celebrate their 50. Anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates from 12 to 14. September his 50th anniversary of founding.
Preparations for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 are in full swing at the Schützenverein Tannenwald. September.
Scheduled for Friday, 12. September, a big entertainment evening with the group "village rocker."
Saturday is at 6 p.m. the big firecracker shooting.
Afterwards, in the large marquee is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the distribution of the federal and Gau shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have assumed the patronage.
The original designation "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when it was 21. March the association for "social entertainment by means of practice in room fittings and small caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who were 30. April in the inn Lukas the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau has launched.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting champions through a difficult early day, in which it was mainly about finding a club premises and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1. Gauliga.
The club records slumped every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours granted on the 8th May 1988 Pastor Strasser for the new shooting rooms the church blessing.
One of the big highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44. Gauschießen, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24. In April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A firecracker group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a firecracker consultant.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the hosting of the Bavarian Firecracker Meeting 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1. Team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the round 2013/14.
The 2. Team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as buck stinging, carnival and king ball, club outing and Christmas party have a tradition.
The shooters are also involved in the festivals in the parish and the parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart raced against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst into lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team principal, Chad Johnston, said his 14-strong team was disappointed but now focused on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went into a good result today with pretty good hopes," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart dropped out three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at a Cinderman race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race at Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. is being investigated. This one had stepped onto the carriageway during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart must face an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12. Position, Stewart had already advanced into the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs got
Car with the number. 18 out of control after the exit from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both carriages driving against the wall.
Stewart continued to drive but dropped back to 21st.
Looking for dance-loving youngsters
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to fellow competitors.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn are also making all-day lessons at secondary schools to create.
After the summer holidays, some groups have severely decimated.
Now, more and more young talent is being sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," only nine children remain.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old recounted.
With more actives, the whole thing would be significantly more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can get a taste of the training session on Thursdays between 17 and 18:00 or on Fridays between 17 and 18:30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not neglected either.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance movies and we've stayed in the dance room before," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not like that, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always get a taste of the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop in the classroom.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you fancy Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can stop by and join.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from across Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest outside the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting for a month against the new working hours, demanding a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR).
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The prison staff's protest is expected to be supported by members of the Union Association of Employees of the Interior Ministry.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tank battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a warplane and two military helicopters, according to their own account.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coast guard boats for the first time in the Sea of Azov.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were believed to be missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several localities in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO won't break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a stark breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show that they consider us as opponents.
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it intends to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still awaiting whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also disrupt gas supplies for Europe.
Europe draws around a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: Toll will come "quite clear"
Now the Chancellor is once again clearly committed to this.
However, it is not a free pass for all complicated details.
Stubborn concerns from the CDU against the car toll have been increasingly solmed by the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To be very clear: she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top bodies in Berlin.
For the time being, Merkel did not commit to a detailed model.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and this is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house was examining its own concept to remunerate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU federal deputy Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to be toll all county and federal roads," the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU state chairman said.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk again about the issue.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded because of the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU coalition loyalty.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (Monday).
“With the toll, the minister fails.” Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette requirement on all German roads, which is scheduled to launch in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners must not be burdened additionally.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Brit says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she was going to die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to be suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was going to be in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and before her 30th. Birthday die.
The mother of two children, who is 51 today, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboarding with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretching her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and slowly lose all my abilities in between.
I made all this up with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up, and hugged me and said, "my dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Staff sergeant a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes across the heart of the biosphere area during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare site has been the centrepiece of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Government and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the Washington-based firms were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area collectively paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of falling notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more sharply than local levies, down 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenues, 56 percent, come from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the property values of the companies, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large portion of these gains came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in increasing government and local tax revenues in Maryland, as property taxes here amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, the following happens: a large portion of the properties, particularly in the D.C. tax area, are either owned by the government or of nonprofits that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses is not rising evenly in all three places.
The rate of rise in the District was 4.3 percent in line with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes, at 6 percent in all three offices (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate prevails overall than in Maryland.
The district was not examined in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to cut its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, that law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general multi-defense tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cut impacts the job market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination even in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, said this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again, the functionary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li advertised.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would look around in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already radiates this joie de vivre, he flattered the host.
As a result, the functionary from Guangzhou toasted with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice Party leader Li said.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician expressed confidence.
“The business traffic between our two cities continues to increase.”
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-maintained partnership
Guangzhou's pedignist party chief hopes he can attend Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been forced out of office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption, which is being enforced with harshness by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a top official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those that is maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family 'crosses their fingers'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter today expressed hope that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that are on sale from today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1. September on a label on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, stricter nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: They receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion-decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, had launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravura pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which Besserwisser give the (mostly older) games a coat of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't come about, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watch it, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spunner get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the viewing perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs into which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn't a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic spikes.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: thousands of young men being courted as advertisers.
As Twitch's chairman, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy downpour on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors set out for the open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedeler, but also guests from the near and far surroundings, had made themselves comfortable around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, rocked their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were trendy.
And that across the generations.
While some were lying on blankets on the extra-carted white sand at the beach bar, others feasted on a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But even with children's make-up, the volunteers literally had their hands full to do to master the crowd and conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The older ones used the foosball tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel hosted.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 he came down on the visitors, especially families sought the vastness and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop it.
"There were more people coming than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board."
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a repeat of the big party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the popular voice.
He described as annoying that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the premises.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their performance unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned hookah lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a puncture.
"But they will be there next year," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful in the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
The organizers also have to take criticism on the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don't see the initial problems quite as narrowly.
I think it’s very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organizers have a year to put off these criticisms.
New radome in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-be-ready component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
The new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
However, size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old shell is severed and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
If the weather is playing along, the action should be at the beginning of this week.
Participants in the Ice Bucket Challenge dislocated jaw
Isabelle Roberts of the UK screamed so much as her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went painfully offside.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shrieked so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost made their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalised to get her jaws back in after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull together again?
Recently, there was always conflict between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
Now the board members are considering possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
Just a year ago, there was not a good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the viewpoints on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction have seemed to be extremely different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: Talks on a joint approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the club board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
Thus, more quickly visible successes can be seen.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until recently a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront for the castle association around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been head of the castle friends.
A new chairman is due to be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
“After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club activities rest out of respect.” This "thinking phase" was needed to "consider how it could proceed."
According to Piffl, the new chairman is then to go into the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
“But I’m confident someone will find themselves.” He himself does not want to run because he is a resident in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much like to continue working on the project".
The different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He pays tribute to Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to a high participation of the population and through volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I, too, was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward.” A "unique selling point" for the rafting city could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financeable through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
“I personally don’t want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard.” He hopes that the castle club may move a bit on this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first "is important and good."
After that, you could see further.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said students spend on average more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study material, but that there were different cost-cutting options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said renting text books had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented last spring semester, Neebo's vice president, Tevor Meyer, said.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online just a third of the price they are available for in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be sourced from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal signs of wear, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduation student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com on a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors whether previous editions were permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to give them back, and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
A student, for example, could rent "Calculus" for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out about the terms of the business you are renting at, including the penalty fees that may apply to write notes, underline or traces of use.
Tenants beware: If you don't return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, one should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a box office hit
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone grossed less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed just $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-specific film "Sex Tape" grossed just $14.6 million over the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon's Tame Made Easy 2" also disappoint in revenues.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin hints that in the children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films, describing "Dragon Taming Made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
With movies for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the movies is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launch, the one between American Memorial Day and the 20th. July 2013 and in the current year was shown on at least 2000 canvases.
The results draw on the opinion of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of the past year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-release Jungle Book film, told website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to accept that and not try to run after the past.
Unlike the currently weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues of the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost double the amount of last year, in which revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on film adaptations of comics and predicting a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men's producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2. Table tennis district class has been cancelled for the purpose of tightening the league classification, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has an additional 3. Bundesliga included in the program.
The consequence: Those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen’s highest-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided relegation, but will only play fifth-class next season.
Fourth-class remain torpedoes ladies, despite their grandiose march through to the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo reserve compete in the new association league, in the Landesliga no more Göttingen clubs are represented.
In the women's race, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class of the composition is now the new district upper league South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC will compete here.
In the district league, Dransfeld and the SC Weende allude to the district class of the TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies begins at least in target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league squad of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II still starts - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the Ost-Staffel.
The women's district league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six 2.circle classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and bustling circular board will have to think about.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport over the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in central Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments for us at the weekend and spoke with protesters who have travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bush swanders were taken to safety with the winch after being caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW the night.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday lunchtime in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called police at about 8pm when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services broke up and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 2pm.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out Monday morning.
They were admitted to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The roughly 1000 protesters had been pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The broadcaster resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters, equipped with sticks, had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
The dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said around a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had resumed on Monday to clashes between around 3000 protesters and security forces.
According to hospital data, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting at the army headquarters, "without wasting time and without using force."
“The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has stoked concern about military intervention, which has already put in a coup more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on 14. August on.
Sharif opposes a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to persevere on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed similar sentiments.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning May's general election through fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially persevered peacefully outside parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after a second win of the season in third place in the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The win is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green-and-white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on the winning road Rapid with the second victory of the season has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the international break with a sense of success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said full-back Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th. Minute set the course for victory.
"I thought I'd hit all the frustration from Thursday and snatched him under the bar," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
As Schrammel on the 13th Novmember had met for the last time in a Bundesliga game in 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there as well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror-inverted manner.
He deserves the goal, he has already done some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 through Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written too.
"Thank God we had some luck today," remarked Schrammel, who alluded to the gaping of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results were not right, but the play was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that "in many games before, you have been better than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less pleasing for him: "That we finally played to zero again".
The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures have to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting eleven debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," warned Barisic, who lost players over the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and get a bit in the physical area," explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One who is particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself up for the team, goes over pain.
Especially at this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game to Rapids before his substitution in the 68th. Minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who is his 350th Bundesliga game played, it was the first hit out of the game since 2. November 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Can't believe that everything is good now" "We certainly have had a bit of luck, but at some point luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He warned, of course, to concentrated further work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as that has been portrayed.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot right now.
They stick to me in certain phases," Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the quick hit "from the magic goal category," as well as Nutz's regular goal in the 40th. Minute, which had been wrongly revoked by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We have had too few degrees.
Central defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found in and even made a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Under this top there is calm
We showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geissruheriche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes by paddocks, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and is reminiscent of an American sequoia tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only references to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to learn what kind of knowledge it has with the cheess.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Until about 80 years ago, the goat herders drove their animals from Unterweißenbrunn onto the arduously cleared meadows and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guardians exhausted from the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds actually graze again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, one should exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for cross otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, climb up the direction Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle that is being sought in our next task is rarely found at altitude.
The reflection in the moat already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district, to which the building portrait could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück"?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's prime minister and acting EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, has pushed through the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, she will succeed Britain's Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reproves, considers the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also considered the favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost from this for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the left-wing party base, which repeatedly rebels against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit rather in a moderate way.
Compared to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish nominated as President of the Council Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, will be established in a political balance.
The EU’s chief diplomat will also be deputy to the President of the Commission, Juncker.
The remaining approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for its ambition, will face the "enormous challenges".
The Roman-born woman is married and has two daughters.
The political scientist with a doctorate began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), who joined forces with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to form today's Social Democratic PD in 2008.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Left Democrats' party council, she entered high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, of which she soon became head.
She occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD again today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The statements in Brussels that the new EU foreign policy chief has too little diplomatic experience, so lack substance, is countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's suspiciously realistic accents are pursued on the crisis in Ukraine and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course."
It endorses the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe by circumvention of Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy.
After Renzi took up his term as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with outrage in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be working in four training occupations: electronics technicians (three trainees), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended secondary or secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years and the instructors drive to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and get France in order," said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has encountered disapproval among the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said with huge applause.
As an appeasing gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for an easing of the settlement on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow Socialists to show "unified" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, sprinkled sand into the gear in which she appeared at a meeting of breakaway socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the belief in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists' constant trench struggles, saying she could not imagine the new Valls government would hold out for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She echoed her party's call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of emerging as the winner in early elections and was ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in May's EU elections.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is facing the threat of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise close to a $3bn prestige cruises deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships, as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end inconclusively, however.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues stood at $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 percent increase compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, a 6 percent increase over the previous year.
The cruise industry is at about $29 billion overall and is expected for it in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers at the cruise operators.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino mixed company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly own 82 percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-faithful group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The standing committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with Beijing-aligned members.
Through this decision, it becomes almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election and prompted pro-democracy activists to make their threat come true and, with "Occupy Central" protests, paralyze Hong Kong's financial center.
Political reforms have long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that calls for democracy are expanding to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral procedure in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong Affairs and Macaus Office, Feng Wei, should be questioned throughout the day.
Student activists announced they would gather outside the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands from Kiev to start 'state affairs talks' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status to Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits the strategy he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago: help for the separatists in taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow's Crimea peninsula on 18. March had annexed.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the territory taken as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns, for the elections on 26. Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks hope "in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in context with the greater autonomy, which has been under discussion for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification on the correction of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians and polls from before the conflict yielded a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that make important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko struck in his speech at the inauguration on 7. June in front of the Ukrainian legislation should consider - after new elections - additions to the constitution, with which the respective territories are given greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed after another advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk in the hands, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at an EU leadership meeting in Brussels on Saturday and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said reports in Kiev on Saturday.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal over Australian celebs and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger at hackers who presumably stole nude pictures of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of the A-list celebs from Hollywood.
The movie city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence surfaced in a hacking scandal surrounding celebs on the internet.
The hacker in charge of this is believed to have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the tributes of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also private photos became public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebs on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected felt "hurt."
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is lying upstairs without in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love is Invincible," starring Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence told TMZ: "It's a hideous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of stolen goods."
Legally, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were at the 8 yesterday Cycling on the Großer Feldberg and have thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, represented a light workout for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus rode his bike on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put the little muscle soreness away, especially since he is taken part in the 8. Cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
“I know now that I can do this – great!”
A little break on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I'd stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in the early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the eleven-kilometer-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The all-red Green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - made something on understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there's arrival the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He also drove through the track in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to immediately ramble back up to the heights.
Frankfurt's Florian Zierz had swung himself into the saddle at home at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then roll home with fun.
"Fry toni" also had fun.
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had targeted 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo road bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He must be, because he was on the "Fixie wheel", which is also road bikes, but without a gearshift...
Not only the 20 hikers, who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord, proved that it went loosely up to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with four-wheel-drive bully and quad, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself". So the man is, in a way, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30am.
This was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Große Feldberg", gave the starting commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
