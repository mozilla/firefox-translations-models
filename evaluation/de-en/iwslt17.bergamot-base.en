That's James Risen.
You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly published that the NSA had illegally bugged phones of Americans.
But it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for a nuclear bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like the chapter?
the US government.
For nearly 10 years, the government has been investigating Risen, urging him to name his alleged sources.
In that turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media has the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave who reveal it.
So when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many brave reporters were already doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.
So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living at the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential to her case, the government's demands on risks were dropped.
The reason: In the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and getting Risen to testify, that could also do his digital footprints for him.
And so, without his consent, investigators secretly got his phone evidence,
Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even travel evidence with the list of his flights.
In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.
Unfortunately, that's just one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers when he took over. But instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him combined.
Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.
Since the 11th September, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
So we are putting press work at risk, which is to be protected by the First Amendment, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone.
But just as technology allows government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources.
And they can do that from the moment they make contact, instead of afterwards, in the witness stand.
Today, there is communication software that didn’t exist before Risen had written his book, and it’s substantially safer than regular emails or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower transmission system originally developed by the Internet fame, the Aaron Swartz we have left, and has been further developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the one here in the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.
So the government can't secretly procure more information, and much of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.
SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to the freedom of the press in the 21. century to protect.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new spying technologies that endanger us all.
It is up to us to make sure that not only technology connoisseurs like Edward Snowden have a way to bring to light misdeeds. It is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,
who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental worker, who sounds the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. Or a Wall Street insider who warns us about the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were made not only for those who want to uncover crime, but to protect our constitutional rights.
Thank you.
[On 3. April 2016 the biggest data leak in history was published.] [The Panama Papers reveal that rich and powerful have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [What does that mean?] [We asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were of news about a leak of 11 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca
The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.
We get a sense of how clients, banks and lawyers go to firms like Mossack Fonseca and say, "Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?"
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.
This has already led to the first very direct consequences.
Iceland's prime minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.
It is claimed that a $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childhood, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others nervously waiting for the next release, and for the next documents revealed.
Now that sounds like the plot of an agent thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems to be crying away from you, me, ordinary people.
Why would this matter to us?
Yet the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.
And that affects all of us.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Around the world, media and leaders are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we've been discussing and revealing for ten years.
I think to a lot of people this whole world seems very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine it like a Matryosh cap.
So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is the matter.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.
Probably because there have been no prominent Americans who have not appeared in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.
Yet by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the U.S.
In fact, in some U.S. states, you need less information, you need less information to start a company than to get a library card.
This kind of lack of transparency in the U.S. has allowed school district employees to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.
It's that kind of behavior that affects us all.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all of this looks like in practice.
How does it actually work?
So we sent an undercover investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator pretended to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
We were really shocked that everyone except a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator about how he could transfer his money.
These were all preliminary meetings. None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course, no one was handed money over. Yet it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.
This is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions to our undercover investigator.
This is not about a single leader, involved in a scandal.
It's about how the system works through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.
And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.
This may all sound very gloomy, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I see that some things have begun to change.
Over the past few years, we have seen pushes towards greater transparency as far as the owners of firms are concerned.
The issue attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the 2013 G8 summit in Northern Ireland.
Since then, the EU has been in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.
One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is lagging behind.
Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both chambers of parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, being used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind fake companies.
We need leaders in the economy who stand up and say, "Intransparency is not good for business."
We need leaders who recognize the problem and advocate ending this kind of lack of transparency through laws.
Together, we can finally end the lack of transparency that now still allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.
This is the story of how I would have almost kidnapped once and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
A day after I graduated from my design studies, I did a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was just taking a road trip across the country. After that, he would go to the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He told me excitedly how he wanted to change the world.
It was getting late. I got tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him, "Where are you sleeping tonight?"
He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."
And I was like, "Oh, man!
What am I doing now?"
Who doesn’t know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I just got to know him! He says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he's really planning to do that. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
This is a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say, "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room.”
A voice in my head said, "Uh, how?"
At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! What did I get myself into that?
A stranger is sleeping in my living room.
What if he's crazy?"
I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaked to the door on tiptoes, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't crazy.
We are still in contact.
The artwork he had bought from me hangs in his classroom today. He's a teacher now.
This was my first experience as a host. It completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Hosting people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.
Let's take a time jump, two years later...
I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at the time. All the hotels were fully booked.
I believe creativity can manage to turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I was thinking about how we could earn something. Our apartment becomes a designer-bed-and-breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!"
We created a website and thus founded "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.
They thought it was great, and so did we.
I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured with them all over the city. When we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at each other.
Had we just discovered that we could make new friends and pay our rent at the same time?
Things started to roll.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers.
We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it.
So we presented ourselves to the investors: "We want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visitors come by.
Via the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay overnight with them.
This is going to be the next big thing!"
We waited for the rocket to detonate.
But she didn't.
No one who is still quite comforted would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's apartments.
Why?
Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you remember the things you can do well. We were able to design.
At the art academy, we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design do that?
Is it possible to create trust with design?
I would like to give you a taste of the degree of trust we were aiming for.
It's a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
thumbs up when you're ready.
Take your phone in your hand.
Now I'd like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to your left seat neighbor.
This quiet touch of panic that you're feeling now --- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.
Because the only thing that is even more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your text messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to hold a stranger's unlocked cell phone in your hands?
Most people feel the responsibility.
This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.
This is the only reason that our company can exist.
Just like that, who has Al Gore's phone?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for president?
You can return the phones now.
You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some of the discoveries.
What if we had changed a small detail of this experiment?
What if your neighbor had once introduced himself by his name; if he had told where he came from, what his dog or his children were called?
Imagine if you had 150 reviews, all of which say, "He can really hold very well unlocked cell phones!"
How would you feel if you had to drop off your phone?
A well-thought-out feedback system decisively strengthens trust.
In the beginning, we did some things wrong.
It was hard for people to make negative assessments.
Ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest had made their assessments before we put them online.
We discovered something new last week.
We did a study with Stanford. We looked at how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.
Unsurprisingly, we trust the people most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It becomes exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case through assessments.
When you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation stands out in common ground.
So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.
We also learned that trust depends on how much you reveal yourself.
Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.
If you tell too little, such as "Hi!", you are more likely to get no answer.
If you tell too much, such as: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also rather not accepted.
Thus, there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. B. "Great artwork in your apartment! I'm going on vacation with my family."
How can you manage to create this level of openness with design?
We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. We also give tips on which topics to write something about.
Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.
What we had not expected was the large number of people who were more than willing to put off these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.
You can see three things.
First, incredibly good luck.
Second, the tireless work of our team.
Third, a need that had not been met before.
For us, business is going very well right now.
Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.
There were guests who have unauthorisedly celebrated parties or ravaged apartments.
Hosts have left guests standing in the rain.
At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. All the calls came straight to my phone.
I was at the forefront when trust was broken.
There's nothing worse than these calls. It hurts when I think about it.
The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers has always been and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.
Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays brokered, only a fraction each had a problem.
People rightly trusted each other.
When trust works, wonderful things can arise in the process.
One of our guests went on holiday in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even gave blood for the necessary surgery!
Here is his assessment:
“Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.
The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save your life, even though they don’t really know you.
They drive you in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.
They even let you stay longer without calculating the extra nights.
I can only recommend it!"
Of course, not every stay goes on.
But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.
When I first stumbled across this term, I wondered:
How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?
This is about economic trade.
But just calling it "rental industry" now doesn't do justice to the cause.
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People expose a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
Traveling these days can compare it to fast food. It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
But what if travel was a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if, in every place you visit, a group of residents there would wait to bottle you thoroughly and show you on a pub crawl neighborhood that you have never heard of before;
or if you could learn to cook from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we were to design apartments from the ground up to share together?
What would that look like?
What if cities would take on the idea of sharing together?
I imagine cities that enable us to have society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation.
This project has already been started in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking lots that belonged to the government,
have now been offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,
were conveyed to people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs have been launched,
to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. Through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even a host tonight.
So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as we've been taught.
We didn't reinvent the wheel.
Hospitality has existed before.
There were similar websites before us.
So why did ours work?
Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of the trust.
Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I find this amazing,
Downright overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
We know, of course, that design can’t solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had that big impact, I wonder what we can use design for soon.
Thank you.
What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? An expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.
That's actually true.
I'm not blaming you for your negative impressions.
This is how the media represents people who look like me.
One study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show that Americans think most people don’t know Muslims.
Presumably people aren't talking to their Uber drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to meet you.
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.
I'm an introvert,
a would-be fitness fanatic,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.
I've decided to do that.
When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my headgear.
My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "Why are you suppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: At that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, compared to the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable ideal of beauty.
I didn't just passively embrace my parents' faith.
I struggled with the Qur'an.
I read him, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
She was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Koran.
The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.
I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone was perceiving you, understanding you completely, and yet somehow loving you?
That's how it feels.
Later I married and, like all good Egyptians, began my career as an engineer.
I later had a child after my marriage, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where they were.
I sat in my kitchen, had finished breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "eager message."
There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical fault?
My shock quickly turned into outrage.
Why should you do something like that?
I changed the television channel and heard: " ... Muslim terrorists ..." " in the name of Islam ...," " " ... of Middle Eastern descent ...," " ..." Jihad ...," " ... bombs Mecca!"
Oh, my God.
Not only has my country been attacked, but in no time the actions of others turned me from one citizen into a suspect.
The same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.
I remember -- when we drove in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I feared for the first time being recognized as a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't gather."
I stayed inside all week.
Then it became Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray.
And again, the warnings were: "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."
I looked at the extensive coverage.
The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people who were thought to be Muslims, dragged into the open and beat.
There were really arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: we should stay at home.
But something didn't feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
I got people's anger at the terrorists.
Imagine! I was angry too.
It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
It's the accusations that are harsh.
These days, we can actually hear people say, "There's a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.
When are we going to get rid of her?"
Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.
You speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA.
The only question is: are we vicious or benign?
You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.
The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the U.S., but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will the closure of mosques make America safer?
It will perhaps keep a few parking spaces free, but not stop the terror.
Regular visit to a mosque leads to people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater citizen participation.
And as a head of police in the Washington, DC area recently told me: People are actually not being radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
In the radicalization process, it has been found that it starts online. First, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who loathes their behavior and ideology has fallen away from a traitor or from the faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to encourage people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like ISIS bases their brutality with the Koran.
As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would fit into their imagination if recognized as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has with Christianity.
Both groups claim their ideology based on their "Holy Book."
But when you take a look at them, they don't drive what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."
It is her brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.
An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she planned to join ISIS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was exactly the opposite. Every clergyman she had spoken to silenced her and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a main target for instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.
This Imam restored the connection with God and her church.
Instead of accusing her of her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque saved her from joining ISIS.
This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect anyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?
One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: If we are afraid, at least three things happen.
We are more likely to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.
A study shows that when you present messages to test subjects in which negative reports on Muslims, they are more likely to agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected.
It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well-informed citizens.
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
The allocation of collective guilt is not just about having to explain yourself.
Deah and his wife, Yusor, were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the dental school, talented, promising ...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his CV. She was baffled and said,
“When did my little brother become such an accomplished young man?”
Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne's with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. He did it in her apartment, as in an execution after posting remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay home safely?
We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practice our religion.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the child seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.
I took him out, took off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of those gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to help us.
At that moment, I collapsed.
These people were there because they preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.
What are you going to choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you be on the safe side?
Or will you join those who think: We are better than those.
Thank you very much.
Thank you!
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a nerve.
But I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, are a thinker with depth, work in a noble think tank, so are an exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be mistaken. I'm perfectly normal.
I'm no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I'm as ordinary as I'm allowed.
When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest study ever conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.
So I am in no way an exception.
When people seem like an exception to the rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.
What started out as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. This is made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before air parcel delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of an audience. A few years ago, they started flying with ropes.
By connecting to each other, aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.
You can also build self-tightenable structures.
They have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous flight.
In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. This then enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos, we are using a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Each flight engine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board, what the machine should do.
External commands are available at the highest level. e.g. B. “start” and “land”.
This is a so-called rear starter,
an aircraft that tries to kill two birds with one stone.
Like other fixed-wingers, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.
Unlike most fixed-wingers, it can float, and thus has great advantages in take-off and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
One limitation of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.
We are developing new controllers and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind this is that the aircraft can be regained the optimal position in whatever position and the performance can be improved by practicing.
Okay.
During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that reach the core of the matter.
Such a question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known, for example, as machines with a thousand moving parts that come together to hurt you.
Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.
We recently discovered that flying works with only one.
This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. It was recently invented.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges and aillet rudders, no further actuators or control surfaces, just a propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens in the interior so that it can fly stable, and can move anywhere in the room.
Still, it doesn't have the rear starter's elegant algorithm. To make it fly, I have to throw it just right.
The probability of throwing it just right when everyone is watching me is low, that's why I'm showing you a video that was filmed last night.
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
You see that it is extremely symmetrical.
This is why he is ambivalent in his orientation.
This gives him the extraordinary ability to
moving in the room in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even how it rotates.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers.
Some things can be displayed in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.
Let's take a look.
If flying machines are to be part of our everyday lives, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This aircraft consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.
This turns clockwise
and the other counterclockwise.
When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.
However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit restricted.
We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.
The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows for a range of aesthetic expression.
We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equips it with localization technology and algorithms.
Every unit knows where it is in the room and is self-directed. That's why there's no upper limit.
Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe machine over there wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.
For guys like us, the reward is in the development and the creative act.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the one on the cake on the i.
Thank you very much.
1.3 billion years ago, in a galaxy very far away, two black holes orbited each other faster and faster, transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars combined in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.
It was a very big bang.
Their energy, however, did not release them in the form of light --
We are talking about black holes.
All the energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first arrange the events in a time manner.
1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just emerged on Earth.
Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand by us -- even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves created by colliding black holes, for example.
Most thought they were crazy.
But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the U.S. National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work, they built the LIGO detector: the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory.
Subsequently, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.
It is now called Advanced LIGO.
At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.
On the 14. September 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the Earth.
They went through you and me
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
The Birth of My Daughter
and the farewell to my terminally ill father.
These were basically the fruits of my life’s work.
All that I've worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: That's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. He has been studying gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their signals measurable by observatories such as LIGO. What are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a rip in the structure of space and time.
When the wave passes, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and compressed into the other.
For illustration, lecturers often perform a really silly dance in courses on the theory of relativity.
“Destand and swell, stretch and swell.”
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
On the 14. September, for example, each of us was stretched and compressed when the waves were hit. The stretch of an average person was 10 high -21.
That is, 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. That's why the LIGO employees were declared crazy.
With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. That's grotesque.
At the end of his classic text about gravity
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "The technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will surely be overcome.”
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to claim that LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.
I want to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your phone.
That's pretty practical. Because this is how you can make a picture or a map of things by sensing the light coming from several points around you.
With tones, it's different.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That’s why it’s very hard, actually impossible, to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you:
Your child's face, for example.
Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to infer the story behind it.
“Now Alice is speaking.”
“And Bob interrupts them.”
"Dumb Bob."
The same is true for gravitational waves.
We cannot use them to make simple images of objects in space.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the all literally speaking.
Listening to gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been dealing with for a very long time.
SH: Two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!
If the two bodies rotate very quickly, you can hear the same chirping with an additional key change. This sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!
It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.
AA: On the 14th September 2015 -- a date that at least I'll never forget -- LIGO heard the following: [Surring noise] Someone who knows what to listen to recognizes this as a sound of -- SH: ... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass each spinning about as fast as your mixer's rods.
AA: Let's think about what that means.
Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times a second before colliding.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know about it because we heard it.
This is the lasting meaning of LIGO.
LIGO is paving a whole new way to explore space that has never been possible before.
In this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.
Much in space we can't see -- practical or fundamental --.
A supernova, for example. I'd like to know why massive stars explode into supernovae.
They are very useful. We learned a lot about space from them.
However, the exciting physical processes take place in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.
We will never see through it, since these are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first few minutes of space, but we will never see them, as the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.
With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things in everything that we have never seen before, which we will probably never see and of which we have no idea at all. Things we only discover by listening.
In fact, LIGO found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: The kind of stars that produce black holes, as LIGO observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in space, to the formation of the stars and ultimately to how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as brave as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.
After all, what could be better than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time for big dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
Some time ago, I tried an experiment.
For a year I would say “Yes!” to everything I was afraid of.
Whether it made me nervous, put me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say “yes.”
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be on TV?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yeah, yeah.
And a crazy thing happened: doing exactly what I was afraid of eliminated my fear.
My fear of giving speeches, my social fear -- puff, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
“Yes” has changed my life.
"Yes" changed me.
But there was a certain yes that profoundly changed my life, in an unexpected way. It started with a question from my little ones.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. And Emerson, the smallest, calls all "sweether" for inexplicable reasons.
as if she were a waitress from the south.
“Honey, I need milk for my beak cup.”
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. And I said, "Yes."
This Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family. From then on, I swore to myself to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so. No matter what I'm doing right now, or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying a lot.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has a startling side effect: Only recently I actually completely understood that the "yes" saying to play with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I'm a writer. I think things out, bring you to life.
Dream job.
No.
I'm a Titan.
Dream job.
I'm creating TV. I'm producing television.
I do television, in a big way.
In this TV season, I'm responsible for carrying 70 hours of programming out into the world.
Four TV Programs, 70 Hours Of Television. Three to four shows are in production at the same time.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days times four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows that are in production at the same time, sometimes four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: The Catch, 70 hours of television,
$350 million for a season.
In America, my television series run one by one on Thursday night.
Around the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are shows I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, $350 million, campfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else is doing this?
No one, that's why I'm a Titan.
Dream job.
I don't want to impress you with this.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I'm talking about work, so that you understand that I'm not just typing and fantasizing about the computer, and it's true when I say: I understand that a dream job isn't about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard and I love it.
When I am engrossed in the work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nothing.
It's like I set up troops, like I was painting on a canvas.
Just like hitting a high tone, run a marathon.
You feel like Beyoncé.
And all of that at the same time.
I love working.
She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and exhilarating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and sensible. And the best part of it is the buzzing.
There is such a change in me when the work is going well.
A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy road, I could drive on it forever.
Many people assume when I explain the hum to them that I talk about writing, that writing gives me pleasure.
Don't get me wrong, she does.
But the buzzing -- when I started watching television production, when I started working and working and doing, building, creating and collaborating, I discovered this thing, that buzz, that energy. The buzzing!
The buzzing is more than writing.
The buzzing is action and activity. The buzzing is a drug.
The buzzing is music. The buzzing is light and air.
The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.
And if you have a buzz like that, then you can't help but strive for greatness.
The feeling of not being able to do other than striving for greatness, no matter what the price.
This is called the buzzing.
Or maybe it means being a workaholic.
Maybe it's called genius.
Maybe it's called Ego.
Maybe it's the fear of failure.
I don't know.
All I know is that I'm not made for failure, and all I know is that I love buzzing.
I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.
To be clear: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more boundaries overcome, the more work there is, the more things there are, the more things at the same time, the more watch me, the more I write history, the more there are expectations.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, don't I?
The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.
I like that buzz. I love the buzzing.
I need the buzz. I'm the buzzing.
Am I just that buzz?
And then the hum stopped.
Revised, overused, exaggerated, burnt out.
The buzzing stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single work titan.
Harper tells people, “My mom won’t be there, but you can write to my nanny.”
And Emerson says, "Honey, I want to go to Shonda country."
They are the children of a Titan.
They're baby titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The buzzing of the engine fell silent.
I didn't love my work anymore. The engine was off.
The buzzing didn't come back.
My buzzing was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same Titan work, 15-hour days, worked-out weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no buzz.
There was silence in me.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a showpiece titan,
Everything was gray, I just didn't have fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the buzzing and the buzzing was me.
So what do you do when what you do suddenly fades the work you love?
I know some might think, “Cry, stupid author-titan.”
But you know, you do it, you do it, you do, you love what you do, you do, to be a teacher, to be a banker, to be a painter, to be a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzzing when you know the buzzing, and knows what the buzzing feels like, if you ever knew the buzzing, when the buzzing stops, who is you?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?
And then my "Southern waitress" asks me a question.
I'm on my way out, late and she says, "Mom, do you like playing?"
And I want to say no when I realize two things:
First, I have to say yes to everything and second, she didn't call me "sweetheart."
She doesn't call anyone "sweetheart" anymore.
When did this happen?
I miss it when I'm Titan and I mourn my buzzing, and this is where everything changes in front of my own eyes.
And so she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And I say, "Yes."
There's nothing special about that.
We play and her sisters join in, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops".
Nothing extraordinary.
But it's outstanding, because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and lack of buzzing, I can't do anything except watch out.
I'm focused.
I'm quiet.
The country I create, the marathon I'm running, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.
All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, crayons and the song that is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" lets go.
There is peace and simplicity everywhere.
The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.
I can't believe I'm breathing.
Play is the opposite of work.
And I'm happy.
Something in me is loosening.
A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.
And not right away, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzz is slowly coming back.
No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.
Not the buzzing, but a buzz.
And now I feel like I know a magical secret.
But let's stick to this.
It's love. That's all.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It's something we've forgotten.
The buzzing, the sum of work, the titan buzz, that's just the substitute.
When I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and television lessons and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real buzz is.
The buzzing is not a force and it is not work-specific.
It depends on joy.
The real buzz depends on love.
The buzzing is the stream that comes from the lust for life.
The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzz ignores the pressure of the story, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.
The real buzz is simple and original.
The real buzz is God’s voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?
It's just love.
We all need a little more love, a lot more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I make this a common rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.
It's law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzzing again.
I wish it was so easy. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.
Playing isn't pretty much like working.
The truth hurts,
But I don't like playing.
I always work because I love it.
I'd rather be at work than at home.
This admission is painful, because what kind of person does it rather than be at home?
Well, yes, me.
Let's be honest, I call myself "Titan" --
I must have problems.
That I'm too relaxed isn't one of them.
We race around in the garden, back and forth, back and forth.
We do little dance parties,
We sing and play ball.
We're bursting soap bubbles.
I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.
I always reach for my phone.
But it is O.K.
My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I wonder: why did we ever stop playing?
You can do it too! Always say yes if your child wants to play with you.
You might think I'm naive, a daydreamer.
You must be right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? They're not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It's only 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they remember that they want to do something different.
It's a wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I'm Mother of the Year.
It's only 15 minutes, that's all it takes.
Anyone can spend 15 minutes at a time, even on a bad-mood day!
15 minutes at a time!
No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.
The day is short: dinners that make children bed ready for bed.
But 15 minutes is in it!
My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. It doesn't have to be the kids. It is necessary to feel the buzzing, to have a place for his peace of mind.
This is not about playing with your own children. It's about joy,
about "playing" in general.
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what's good for you.
Find out and keep it.
I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. Meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --
“Do you want to play?” is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.
15 minutes at a time, why not treat yourself to a full 15 minutes?
What can be wrong with that? Nothing!
The buzzing came back in my spare time. The buzzing seems to return when I'm not working.
Working does not work without games.
It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown tune, it fills me and my soul. She's tricking me into new ideas. The buzz has made its way again. I use it to the fullest and love my work again.
I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I'm not the buzzing, the buzzing isn't me ... no more.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
That's my buzz now.
The sum of life.
The hum of love.
The hum of the work is part of me, but only a part. And for that, I'm so grateful.
It's sniffing me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan playing trip to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more games.
And yet I have everything under control. My brain is still functioning. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my head is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the buzzing. The land I create, the marathon I am running, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the buzzing, the humming, the other, the right humming: the hum of life.
The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, quivering, naked and new attitude to life spreads within me. Less Titan -- more me!
The more I feel exactly that sum, the more I know who I am.
I'm a writer. I think of things, I'm bringing you to life.
This is part of the job that means living your dream.
This is the dream of this job,
Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more games.
Titans don't stand a chance here.
“You want to play?”
Thank you.
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one second to the next, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.
After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.
That's probably why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
Surely they have heard of one of the most well-known, "deep brain stimulation." An electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.
It really is amazing technology. She has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.
Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-cure.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are approaching this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With some help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At the time, I was senior senior physician and worked in the emergency room day and night.
I often provided traumatic brain injury to patients.
You have to imagine that in traumatic brain trauma, the brain swells and the internal pressure of the skull increases.
To save life, you have to reduce the internal pressure of the skull.
Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.
Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to very young children who are taken out of your families.
You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the environments to make them thrive.
This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François made it.
He saw it under his microscope.
This was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked just like a stem cell culture. With large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.
You may still know from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OR.
We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brains.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
In the stage of the fetus, they provide the folding of the brain.
But why are they preserved?
We don't know that.
We believe they are participating in healing the brain as we find them close to brain injuries at higher concentrations.
That's not so certain, though.
One thing is clear, though -- from these cells we got our stem cells.
We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic range and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did
and then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain.
In the last step, we reimplanted them at the sampling point of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: What happens when we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen if we reimplant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. We were able to work with monkeys Eric Rouiller.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared, as if they had been taken again, they go back home. The room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario, we inflicted an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew into mature neurons.
Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that have been reimplanted.
The evidence they show is these little points. These are the cells we colored in vitro, in culture.
We couldn't stop here, of course.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.
They had to take feed pellets from a tray.
They did very well.
When they had reached a stable skill level, we injured the hand-held motor skills range in the motor cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.
Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to some degree, just like they did with monkeys.
When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left, they see the monkey recovering spontaneously.
It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.
He's not that precise and not so fast.
Now you see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after reimplantation.
I can tell you, these were very exciting results for us as well.
Since that time, we have found out a lot more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example, in Parkinson's.
But our dream is still to implant it in humans.
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, are thinking, "I know someone who can need this."
I'm definitely.
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.
BG: That's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.
BG: Look into the future -- you've completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. If you look further into the future, how many years it will take for someone to come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.
JB: That's hard to say.
First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the agency allow us to start it soon?
Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
It has been a long time to select patients, perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this type of treatment.
After that, this must be applied to a multicenter study.
You really need to prove first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.
BG: And that it's safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and for telling us about it.
BG: Thank you very much.
Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake in taking them for granted.
We see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.
We tend to think of them as an immutable give-up.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That's not true.
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.
Earlier this year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that our country's democratic process -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realised in Greece.
At that moment, I thought that there might not be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Chinese Communist Party, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it changed anything.
At this point, I would like to introduce you to an economic model for a true democracy.
I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and even the Eurogroup, are succumbing to a mistaken belief that we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.
Because without democracy, our societies will be more mean, our future bleak and our great, new technologies are wasted.
On the subject of waste, I would like to draw your attention to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies.
I call it the "Twin Summit paradox."
A summit is known to you. They know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
But few people recognize his twin.
A mountain of unused cash that belongs to wealthy savers and corporations, but which are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and could bring in income, with which you could carry down the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example, "green" energy.
I give them two numbers.
In the past 3 months, $3.4 trillion has been invested in the US, in England and the eurozone, combined, in all the wealth-producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, and did absolutely nothing except bloat the exchanges and drive up real estate prices.
Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not balanced by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds unemployed in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, reinforces investor pessimism, which, fearing low demand, promote it themselves, in which they do not invest. Just like Oedipus's father, who, out of fear, the oracle's prophecy, could come true that his son would kill him if he grows up,
Unintentionally, the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.
This is my struggle with capitalism --
its exceedingly wasteful manner. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talent and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to saving the earth.
Is democracy the solution?
I think so. But before we continue: What do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.
Athenian democracy, of course, excluded too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.
The decisive factor in Athenian democracy was and is that it included the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive is that it granted them the right to political participation with equal voice weighting in matters of state concerns.
Athenian democracy did not last long --
Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.
However, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,
but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.
Because liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process narrowed down to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.
In our democracies today, since the time this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two has taken place, gradually inferring politics and disempowering politics.
Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as they used to be?
It's not because of a degeneration of their DNA.
It's because you can be in government these days and still not in power because power has migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate.
I mentioned my struggle with capitalism.
When you think about it, it's about like a herd of predators that has so sustainably decimated the animals it feeds on that it ends up starving.
It is similar with the economy, which has cannibalized politics to such an extent that it harms itself through the self-induced economic crisis. The power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality is increasing, overall economic demand is falling and the managing directors of the corporations are too terrified to invest the cash of their companies.
The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks become, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.
If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.
This is not a new idea, by the way.
The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.
The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position only by a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem with this is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, automation will make the twin peaks higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it will -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.
So we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, taking care that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we will end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.
The question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --
The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or by something that resembles society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve humans and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," indulge in the meaning of life in long conversations.
I think we can be optimistic.
So what would it take, what might it look like to have this "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of the "Matrix"-like dystopia?
In the practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples, in a very short time.
In the field of companies: Please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.
Then all income comes from capital and proceeds, and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.
No more distinction between those who own the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not own the company. No more tug-of-war between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no outstanding twin summits.
In the field of global political economy: Please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 Largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity.
Continue to imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government deposits the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.
Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It's basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
The problem was that at that time it was not necessary to implement the technical means.
Today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified politics and economy.
The world I describe to you is at the same time libertarian, in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.
But above everything else, it's a world where we can imagine a real democracy.
Will we awaken in such a world
Or will we sink into a "matrix"-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we decide politically together.
It's in our hands, and we better do it democratically.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.
How relevant is Marx’s analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If any of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is ... If we fail, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,
Just like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm completely confused.
BG: Actually, and now we probably are.
YV: When you're not confused, you don't think enough.
BG: That's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers' dinner you said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.
As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is happening -- the realm of the economy -- is a completely democracy-free zone.
In some respects, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th. century.
Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.
Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
He was particularly skeptical about democratic development.
What can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
accusing China now of doing what the West did in the 19th Century itself has done, smells tremendously of hypocrisy.
BG: I'm sure many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece earlier this year.
YV: I knew this was coming.
BG: Yes...
How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a fresh start with the eurozone,
not just Greece, but the eurozone,
In fact, to say goodbye to the complacency, and to the constant denial that a massive line of rejection was passing through the eurozone, and continues to do, which threatens the development of the whole European Union massively.
We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --
to make it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, have continued to vote for the denial.
But you know what's coming.
This is the experience from the Soviet Union --
If you try to keep an economic system that is not survivable, alive through political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructively.
BG: What change do you anticipate?
YV: There is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its build-up.
BG: Did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone who looks back -- Seriously...
If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the request to extend the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the donors to find a common solution.
But that didn't exist.
They just wanted to bring down our government just because they didn't want to deal with the fault lines that were going through the eurozone.
They did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
It's worse than during the "Great Depression."
No one from the troika of the donors that imposed this policy on us admitted: "This was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you still seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.
My biggest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.
Because if it does not survive, the centrifugal forces released will be demonic and destroy the European Union.
This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, according to which it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-European.
BG: We very much hope that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you so much for joining TED.
YV: Thank you.
Most have never heard of Roy Price, though he's likely to be for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on the 19th. April 2013 is responsible.
Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
That goes back to the decision Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,
Amazon's TV production company.
He's 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, tech, tacos."
Roy has a very important job because he's responsible for picking out the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can't pick any.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are on the far right of this curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. The rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows receive this rating.
If your show is rated nine and higher, this is a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks, "Where's more of these episodes?"
This kind of show.
On the left, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.
Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."
He's more concerned about the medium bulge, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.
So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.
The pressure is there, and of course it's also the first time Amazon has done something like this, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.
He wants to create success.
He needs guaranteed success, so he's holding off a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and, through an evaluation, selects eight contestants for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where anyone can watch them for free.
And if Amazon releases things for free, you're accessing it, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are being watched by Roy and his team, who record everything.
They record when you start the show, when to pause, which parts you skip or look at again.
They collect millions of data to use this data to then decide which show they should produce.
In fact, they collect the data, process it and that results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators."
They made this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because she wasn't so good.
It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of that curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards.
Around the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's program design manager. Just like Roy, he's always looking to find this one super show and he's also using data for it, but he's doing it a little differently.
Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give to the shows, their history, what shows they like, etc.
Then they use this data to find out these little details about viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the pieces together, they took a dare and decided to do not a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. So exactly where they wanted to go.
Of course, the question is: What happened here?
You have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
They connect this a lot of data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
What's that up?
Because the logic somehow says that this should work with everything.
If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, then you should be able to make a good decision.
You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.
You optimize it with very powerful computers.
The least you can expect is good TV, right?
If data analysis doesn't work like this, then this is a bit terrifying because we live in a time when we're reaching for more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.
Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
Nobody. Okay, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. If you come into contact with this, you're in prison.
If someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asking for release, it's likely that this company's data analysis is used to determine whether or not a release is made.
Just like Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.
Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,
Not always the best results. This is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn’t know how to use data.
Even the data of the most experienced companies is sometimes wrong.
Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.
In 2009, Google announced that they could predict outbreaks of flu, of the bad kind, through data analysis -- through data analysis of Google's research.
It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."
It worked flawlessly, year after year, until suddenly it stopped working,
and no one could say why.
It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."
Even the data of most accomplished companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data is increasingly flowing into life's decisions -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we should make sure that data is helpful.
I also know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably a lot of data to make serious decisions, such as choosing cancer therapy
or the development of a drug. Over the years, I have identified some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. This pattern should be spread.
If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:
First, break this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the items; second, put the items back together to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this several times, but it's always two things: take it apart and put it back together.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break down a problem and understand its parts.
They are not suitable for putting the parts back together and then coming to a decision.
There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.
If there is something the brain is good at, it is to put parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, then to make a good decision -- especially if it's an expert's brain.
That’s why, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience what they would not otherwise have been capable of. But the decision on how to take all these parts, put it back together and make a show like "House of Cards" out of it, that was not in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they took a big personal risk with this decision.
Amazon, on the other hand, did this the wrong way.
They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were vying for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say, "That's what the data tells us."
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data starts to control our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.
Many of you will...
Before there was data, this was the device for decision-making.
Many people know it.
It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". It's amazing. For decisions using a yes or no question, all you have to do is shake the ball to get a response. "Highly likely" -- right here at this moment.
I'll fight it later with a technical demo.
I've made some decisions in my life so far, with me supposed to have listened to the ball afterwards.
But, of course, as you know, when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analytics, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.
And I find this very encouraging news that, despite the large amount of data, it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks.
Because in the end, it's not the data, but the risks you end up at the right end of the curve.
Thank you.
