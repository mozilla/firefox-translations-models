Diego Cocca appointed new Mexico coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is the name of a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering islands are to be created over a large area, on which insects can find food at all times. "When the weather is favourable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht NABU. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the undertaking does not only remain an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also draws wide circles into private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January, the season started for the wild hazel
More recent are shrubs such as winter scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been in the soil of the pots on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad-bushed shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it reads, among other information, such as the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the season already started for the wild hazel. It blooms particularly abundantly on the Richtweg near the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her when he looks down from the sky to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there at 3 p.m. sharp in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (15 January 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap-dancing is my life, I can't imagine without it."
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) will also be dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the round of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced during dancing that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome here."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitization progresses, some people's desire for analogue is growing again
The speed with which our everyday lives became digital left us hardly any time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. In 1985, if you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen, there were three options. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighbourhood and could call their relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of the coins in the machine are unforgettable. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, as it occupies 63 of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, there will be a proper celebration again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't have to be asked for long.
The father of the country, Markus Söder, did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja.
Completely out of touch: Minister for Science and the Arts, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
State parliament president Ilse Aigner looked for none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Master Builder alias Construction Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side is his wife Gerswid.
On the road: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition was not to be missed.
Everything for Bavaria: Green parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD parliamentary group leader's pleasure: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It was royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side is Mrs. Andrea.
If it doesn't work out with politics anymore, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's Lord Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
On the road as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR's legal director, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural programme director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side blow against the climate activists by the Franconian Tatort inspector Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already been enough to successfully defend the title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the chase race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, nothing came together for Doll again. After the veteran had missed all chances for a medal at the start with a penalty loop in the mixed relay and only finished sixth, things didn't go any better three days later. Three penalties in prone and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he surprisingly won by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing pulled away without a word after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main focus is on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula replied with a view to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is gloomily reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not pay much attention to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied - an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? It showed the members of the Red Army Faction who had been cleared for denunciation and shooting.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, this was how public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties here.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world, to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong, there are perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: Ms. Wagenknecht is in places 1 to 5 (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my environment who reads this paper anymore. If it does, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level, where nothing is below that.
And now, at the latest, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership with the competent court through his family lawyer. I don't comment on details."
Glööckler and his partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the house they shared in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned for German-French youth encounters, among other things.
One curve for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ series North Lippe hamlets: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in Homeien. Here the residents will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be "absolutely" necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. "The inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and held out the prospect of a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can curb demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher interest rates on loans can lead to investments being postponed and thus economic growth is weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are driving inflation significantly, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "This is what I currently see as the greatest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "German pace" for infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge that does not necessarily have to be as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to some extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. On the occasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "Germany pace". In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried with the classic set of rules and did not succeed. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was correct. Maybe we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
In view of the many open tasks, for example in the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it gets."
Union warns against break-up of Bayer Group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the company after an announced change of boss at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is exactly in the right position for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, member of the union's board of directors and Bayer supervisory board, the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health division with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be mastered with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the change of boss at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave the post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, completed in 2018, hangs over the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the company. Bayer stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to ratify the actions of the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was actually supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also been involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the value of the company," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing a government plan with concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected nationwide on Saturday to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilizing against the plans of the centrist government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. A turbulent debate on the controversial reform has been going on in parliament for a week.
Many people in France already work longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a full pension when they reach the age limit. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of the reform. In addition, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Impending deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government does not only want to tweak the retirement age. The increase in the necessary payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protest and strikes were certain for everyone.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, which have announced support. However, some of the MPs - even from Macron's parliamentary group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is Macron's concern about crippling strikes at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "It is true that this high will shift a little to the east in the course of the next week. But it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges there is pure sun."
Sunday will start foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it may also rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover will loosen up during the day and the sun will appear more and more often. In the rest of the country, it will remain very cloudy or covered in high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually stronger sun will nibble at the high fog again and can dissipate it more and more in the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it will first have to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum temperatures will be 5 to 9 degrees, in the Lower Rhine around 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only around 3 degrees are expected. In addition, weak winds will blow from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may again only be a tough resolution of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be bright after the fog has cleared. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun will shine all day, according to the forecasts. Temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The beaten top favourite Sofia Goggia has been deeply disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," said the Italian on ZDF after she threaded at a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races of the season so far in this discipline. After gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky skiing style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. She was absent from her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was a matter of hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not".
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information on their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child. 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school on February 10, 2023 at around 12:30 p.m. together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and location.

Zelensky and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed at a joint telephone conference to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympics, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Secretary Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and unacceptable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, said afterwards that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it rejected a start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa inquiry.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they are clearly committed to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently declared that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violated the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk up where it happens
"Hey, butt!", whistling after the fool in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting lewd sayings: All this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : US sees Moscow's tank stock decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? U.S. sees Moscow's tank inventory decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. We are talking about "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army have been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates at an online event of the Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 main battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, their delivery is likely to take much longer.
Russia wants to up the ante
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces, for example.
Fuss about filling posts in the army
Because the post, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The staff representative of the academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for a previously unfilled position, said the minister. She did not want to comment on "speculation by a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been dispelled.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision has the "appearance of post-haggling," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go down on their knees at costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold of Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, among other things for security, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "Train of the Merry People" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades were cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold of Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors are not found or the previous ones contribute even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that doesn't work every year". The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In some cases, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther of the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Association. Due to luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. Nevertheless, it is already clear that it will be more expensive for the move. Twice as many staff are needed for security as in 2020.
Those who stand by the wayside of the Shrove Monday procession in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants do not have so much with them. Camels or not, the rush of visitors is likely to be large: "I think if it doesn't rain from buckets on that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there has been no regular Shrove Monday parade for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the train."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally "loss-making", that is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Home-Distilled Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered hard-drinking for nothing. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't see much difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here mainly in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. Nobody knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But that only applies if it goes on mass sale. There will probably also be adulteration.
FC Hansa Rostock rewarded for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer at the end of the day, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and Oberhof's mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the World Championships sprint in Oberhof. But there were two rays of hope in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to tell from the grandstand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile and referred to the wafts of fog that repeatedly drifted into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the spectators on the Rennsteig.
Nevertheless, Steinmeier enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Biathlon has fascinated me since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernised sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have pitched in here since the World Championships were awarded." In terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outpaced the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting penalty and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two rays of hope behind the gray veil. Benedikt Doll, on the other hand, disappointed again. After his botched mixed match on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five targets this time and disappeared into the locker room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had started the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility. However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the brave; they each landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In the women's race, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with the number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling said of his "locomotive". The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee's ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the togetherness on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike behaviour. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches had also been sent off. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was shown a yellow card. "The coach's behaviour also falls into the area of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike conduct consistently," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the ratio is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected person then has to live with this. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, those involved had cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process were to get underway overall, that such behavior is simply not appropriate," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behaviour," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race, the victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia finished third.
The German combined athletes will not compete in the Black Forest with their best line-up: Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek will not be there. They are preparing for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia, with training in Oberstdorf. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people have been slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a statement from the police, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist hit a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Have brought the exhibition to life: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, 12 February, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In each of the three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the works of art disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marl Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-mounted art in the service of the community. Using numerous pictorial examples, she presents the special features of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in architecture in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7 magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6 magnitude quake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
The penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow, died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the Left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus loses "an important personality," said parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The parliamentary group leader of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. That will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow was "quite critical" of the new state. German unity was completed too quickly, the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and it was too one-sidedly condemned as an "unjust state," Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to the Ukrainian energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The situation is particularly bad with the power supply in the Kharkiv region. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was curtailed.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terrorism. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, an important Ukraine supporter, shortly before the anniversary. Meanwhile, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kyiv, an air alarm was triggered for the fifth time for the day late Friday evening. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, it was agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, is to be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not have to generate and transfer profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of remedying this situation with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken in Herrmann-Wick's favor at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, was "totally excited", her pulse did not come down when she ran in. "Such a race," and that at the home World Championships, "you can't describe it in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had planned to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she is currently in fifth place. And even though the women's performance density is significantly higher at the top than the men's, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been very tense since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting to overthrow him together with the US government.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been cancelled, and other projects are threatened with the same, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment amount is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag adopted in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, less money will be available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), at around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the motorway at the Kupferzell motorway entrance in the direction of Heilbronn. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, according to the police. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totalling around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarters commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is occupying the world. On Stuttgart's Schlossplatz, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them on Friday evening.
Many community members had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's supplication in earnest and silence. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for support and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration ceremony. The supplications were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamische Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind in Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought to the earthquake areas by truck. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because if you don't sit in the middle of a stone desert thanks to your home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, you can now use your lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk into the fresh air. At least that's the impression you could get around Lake Egglburg, where not only dog owners cavort between 12 and 2 p.m.
One reason, of course, could also be that people in modern times can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things in the course of optimal use of the time slot. After all, why not learn news from the settlement on the occasion of a short walk through nature from the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Altes Kino? It would also be possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done excellently is the acquisition of natural goods. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to the cheese on a table by the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. It's just stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and regret in their voices. "It's a pity, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. Which you also let the sympathetic chance acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! They do have a bag with them!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which you have quickly thrown on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat and on this short midday excursion you have not only been enriched by a saddle of lamb, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the district road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons that have not yet been clarified, left the road in a left-hand bend to the right, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a delineator, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured man to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of unfitness to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi suffered a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's Tax Records: Point for the Rule of Law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office of the President of the USA
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision said on Friday.
Contrary to political conventions in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He defended himself all the way to the Supreme Court against handing it over. A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, but no details of them were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of authorized access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information repeatedly leaks out of parliament.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president," Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, the people of today rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes just push people and Hamburgers in between. In her new programme, Lucy van Kuhl shows that there is something exciting about the "in-between" state.
In a humorous and thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of many things - and one or the other is also between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. in the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British felon caught after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British Criminal Investigation Department NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 from the start of a court case in which he had been sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table
Bielefeld
What is served remains a secret in advance. Because people should come to the Vesper Church first and foremost to meet others, not because something specific is on the menu. It starts this Sunday, when Neustadt's St. Mary's Church will become a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humour, takes up the cudgels for science in his cabaret programmes. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scepticism about science remains to be seen. In any case, his humor fits very well in Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what science actually is and what it can do - and above all what it can't. Of course, there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironic. And so you are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new in the process.
Please go to the typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many people's lives.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley floor there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles that become increasingly difficult to hit as the game expands. In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction procedure, the game initiation procedure, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test procedure. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the START push button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A clue can be, for example: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a point representing the enemy position becomes visible on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN THE FIRING AREA will be displayed in the upper left hint display at the same time.
At times, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are intended to round off the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A Super Tank drives and spins twice as fast as the Player Tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for another more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option can be found in the figure.
5. Initials input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of maximum scores, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage will delete the table with the maximum results. When reset, the ten (10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and are re-inscribed on the screen to challenge more players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically inscribe strokes. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. CONSTRUCTION ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI gear lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper function of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever back to the center position. The micro switches are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make it easier to play. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Equipment inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some verification to round out the quality control. To be sure that the appliance has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the appliance to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect the outside of the case for damage. B. Open the maintenance cover of the device and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose plugs together.
NOTE: Never make plug connections by force. The plugs are provided with a forced guide so that a correct connection is made. A connector connection twisted 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the connector connections to the game PC board for proper and tight fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Controller/Audio II PC Board and the TV Monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back of the cover page of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for more service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains power and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, check whether the radar screen is also in the bright, orange-circled opening of the fairing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the panel, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games. Checking System Configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you're not sure if your PC is up to par. To access the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, please follow these steps: Click the Start button and select the Run option. In the text box, type "dxdiag". Now the user interface of the DirectX Diagnostic Tool appears. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can check if the graphics and sound are working properly, among other things, by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
There may be times when other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious to be active, and many are launched automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That's why we recommend that you quit such background applications before launching the game. - If your system is running antivirus or Crash Guard programs, you should close or disable them before launching the game. To do this, find the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable", "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also quit general background applications as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to quit all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system
Before you install any software, make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games will run largely smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk tools or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup. Using Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and select the Help (or Help & Support) option to access Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive instructions that explain how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This is often a way to prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to create video games was sparked in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression through which to push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had a vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny fraction of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on "action" and forgetting a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. In the meantime, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits sensations. While this could have been done in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at crates to obtain ammunition, but also has far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you're more skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your attitude. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we have been forced to question many of the principles previously considered incontrovertible. I would be lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - does not leave you completely unscathed. David Cage
THE README FILE
There is a ReadMe file on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM where the license agreement and updated information about the game can be viewed.

Damage
If external transport damage is recognisable, it must be complained about immediately, recorded on a transport note and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, Federal Railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Line voltage
The device is set for the mains voltage indicated on the nameplate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. In accordance with VDE regulations, the device is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Flawless operation of the coin system requires the device to be set up horizontally and perpendicularly. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn the machine off for a short time (pull the power plug) and on again. If the device does not work properly after that, a repair is necessary.
Pull the power plug before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch live parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. ATTENTION, HIGH VOLTAGE! At the anode connection of the picture tube there are about 20000 volts. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A blown fuse signals overloading of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections while the device is turned on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (for minimum credit 2) for 2 players. You have to try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The gameplay is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. If the red lines meet, additional SPARX will be released. In the event of an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your area, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross or return your own path. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted using the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device - the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming Display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits" that may be set before the start of the game can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" button several times, the factory or default setting can be achieved, if the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (as the lines that appear green are called) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10,000) is used to transfer the High Score points to the next program display until "High Hit Rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs in order for his own initials (names) and hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked - if there is a coin lock. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 so that by inserting a coin, the credits cannot become zero if above 99 is added. A free spins mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Number Credits" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": the amount of the % number that must be reached in order to switch to the next round
"Time Limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Level of difficulty of the game
"Attraction tone": no sound at "0" when stationary
at "1" sound also at stationary mode (animated sound) "table model": at "0" floor-standing device
at "1" tabletop device
The credits per coin are set on the "slot programming" meter. High-score program display (highest hit rate so far). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score selected on the previous display (setting it to "back"). Pressing the "Up" button will set the initials QIX Standard. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "overall evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts again. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Credits paid: Number of credits given for coins inserted (converted). Credits granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits Granted (Credits Paid + Credits Granted per 100) Minutes Played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, if the game is extended or won. % Leisure: Minutes Gained/Minutes Played per 100. Average Playing Time in Seconds: Minutes Played/Credits Paid + Granted
High Score: The number of times a player had enough high hit rates to knock other players out of the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the operator or a different setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons will select the programming while the top digit will light up green on the screen. The size values change with the change in the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is applied. If a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting is desired, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing it once, the upper number of settings is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his tuning efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not appropriate. Once the adjustment has been made, any new size to be adjusted can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. In case of unintentional pressing, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. Pressing the "Test" button completes the process. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value does not use "0". CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably indicates failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the 'Sub-Test' button or the 'Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" button the next program is displayed. If an endurance test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto-test mode. In this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" indicator appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be inserted. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is error-cleared, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM Memory in a given game can be introduced as a Banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional safety of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt holds with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communications RAM's fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: faults in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are reset to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device holds with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Test U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy will stop the program and the LEDs will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it shows that the next check is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be in place and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd one made sure that the right jacket arrived without any recognizable seam defects. BUT: I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself on the basis of the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size.... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and hips... I could swim in the rest. In addition, the food material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just a pity.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I decided on the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and the support doesn't quite fit. But that's my mistake. Then I changed something slightly to make it fit. The support looks very robust and you don't damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately too big for less than 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months we have looked for him out again and he can use him. Has not yet been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth. And when it was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back
I was probably blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say. But that it can (as written in many reviews) keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it would be like that, but there can really be no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more sloppy. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly of high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack would go back. If I buy equipment of many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend the money for a reasonable backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you can certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, I had liked the electrical series by E. L. Todd best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. The part is about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time and I found it unnecessarily protracted. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to himself and then is like a little child at every argument and warps?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I was hoping that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more suspense back into the story.
Man destroys everything, appreciates nothing and does not learn! First of all: The film is not as bad as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and always conceived according to the same scheme. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often have I thought about the movie (even though I know that it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often tears in your eyes. That's why Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a pity that the person just doesn't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream movie. We consistently destroy the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of belongings and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: none. 4 stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - he is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with him and don't expect anything from him that he doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, so much for orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately only seen too late), for the larger one a full 5 ? That's very, very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I have used the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a roughly maroon (a little darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it one more time, as in the instructions even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first try. What was the worst of all, it still smelled weeks after use. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an even longer additional illness. I wanted to give my immune system a boost not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Highly recommended.
Function not quite flawless !! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major defects, which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems "connecting" to the mobile phone over time. This means that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the mobile phone in the case, the lid is now so worn out that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I think that a case with battery should work perfectly in its function and that's why, for the cost of 30€, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I expected a lot more from these scarves, it is really very thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it, I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side, the price for these scarves is far excessive, more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell into the shower), reproduces bass as well as bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. That's why I have to deduct a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places the paint was chipped off and if you just went over it by hand, the paint came off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but as if both dressers were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A PRAISE to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered, which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't complain about it as I needed this product urgently. The included adhesive hardly holds, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The stencils are partly incompletely punched out. For single use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic clasps + Beautiful look + Stable when set up + Shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slam with magnets (can perhaps be compensated with rubber studs) - some unclean places
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no others and since there was no trophy in the house, glued them down with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with some paper and leveled it out) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars,  because you have to make everything fit in order to be really satisfied. Besides, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me.... but
... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually wrapped see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and will soon get full marks.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery, so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered. But declined for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, workmanship inadequate
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board smiles at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this accommodatingly and quickly, but I only realized that after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living rooms, I would personally go for warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that too and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is a help, I would be happy to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I've received gestures, and I'd like to share my first look. Yes, positively. I thought for a long time whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after swiping and they are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-stock sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping is simply great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, tap unpacked and all parts checked. We found out that the part had already been installed before. We found considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and returned. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement, because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; Never again will we order such goods via Amazon, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store, where we get decent goods. I just think it's sad that customers are being fooled like that!!
Product itself top, external sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity are always displayed. This is a pity, because the device was attached to the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak grass collector
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still driving cheerfully through the republic with Hermes as of today, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is powerful and it results in a nice sectional pattern. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big drawback is the collection basket. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and made of fabric in between. If you put it down full for a short time, then of course it is compressed and parts of the contents fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical fill level indicator points to red even when the collection basket is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass collector makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The pluggable sensor cable supplied is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save battery. I only give 4 stars for the following reasons. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm if the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw practically falls out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The poles that hold the cart are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because it's impossible to print something that way. To the assembly: The assembly was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to relay them several times, which is very exhausting. I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. I had expected a little more.
Robust and precise, I'm pleasantly surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slide leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. There is a clear purchase recommendation from me and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and didn't wear it for the time being, because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it was constantly "aired". After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate against purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simple overall, so I have already torn the clasp open twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that this will not work / last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewellery
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't work, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately junk! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some gimmicking.... if you stick to the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after only one hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, not so useful for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against a purchase, it will only bring trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I bought it again for only one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the drainage would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production error and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, because, as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
It could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. In the beginning, everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this can also be done with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I have not found a suitable flat-head screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you've screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread broke off the third time I mounted it and thus the entire thing was unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the stated dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, e.g. for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/sachets. Not of high quality, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So-so
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't do it anymore. Battery? Bartered. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. Battery life is very long. Definitely perfectly sufficient sound. I liked the fact that the headphones don't hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Price-performance is fully in line here, especially since I also bought it in a flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could do with a little more fabric (if you don't have as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse than that. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold today. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliable as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it won't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you can't press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the movie or even anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a disdainful extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this bulky lump with golden plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick doesn't just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is within narrow limits :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters, which I also had to send back, could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation :P There was a small adapter with which it can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic mount. With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it holds so securely and has contact from there... All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and made in one aluminum piece sturdily. Price-performance fits.
Tons of power
Top device. Has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but it does a lot of power. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised, in live mode the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m. In offline mode, however, when the dog is in the house, it likes to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution would be great here that would last 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, the battery would not have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it daily. You should deal with the dog, not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in sports class, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair it was also the case in normal use that they didn't last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these here are poorly processed at first glance. They are comfortable just like the ones I owned before. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely won't last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to be read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on a whim. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery. About the mattress: I put it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that this one doesn't reappear. When inflated, a lying test was carried out directly. It is easy to lie on and fits perfectly with the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully in my car. Previously, we took out the seats at the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the connector was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my boyfriend is a handyman, he was able to repair it and reassemble it, the good part worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it won't lose any air and that it will last a long time. Likewise, that the mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of toys. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open over several doors directly on day 1 due to the ridiculous workmanship. On the 21st door there were no doors at all and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly, as they were already coming towards him. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies with it. Indoors, it flies very well and the 5 min. flight time is usually quite sufficient. I didn't expect anything else that hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks down very quickly at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, nice contact.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it's not a game CD but just a code with which you can download the game. That would be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer has been hanging up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and appearance great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. Service worked well.... And yet I send them back. Three big catches: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, only lying on the cabinet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end of the day at noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, not useful for me. What a pity.
Noble shell with restrictions
For the raunchy Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case. Recently, I liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. This is what the case offers here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it gets too much, then the lid is a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only at the ports there are cut-outs. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. It doesn't even work on the QI leather charging station from TORRO. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality cover with bulletproof glass film
Robust case with a real tempered glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and fits firmly on the phone. Overall, a good buy.
