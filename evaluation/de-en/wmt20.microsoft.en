Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night to Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanethiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the environment smelled extensively of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system following an industrial accident.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. For 57 days there was no trace of the - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I felt sick," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
Hoping Katie might still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalled to Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Presumably, a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and appeals in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a phone call: A man came forward and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie was already gone. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to Daily Inter Lake. "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has lost 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This emerges from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a weapon part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have resurfaced so far. The weapons and weapon parts that are still missing include six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 gun barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is "frightening," said Left Party MP Martina Renner. This is all the more true since hardly anything has been found in the course of investigations. The Left politician spoke of a "poor balance". Renner criticized the fact that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition included the one found in connection with the investigation against the Bundeswehr officer Franco A., who was suspected of terrorism. "And this despite the fact that a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after it was detained by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. As vessel observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker started moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was given as the destination port.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was seized on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off Britain's Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Angela Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the former GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU parliamentary group on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The horror was taken away from the state security," she said.
Musk aims for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold record. Despite the delivery boom, there have recently been losses at the electric car group.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have a chance to hit our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said. The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla would have to mobilize as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a plus of over six percent. The price has not risen so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. This was found out by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children resist tickling so fiercely, only to demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why just approaching a tickling hand triggers laughter before touching. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers laughter at the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - so therefore people can not tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers have now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-contact. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign touch and tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were intensified.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others happen at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In the experiment, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely, showing flight behavior or paralysis. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral response that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Major fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy to the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have escaped. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The sister of the Prime Minister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the lifting of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The prime minister is threatening to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without an agreement if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he intends to achieve this, however, is unclear.
Of Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to leave the EU." Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election campaign by a right-wing extremist.
Memorial to attacks in Oslo and Utöya unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (german: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They are reminiscent of the roses that thousands of people had deposited in front of the cathedral in Oslo in the days and weeks after the attacks.
At the same location, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to attend the opening.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which was held in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai, among other things, for medical examinations, said shipping company boss Erik Hånell. Around noon, the ship left Iranian waters. "Nice that it's over," he told Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Office in London described the detention of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with ocean freedom. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well under the circumstances, Hånell said. They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and stressful situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working on reuniting them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected behind the arrest of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was said to have been destined for Syria, was chained there. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against war-torn Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected speculations that it had been a barter deal to free the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US single-handedly withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter agreement extended to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protecting powers.
India is obstructing a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war profiteer". In view of the punitive tariffs imposed by American President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reschedule. CFOs of Asian firms considering moving production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this is not only due to the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be made to play a more important role in the globally ramified production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Pejoratively dubbed the "Kingdom of Tariffs" by the warhorse in the White House, America withdrew trade benefits for 2,000 products from the emerging market at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the friction with India is merely a sideshow. In addition, America also looks at the world's largest democracy through the lens of security policy. Delhi and Washington share concerns about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, is therefore likely to be lulled into safety.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a hard time in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity that stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies can now obtain building permits for buildings more quickly. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India in the first five years of Modi. But this does not apply to trade policy. Inspired by the desire to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national-conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi has the aura of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In essence, however, the "India First" advocate never moved away from protectionist economic policies, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the core voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Funeral of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported, citing Chirac's family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral service was scheduled in the Paris Invalides, as media reported.
Carrying the rival to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world's best had long since crossed the finish line when heartwarming scenes unfolded in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first heat of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously. A good 300 meters before the finish, he could hardly stand on his feet, running in an unhealthy stooped posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hooked him under him and dragged him to the finish line supporting the last half stadium lap. However, the forces were still sufficient for both to stop the running wristwatch after crossing the finish line. As if the scene wasn't curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in that situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, as he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shyly, he dodged at first, did not want to talk at all about his heroic deed. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the world federation. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did so emphatically that evening - and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even gave way to his rival Busby at the finish and voluntarily took last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this heat. In the end, it was of no use, because Busby, who only crossed the finish line with a lot of help, was disqualified by the International Athletics Federation in the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, competed to set a personal best at the World Championships in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I've been under 18 minutes before." However, only in training, where best times do not count.
Million-dollar scam: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already stepped up their street checks and searched pedestrians' mobile phones, some of them for messages and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of al-Sisi
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million-dollar march" in central places in the country today, Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution." For most young Egyptians, the man is not a "good guy" either, because he made millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are getting through.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Initially, these figures could not be independently confirmed. The government also did not confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time,'" HRW said, citing lawyers of those arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against those arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist organization". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, questioned and searched random passers-by, according to HRW.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to the report, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
One could not exempt the companies from the VAT on donations in kind, said the Ministry in response to a question from the Green parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, retailers could set the market value of unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay little or no VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that Germans return every sixth parcel when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost companies additional money, because the tax authorities value donations in kind as a turnover on which VAT is then incurred.
Green parliamentary group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being penalized for donations. This applies not only to online retail, but also to other businesses from fashion stores to DIY stores.
Banksy Art for Auction: There Has Never Been a Better Time to Sell This Painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the South West of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - coinciding with the original Brexit date of March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The painting could change hands for millions of dollars.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered on Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons after the lifting of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court a hard exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to complete the Brexit, which has already been postponed twice, on 31 October, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It's not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in south-east England, he painted a picture of a man using a chisel to break a star of the European flag. The factory is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. "We enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of "betrayal" of the people. He dismissed accusations that he could put MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore calm was for MPs to finally respect Britain's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that three years after the referendum, Britain has still not left the EU.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If things go badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India revoked the autonomous status of the Indian Kashmir region, thus abruptly increasing tensions in relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting with a heavy hand to the current protests in Egypt. It shoots live ammunition at the population, more than 2,000 detainees join the 60,000 political prisoners already held there in prisons. Protesting in Egypt has never been without danger. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, a lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi cannot get a grip on, no matter how tough it is against opponents. The situation has actually deteriorated.
Today, one in three people in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is also an old one. It always becomes critical when large parts of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
TÜV inspections in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was examined whether the complicated system network in BER fire protection works together. The operators are satisfied with the course of events. But the TÜV is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale TÜV inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport boss Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal to work through. "We have a lot of detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the timetable until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should not be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of power cable deficiencies remain to be repaired; the TÜV wants to test these until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done on the processing of the deficiencies," it said in a written message.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also still no release for all dowels on which the cable trays hang. The airport boss expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station below the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoke aprons that come down like a canvas in the event of a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, costs have risen from two billion euros to an estimated 6.5 billion euros when it opens next year.
Because passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is to be discussed at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, while personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply. There was a loss in the millions!
The police caught after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz a 33-year-old German.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into causing explosive explosions in conjunction with a particularly serious case of theft, which were led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight crimes.
The police spokesman: "With the loot, he apparently financed his narcotics addiction." Between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber blew up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße four times alone.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now in custody. The police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further vending machine explosions in Chemnitz and neighboring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is turning its strategy for Vienna Airport upside down. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa's low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto be dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. From January 2020, AUA will take over this in a "wet lease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times are to be coordinated with connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised transport out of the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for its sister company AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be served with an AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product is to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights departing under the AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in Terminal 3 like the AUA.
A price war has broken out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday to increase the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airline is sending four Ryanair planes and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "wet lease", which the union criticized as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
The challenge of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, replied on Friday AUA board member Andreas Otto: "We will remain the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: In the Italy holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have asked for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually get married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018, according to British media reports, said in the official statement.
"We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal celebration
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big celebration as Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank (33) on October 12, 2018.
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to track down the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in German-speaking countries, said the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is supporting the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the main influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - are known, it was said by the hospital. About 200 are added every year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in research into other widespread diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidneys as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the foundation's clinic in Davos has mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had undergone open-heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers who are also participating in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. In the case of genetic decodification, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, a person's genetic material can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The world's first gene sequencing, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on October 1, and all 9,000 samples should be analyzed by the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers in "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
The Koran school existed according to the information for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
There are many private Koranic schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border into neighbouring Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
Police officers have freed nearly 400 students from appalling conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children had been discovered on Thursday after a tip in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "inhumane". The officers arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were held like slaves at their school and chained. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a recognizably poor state of health.
World footballer election: Further accusations after Messi and Klopp's freestyle
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe honoured
With a gala in Milan, the world football association FIFA honours the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth award and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Player of the Year election, accusations are coming from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not counted at all - with a curious reason.
Much at FIFA has proven to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Player of the Year election has not yet been suspected of being unclean - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote more according to sympathy than objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now coming to light: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting table.
FIFA apologises that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received in exactly the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Federation simply voted on his behalf.
From the association came on Friday now the message: True, but of course was not intentional. The completed election documents had been "mistakenly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a statement from the association. But actually the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," the statement said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are now being examined by FIFA in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Until then, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer's choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out in favour of an official investigation against US President and party colleague Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established." He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures were taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he wasn't surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affair, only a few have shown unease about it. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly turned against Trump's policy, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, formally have no say in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of the legislature, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the first cracks are opening up internally among the Republicans.
The affair could lead to the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initiate a so-called impeachment. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been impeached by impeachment proceedings.
Were there torturers on board Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally headed for the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - including from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious allegations against Rackete are loud. For example, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy on the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were caught in a reception centre in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognised their tormentors in Italy. "We can not exclude that, but have no secured information," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German press Agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We can't scan who people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy's right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk Seeks Delivery Record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have a chance to hit our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said. The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla would have to mobilize as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a plus of over six percent. The price has not risen so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
US budget dispute: Again only a bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the U.S. on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and approved transitional funding until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise spending ceilings for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and approved a Continuing Resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to enact the decision.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and agencies. For the time being, therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for the new fiscal year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. The spending laws, however, reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of winning a majority.
Opinions differ above all on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion to build the wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
Opinions differ on the construction of the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to come closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November. Even a shutdown is then not excluded.
Against the backdrop of Congress's continued inability to agree on the twelve spending bills in time and the associated threat of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity. Submission p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activities of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill according to which all women can take advantage of in vitro fertilization. As a result, the demand for anonymous sperm donations is likely to increase significantly.
The bill still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children could grow up without a father". The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still prohibited
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women sued in vain for the surrender of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the initiative in Paris argued that such a child would then bear a "particularly difficult fate".
Numerous deputies of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow would be subjected to a "double mourning" if the death of her husband also left her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot father children. You must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single people or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flight tax for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. For this reason, the country also wants to have a climate levy paid there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under internal pressure.
Universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the state rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding initiative from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a teacher training college plead for compensation for business flights. This is "urgently needed" as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision, originally planned for July, is still on ice because the CDU has still not approved the Greens' proposal.
Russia Arrests North Korean Fishermen Again
According to the FSB, the detainees are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injuries, it said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters on the way. There, the coast guard of Russia drives according to its own information to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 cuttlefish seized
During the renewed checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily detained there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye region, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
Only 18,000 in the future: US lowers asylum cap
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials at the White House.
The richest country in the world is sealing itself off from those seeking protection: As confirmed by the State Department in Washington, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be lowered further. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis in particular will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be allowed into the country, the US State Department said. In the fiscal year, which is now almost over, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous administration of Barack Obama, much higher admission limits had been in place.
The target cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980. The State Department nevertheless described the US as the "most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase that is strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent US president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to allow the refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction, Trump said. For his hard line in migration policy, he gets a lot of encouragement from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had declared a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelenskyj affair and a possible threat of impeachment.
According to the State Department, the US government wants to focus on taking in two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State Department statement. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in.
The US wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this backdrop, the United States has signed migration agreements first with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
A female orangutan has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a sanctuary for great apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. Born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo, "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought on Thursday evening by direct flight to Dallas – but not as a passenger, but in the hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she will live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. It already houses 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", formerly the pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to endure a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 lawsuit brought by animal rights activists over "Sandra's" fundamental rights contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and educational institution for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000 meter high Great Pinnacle in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double bottom or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-meter-high north face of the Great Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and supported only by an absolute head for heights, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He thus beat the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August. Nike sales figures increased most strongly in China with an increase of 22 percent. As a result, the Beaverton-based company in the US state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach of addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted happily to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about professional footballer Juan Jesus of AS Roma, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifetime stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian-born defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and asked His club to take action. "@officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Roma since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He had reported the account of the fan on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter should never again visit a game of the club, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist abuse against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said at the weekend. The reason for the statement were racist chants at the first division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
But also to the supporters of Juventus Turin, there had been discussions recently. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champions Juventus Turin from stadium bans. Four of them were not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, police said. For the others, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups in the environment of Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, serious extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the investigation with a complaint last year rolling.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are behind the black market in tickets. They had "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire generations are given catchy names. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe young people's attitude to life?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, the shrimp fishing at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun officially started on September 21, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. From an ecological point of view, the city has ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started shrimp farming in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a defining industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and carefully build the service network for "permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending". In this way, the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and is using the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a flagship to support smart high-end manufacturing companies, biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection companies, cultural and health industries, and organic farms that are leaders in the "3+2" sector.  to settle here. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the establishment of a national tourism zone covering all areas and tourist destinations of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape have been integrated, the condition of the buildings for citizen services and public services has been comprehensively improved, the "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" sectors have been vigorously developed and the development of cultural tourism has been promoted at a high level of quality. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Rouhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had promised an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Rouhani describes the events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," Rouhani added. The nature of the punitive measures that should be ended was up for debate. "And they have clearly said we will lift all sanctions."
However, this initiative was not made in an acceptable way, criticized Rouhani. Given the punitive measures in place and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the fear of a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - worn down by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that have been registered as places of refuge in the centre have long since been built up. As recently as the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the quake on Thursday was in the Sea of Marmara off the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as the disaster control authority Afad announced. A few minutes later, a smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not initially been reported. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for safety reasons. Some students were crying, as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly prone to earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian tectonic plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people lost their lives.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies draw up contingency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake will come, is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after returning from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were lost. It was more violent than Tuesday's, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is given as 13:59 (local time). Just minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock, according to CNN Turkey, which was given a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now an early warning. It had become more likely, he told CNN Turk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later, the big quake will come."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth also shook at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New explosive material in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new explosive material in the Ukraine affair to possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President contain important clues for investigations against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt". He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight has been diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
In an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be freed from the narrow cabin. She was locked up in it for about an hour, US media wrote, citing other passengers. For the onward flight in the direction of San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video circulated on the Internet, which, according to US media, is said to come from Flight 1554, several people can be seen trying to free the woman. "We're working right now to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Metamorphosis", the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published on November 27 on German, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined not to let anything or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions beg the catastrophe of a no-deal – then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write". McEwan's novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence was published in the spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a monstrous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that is upside down," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are equipped with whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU's infrastructure fund "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including 31 October 2019 one day after filing for insolvency. Travel could "not be started for insolvency reasons," the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin that have already been paid in advance or paid in full. As it stands to trips starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was caught up in the maelstrom of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels again from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that currently still accommodate Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not required to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise coerced from now on," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company was responding to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected, will be coordinated on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured the holidays and return journeys of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are currently still on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31 would be canceled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands to trips starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich Insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. Dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers can find out about possibilities of refunding the travel price on the Kaera website and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa, he is now following in the footsteps of his mother.
Wearing a blue splinter vest, Britain's Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circle on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk in the town of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same demolition master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to cover the path she walked at that time. The pictures of Princess Diana walking through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Faltering Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly decided: With him, there will be no third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But which statements are already of eternal duration with the polarizing Briton. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blond. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to stubbornly carry out his Brexit course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week. And a law passed by parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks until October 31 in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically ruled this out again and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson noticeably. Meanwhile, during a visit to a hospital, he hinted that he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October if no agreement was reached:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And preferably with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the latest talks have not achieved a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. But the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson could somehow push through Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authority: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injured in this context, said the US health authority CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 sufferers, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fears of new protests in Egypt are growing
Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times on online networks. In it, the building contractor and actor, who lives in Spain, calls for a "people's revolution". Today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence has already been observed in central Cairo. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were closed. In recent days, the police had already stepped up their street checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians, some of them for messages and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces reacted correspondingly harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW said, citing lawyers of detainees.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to the report, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and sometimes sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by, among others, skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
Together with a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place behind closed doors," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and marine litter. During the expedition, among other things, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished for microplastics with nets, it was said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "Arved Fuchs is a great role model for all of us who care about the survival of the oceans," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: That seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases damage Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," said a spokesman for Federagit, the association of tourist guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Promptly came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not apparent from the invoice. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
One phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of recent days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible – there is talk of weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is allegedly the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and the democracy of the USA, is monstrous: The president had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He had exploited Ukraine's dependence for blackmail and thus wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The essence of this project can also be understood in the now published transcript of the conversation with Zelenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full wording. But the July 25 phone call is only one episode in a much larger story, at the center of which, in addition to Trump, is above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Zelenskyi, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation, which we have the right to do," he told the newspaper. You might think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal about it." Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is little basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is about exactly the investigations that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Zelenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, had pushed for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. In order to stop his investigation into the gas company, on whose board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Shokin himself was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, and the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has been not loading since about 3:30 p.m. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services were down for several hours. And as in previous cases, users are mainly resorting to Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in a rubber dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - it took the Chilean rescue helicopter less than an hour to recover.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, we started shortly before ten, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: NEVER charge your smartphone wirelessly
Convenient, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature clogs battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With wireless charging, however, the researchers always measured over 30 degrees, even if the smartphone was perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last as long overall. The service life is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of a battery replacement even once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious plug fiddling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which even Apple participates exceptionally, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer claims to have climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition operator said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines once: he took a photo of climbers queuing up on Mount Everest, which went viral in spring.
The image of the crowds triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One of the reasons given for this is bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, said a police spokesman on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous former rock fortress Sigiriya, visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals migrate through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically punishable by death.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being seized by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Administration, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the British-flagged tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook under criticism
The responsible economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It should be about the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not want to help the struggling company financially. "Our interest is in the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors," said committee chair Rachel Reeves in London. "Apparently, we are dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla would have to mobilize as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a plus of over six percent. The price has not risen so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Does the British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson cautious
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law against a no-deal Brexit recently passed by Parliament. In response to a question on Friday, he told journalists only that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU.
"We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31, and the best way is with a deal."
Iran apparently ramps up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European contracting parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they did not stand by their promises, he held out the prospect of "further steps" away from the agreements of the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US single-handedly withdrew from the agreement in 2018 in order to use "maximum pressure" to force Iran to change course in its Middle East policy, which is considered aggressive. The administration of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again relying on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by restarting uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least has prepared them for use. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore leave the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of onerous US sanctions, Rouhani speculated. Nevertheless, there will be further talks, which hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation changed after an attack on an important oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had claimed responsibility for the attack, but this was interpreted by the US as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rouhani reiterated his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders could not have done that in their talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they only claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration must first be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from another star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was only possible once. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest is cruising through our solar system. The comet from deep space was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a homemade telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be spotted during a passage of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get a close-up look at an alien solar system before it disappears never to be seen again. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa reported in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on approach. This leaves the researchers many months for investigations. "The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to be 2 to 16 kilometers in a first study. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to study certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such flying visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be intercepted by a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency (ESA).
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (german comet interceptors) on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. According to ESA science director Günther Hasinger, it should either lie in wait for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the time has come: A first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, the new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually, and by 2025 it should already be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion euro project. China's latest prestige project is also called "starfish" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automated air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and is much smaller - has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: From London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of. This flight, which is targeted for the 2030s, is to be made possible at supersonic speed by a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is being developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely do that," agency chief Graham Turnock told the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the cessation of operations in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident during the take-off of a Concorde at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, killing all 109 occupants. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US space agency Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transportation," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - five times faster than sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, enabling the "next generation of truly reusable framecraft".
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the US legation to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and such people had been treated "a little differently" in the past than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tipsters. The event was actually not public. However, several US media outlets circulated audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official, who raises serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. Due to great public pressure, the descriptions of the whistleblower were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government employees that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the 2020 US election in his favour.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: Senior government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under wraps. As usual, an electronic verbatim protocol had been drawn up. After the conversation, however, this was removed from a database usually provided for this purpose on the instructions of lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no tipsters or spies.
How Trump expressed himself in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower, but triggered outrage. The Chairman of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with concern and complained that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been running for months in various committees. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with investigations with new force in order to set in motion a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accusing him of misrepresenting things and again calling for the committee chairman to resign. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and foreign policy sector, the majority of whom worked under Democratic, but also under Republican presidents, backed the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible impeachment procedure in a statement published on Friday. Should the allegations prove true, it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initiate a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been impeached by impeachment proceedings.
VW works council: Jobs are being cut "gradually"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved as early as this year.
One key to this is personnel costs. The "pact for the future" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be cut at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment will be secured until 2029.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which would not actually be up for grabs, are being "creepingly" cut in another way - i.e. bypassing the official course. For example, regular vacancies are often not refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the replacement. In the meantime, there is a shortage of personnel in many places, the intensification of work is increasing, and concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants are increasing. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume will take place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Board Member for Production Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
There have already been successes in this direction: this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle will fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on October 24, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper, it is around the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW's internal rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built there annually for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the load factor in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to falling diesel demand and the problems with the changeover to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
As Board Member for Production Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll off the assembly line in Wolfsburg "in the future". This should make it possible to bundle Golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is handing over Golf production by converting it to a location for electric car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales figures for the Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, it should remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburg-based company for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: Human trafficker convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to suspended sentences and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest while they were still at home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in rubber dinghies with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Once in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Their wages were therefore completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women to brothels during the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the sentencing. "Some were really disgusted."
The sentences are on commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and serious forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants' union Ufo has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on October 14 about the industrial action in the LH Group," UFO collective bargaining board member Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have refused for months to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO. It is also about the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, UFO now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labor Court. Lufthansa wanted to have it determined that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering appealing against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think is unlikely," said UFO board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurt Regional Labor Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by the courts. The company argues that the union has not appointed a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the sectoral union, in the course of which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. Because of doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended an already begun ballot on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not exactly been known as an international tourist magnet. But this is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa requirements.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the aim is to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Khatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually issued only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed drastically, and oil prices shot up. It is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to return to its old levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos, in which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including banana-printed suits, on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry in church next weekend.
The Biebers tied the knot a year ago in a New York registry office. There had not been a bigger celebration at that time.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey explained that after initial problems, the two had found common ground: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a wooded area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had given a distress signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also used in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. She examined the populations of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and thus on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "critically endangered", "critically endangered" and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Mountain ash and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, especially mountain ash (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German press Agency. "Most are threatened because populations are small anyway or by the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "vulnerable" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. In addition to a fungus, the biggest threat is the Balkan leaf miner moth. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 individuals. Trees in cities, parks and avenues are not taken into account in this assessment.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists established new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails play a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europa Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. There were no deaths, according to the information. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly prone to earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian tectonic plates.
One of the most severe quakes was one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people lost their lives.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform on the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show of the next American football final, the Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It doesn't get any bigger," Shakira captioned a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, the time will come in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira said in a statement that she was honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and around the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" stand together on stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have fallen in audience numbers recently: This February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
Around the halftime show of the last Super Bowl, there had been uproar in the run-up: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism on the knees. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been without a club since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dearly. There is a threat of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its edition on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make write-downs of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (around 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report. This was shown by estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Bondholders would have to accept write-downs of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders between £550 million and £825 million. The actual amounts to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the ranges, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will become apparent after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not exude too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook's approximately 40 aircraft in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor locations. The most money could probably be made with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it was said.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can not rule it out, but we ourselves have no reliable information," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news Agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception center in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants into the port of Lampedusa on June 29, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are said to have arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
US warns German government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the German government against trusting the Chinese network equipment supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," Pai told Handelsblatt with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security organs.
Current law also prohibits companies from notifying third parties of such requests," the FCC chief continued. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The German government has now agreed to require suppliers to issue a "declaration of trustworthiness".
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure is opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told Handelsblatt.
The US had evidence that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the US position.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire lights up the sky above a chemical plant in northern France. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, said the responsible prefecture. The Ministry of the Interior had urged citizens to stay in buildings as much as possible and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no casualties. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals indoors, protect their feed and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that smell will spread after deletion, the prefecture said on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the scene of the fire.
A gigantic column of black smoke had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso, Italy, near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had initially been found in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine cannot be ruled out. In the river, dams had been built against the pollution, said the prefecture.
The fire broke out in the early morning around 02.40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the euro zone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We cannot wait until the economic situation deteriorates to take the necessary decisions."
Those states that have budgetary leeway for more investment would have to act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have this leeway, the minister added, referring to his country's high public debt. This amounts to more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced," Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
This is the French government's response, among other things, to the protests of the yellow vest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson dodges question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the "capitulation law" passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile about whether he wants to push through an unregulated Brexit – despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which is intended to prevent exactly that. In response to a question, Johnson told journalists only that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit. "We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31, and the best way is with a deal."
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he felt the political disputes over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the desired EU exit would still come about: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave (editor's note: from the EU), do not worry," Cummings told the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as chief strategist at Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Illustrious guests also included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of Linda McCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
For Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always with her. She has made thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, there is always one person in the spotlight: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, makes phone calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears misshapen moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that as a baby she slept in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it hasn't always been tidy with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," Paul McCartney said. "If you take a photo two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing just the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but is also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey could not cut off oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey was having problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues," said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear deal with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not abiding by the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict admission of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The US State Department said on Thursday that the annual cap on a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said the U.S. remains committed to supporting refugees. The most important task, however, is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on taking in two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are in danger as a result, according to the State Department statement. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in.
Launched in 1980, the program selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted horrified to the announced lowering of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would further damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - both legally and illegally. The US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Comes close to a spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has given the informant who accuses him of abuse of power appropriate clues, "comes close to a spy," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is reported by several US media outlets.
Accordingly, Trump spoke in front of employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied: "That's close to a spy." Then Trump added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Correct. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers interpreted the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceedings against him, wrote the chairmen of the committees on foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the President in a now published complaint of having abused his office to ask for interference from another country in the US election in 2020. Specifically, it is, among other things, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested to him to initiate investigations against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are. As the New York Times reports, however, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Again and again, people try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often much too small boats capsize regularly. The sinking of a rubber dinghy has now killed seven migrants – including five children.
Off the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants have died in the sinking of a rubber dinghy. Among the fatalities were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek coast guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants originate. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are crossing over to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in boats that are far too small. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The Who cancel concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an ailment of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it while it's still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "really can't speak now." Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money's worth at a reparation concert. However, a date has not yet been set.
Performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver cancelled The Who. They are to be made up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band was formed 55 years ago.
Rental Suddenly: WeWork Makes Real Estate Markets Trembl
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rose from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company dismissed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and began selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports, among others, that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. This means that the largest tenant of office space in New York and London, among others, is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office space on a long-term basis and rents it out to members on a short-term basis, sometimes in small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of $1.6 billion, on revenue of $1.8 billion. This year, rental costs alone are said to have risen to an estimated $2.5 billion due to the rental of ever new large spaces. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has leased nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, over the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space that came onto the market during this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office vacancy rate in the US metropolis would have risen during this time, as Alpert wrote in Business Insider. The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in prime locations.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, which was bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have remodeled their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, property owners would probably have to write off part of the billions in revenue they had hoped for. They do not have access to WeWork's - already scarce - reserves despite the long-term leases. This is because the leasing of the individual WeWork locations is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is liable only within narrow limits.
Russia again detained numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again cracked down on North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of another 262 poachers have been arrested who have fished illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told Interfax on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters on the way. There, the coast guard of Russia drives according to its own information to protect their marine biological resources patrols. During the renewed controls, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti agency, the Coast Guard detected a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018
The Russian fisheries authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye region, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose. The ships themselves also do not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian coast guard were injured in the arrests in the previous week. A North Korean, who was also wounded, later died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards detained one North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
US imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The US State Department justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and the use of force to prop up the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump had issued on Wednesday travel bans, among other things, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a series of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of seconded doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. Because of the time difference, New Zealand and Australia are likely to make the beginning before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Protesters also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How big the worldwide popularity will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg herself was in good spirits. "Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the influx last Friday was very large. A good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - had taken part in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had sat down in August 2018 in front of the Swedish Parliament to call on the politicians of her country to a stronger commitment to climate protection. Within a short time, the Fridays for Future movement emerged from this. The climate protests mainly involve school and university students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be contained to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week transatlantic trip on an ocean-going racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke forcefully to the conscience of the heads of state and government of the world. In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on balconies. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the emergency Ministry on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Agency Tass. The ban is due to come into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should start a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - investigators dig up servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time excavated a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the General Prosecutor's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major operation. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market" – investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
Such a hoster had been excavated for the first time in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there had been searches in Germany and neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl, of all people, holds the mirror in front of the noses of the power mongers of this time. But what's behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made a trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a downside to this? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely thanks to her daughter in the spotlight. Even well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own in the media worldwide and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
This is where opinions differ: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially by saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest cruises through our solar system
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a homemade telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be spotted in transit.
The big opportunity for astronomers now is to catch a glimpse of an alien solar system up close. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers can observe it in depth. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on its approach, which means it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered in just two years may allow a new way of studying certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids occupy the researchers. Just recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonelier. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister castigates the bellicose language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm himself - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was met with massive indignation from the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of leaving the EU should be "hanged, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered". She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who ran in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
She was particularly offended by the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, was mentioned. Their memory could best be honored by pulling through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to an MP who was murdered by someone who shouted 'Britain first'," Johnson's sister said. The perpetrator had obviously come from the right-wing extremist camp, which felt strengthened "by this kind of language". For all those who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like that," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to stand up passionately and decisively for what you believe in – no matter what view you believe. But one should never "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. "In recent months, I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it's an irresolvable tension," Jo Johnson said.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language, which is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they said: "In recent days, language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should talk to each other with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is sending a strong signal: In the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots will perform. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming finals of the US football league NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I am incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo. Because it has incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The finals of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th anniversary next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on stage — and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in German cinemas from November in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough came in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the halftime guests is eagerly awaited in the USA every time. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least because of President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL finals, and it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, there were political controversies in the run-up. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise while playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and had been harshly attacked by US President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had declined a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 performed was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and YouTuber is attacking Egypt's rulers: For the time being, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who influence whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them returned to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and did not say a single word about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to  to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry," Sisi said at the airport into the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians will not be misled."
According to the president, this is what the other man who currently determines what is happening on the streets is trying to mislead. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escaped the grasp of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to set foot on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and has magnificent new palaces built, it says. Ali accuses the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a building contractor, he seems to know pretty much what he is talking about - at least that's the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding number of clicks show.
After thousands demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi's seizure of power and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million-dollar march" this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture onto the streets. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. Initially, these videos could not be independently verified. From security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansoura in the Nile Delta, where protesters tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the arterial roads. In Cairo, several metro stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance" work, and most streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood Morsi barricaded themselves in 2013 until the army fired on them and killed up to 800 people, another measure was intended to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a large rally for the president here.
These precautions prompted Mohamed Ali to change his tactics: "Our destination does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said into his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." However, this should not be understood as a retreat: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed specifications of the providers. In the event of abnormalities, customers can check for themselves how much of this is actually achieved.
After all, the previously promised transmission rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer center Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. For example, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the Bavarian Consumer Center on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable deadline of usually 14 days to provide the promised service. This is best done by those affected in writing by registered mail.
If this does not work even after repeated requests, customers can terminate the contract and, under certain circumstances, also claim damages. But in the absence of success, only the legal action helps.
First Senior Republican for Investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken out in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established," Phil Scott said at a press conference Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures - impeachment proceedings can lead to the removal of the president - are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Because Trump is watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump because of the whistleblower affair; few have shown any unease about this. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump's policies, including relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several US media outlets. Accordingly, the theatrical release should already be fixed: In the USA, the film is to start from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path in the MCU continues. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are thrilled that we can continue to work on this... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how did the sudden good news come about? Allegedly, Sony is said to have made Marvel an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also owns Marvel, would participate with 30 percent of the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked for many years in the series, was paid tribute in a charming way. Warning, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
First of all: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some flashbacks once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she greets him after serving his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in passing in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown on a frock coat, the baffled Harvey wants to know from the groom, only to then snippily remark: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
When a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children drowned. A total of seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coast guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants are crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced his intention to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to find out in Turkey "how the refugee situation stands," Seehofer said on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help them cope.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer's planned trip with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece continues to receive an unusually high number of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people crossed over to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants who enter the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
However, the processing of asylum applications is making slow progress on the Greek side due to a lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are holding out on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The situation is worst on Lesvos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 have there been so many, reported the state radio.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "certainly" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system was affected by high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to increased heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, the elderly and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo glitch
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally attracted attention. Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens, has never held the reusable coffee mug with a metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and also distributed to the media - and then the cup was still a disdainful (cardboard) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green leader has to answer for photo glitch
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which Trudeau is also having an increasingly difficult time because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media, fueling discussion about fake news. One user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their leader to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and asserted on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, talking to citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she corrected, it was made of bamboo. She always has him with her. A spokeswoman for the party said it was only about putting the party logo in the picture, not to cover up anything. Only a section of the photo can be seen on the website.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did so. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian and at the same time asked her over-committed team: "If they feel like editing a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also gotten into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. The leader of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with a plastic spoon on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng had been assured by mail from Cathay Pacific an upgrade. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for Business Class - that's what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they're lucky, and check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng has more than 65,000 followers on Instagram. She flew from Taiwan to New York on May 30 and back on June 7.
On the outbound flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had shown an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised her an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the letter from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having forged the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they followed up with headquarters. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly originates is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now calls in a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar within a very short time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the price slide was a report in the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in mid-September brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill. The Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in the civil war country Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, it could focus on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg.
Oil prices are thus continuing their downward movement of recent days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Most recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original amount.
Recently, there have been several press reports, citing insiders who report rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there were signs of some easing in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leaving the port more than two months after it was seized by Iran and recently cleared. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping company boss Erik Hånell told Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would deploy defensive missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy in Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the USA and Great Britain had driven up oil prices significantly at times in recent weeks.
Allegations against Trump intensify
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees had made intensive efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of a "cover-up". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that there will soon be a third summit between leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to a lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized tougher US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. He hoped, however, on a "wise" and "courageous" decision of Trump, so that it comes back to a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed to it. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two met in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help with mine clearance
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, Britain's Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he made the ignition circle. The explosive device exploded at a safe distance. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which have not helped to clear away, to commit to help."
Pound under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an imminent interest rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation on an imminent interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is affecting the pound sterling. The British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders. He raised the possibility of cutting interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising because Saunders is considered an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of brokerage ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the burden on the economy by the Brexit hickhack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on October 31, if necessary without a divorce agreement.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Association of Athletics Federations.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy what little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even rudimentarily. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was exposed. As a result, Wada banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes from the country compete under a neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, and 168 Russian athletes competed at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the Football World Cup took place in Russia with the host as a participant.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data Wada received from a whistleblower and the data it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which had been mentioned in the McLaren Report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation is the only organization to adhere to Russia's ban. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training and undergoing tests outside the Russian system.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations in the room and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatened with the renewed ban of Rusada and, in the worst case, exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
