Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly amicable.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal on Iran's nuclear program, which was advertised by Obama, has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress, which was considered partly an affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon told Lamb in a somewhat shaky voice to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" but was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scrawled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was in the letter, according to the authorities, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff members heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the fateful emergency call at some point after.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police encircled him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get an idea of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching staff includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some propensities to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online classes.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to hire as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing campus, police later found Lamb's lane when he entered Mississippi from Arkansas again.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coronar Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime girlfriends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her how to play the guitar for a few years.
He was the women's crush at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no deed from a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one gig or another together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he was Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night 5. September saw for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight memorial service on Tuesday night, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that in his distress call, Prentiss, referred to as his wife, but there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed by him a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In the Christmas period in 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royals, and I notice the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to mind that I'm a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "undisputedly the biggest time-travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select cinemas in October.
U.N. chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief is once again calling on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent member nations -- the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France -- on the sidelines of the general assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the splits in the council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper ranks at polls, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain, none of which even won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's stamina and starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view from Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers are holding in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Even so, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temper doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters consider Trump to be real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change since when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans were rallying around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, ahead of Walker 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinions.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly awarded their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their minds.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as likely for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapist" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the lynchpin in the public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep crucial Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they match Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do the same.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now out of support for around half of the support of Republican voters, mostly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday poll they'd rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly upset."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea watt.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," the study says - so the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student stall in Munich is not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places of residence, however, the price seems like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here for once.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goalscorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A confident kick-off of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start success in series is to take the first step towards the final on 28. May 2016 be in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
Müller received at his 28th. Hits in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership kind help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let a shot of the world champion intended as a flank pass.
"We're not going to underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised ahead of the match at Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and Munich kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus had won its most recent six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled here.
Yet Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously approached, but often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by relocation to left-back Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Brunswick's Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left corner.
In the 67. Minute the world champion awarded the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown knocked the pole's header off the line (26th).
Then by direct delivery, the goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35.).
Although Bayern raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put pinpricks.
Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was relied on.
For example, when he steered a shot from Ideye over the bar (56.).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a chain of four with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer on "Sky": "If you want to make something different out of it, that is already malicious".
Guardiola also decided against him on the first change when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the ailing Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another one on it by penalty.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly masked Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported out of the stadium injured.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: If given up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take over ten years for the risk to drop back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
People must be persuaded to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous research would have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists come across remains from late antiquity on Cologne's banks of the Rhine
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always called in as a specialist office for archaeological soil monument preservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that at the point in 4. Century a fortress and in the 8. Century have stood a church, Trier explained.
In addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman has crashed at the station in ­Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks coming from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the Federal Police, she has sustained serious injuries from it.
She was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigating officials have no knowledge of the reason for the nightly crossing of the track of the young woman.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or local residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information that provides information about the cause of the accident can be given at the round the clock and free hotline of the Federal Police on telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said the European Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings specifically stipulate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are said to be in equal parts of the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow objection to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS), which are mainly required by large corporations, are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, derail national laws or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
Above all, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform, which German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the economy's lawsuits through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) agreement can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date is no longer tenable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at Cologne's Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost gripped by Steven's talk.
He tells stories on the basis of various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, about which his meticulturally and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
Released in 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which nestle harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens performs here.
Live guitar and banjo are enough for him.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise", a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released in 2005.
Exuberant in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing from any annual leaderboard of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offset pieces.
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and reverberation.
Long since the smaller clubs have been born, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark hamburger More!
Theater mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests now sit here spellbound in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-ranging album.
From the audience you can hear: The lecture is "opulent" and you can "basically throw away the plate".
Only to an encore does Stevens express his modest thanks, acoustically plays few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the prime minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited
New Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is due to make his debut at the prime minister's Question Time and mess with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be audited by the media and the Labour MP up close.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he can skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman's decision, on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th, has made. Anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain silent, provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and takes centre stage in several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "Heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, invoking differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally backed him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "piling up" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is putting forward changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-labour and pensions minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron since he has been Tory's chief executive over the last decade across the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "slapping" and arguing with barbs and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow of Economy Minister will represent him if he does not attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he has approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theatre" that is often linked to the prime minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he acknowledged that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless youths trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough-tough place to be homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises from accelerated wage growth in UK
The pound jumped up after data showing a rise in UK wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings excluding bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market, making a 20% jump after rivals' takeover offer, AB InBev, received.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it was 2.5 billion. $ has taken through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decline after Goldman Sachs put his assessment for the company Rating on "selling."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppische 21 years young, a chick with an upper-sensed hairdress.
The type with the platinum-blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is freaking out.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here lives their idol, whose posters are attached in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says: "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the 10th grade in high school."
“I fulfill a dream for her.”
School compulsory?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Neither did Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the Superbowl's commercial break, he conceded three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and walks across the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is, after all, at number 1 in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least that's how he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato kebab idea
Potatoes or kebabs?
Both work - in the potato kebab, which the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
He was inspired by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, a barbecue skewer has been spinning in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculturalism for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the patent office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
How much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains, Alhay does not want to reveal.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches down-to-earth campaign to combat Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earth campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA distributors and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough distributing samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to provide further details of its defense strategy on the 29th. September published when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store deals and generating higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch away around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mostly to Aldi and Coles, though a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a Melbourne business lunch that Metcash is likely within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is expected that a board member of Metcash made contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction while putting pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster-growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label food.
Metcash's chief executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will gain steam and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of Australian tennis federation Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," came into the spotlight by Kyrgios' infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a convulsion thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I'm quite jealous of is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was drawn a little into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he has been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term permanent component."
"First, we wish the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick managed the climb very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight where he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the squad and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, withholds refugees
Hungary declares a state of emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, holding on to all those who tried to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter floated above them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Talks will have to take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serb border failed to agree on a joint immigration policy a day after the 28-nation bloc at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the surprised Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an action soon from Brussels or from its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block off roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arriving are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot)-high fence, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged said.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to agree procedurally to the deployment of the military, which is expected to last next week, but Associated Press reporters have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country's security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and squeezed a crowd to crowd in there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia's and Hungarians' main highway link, saying they would deny food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, will receive support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the primaries begin, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say their opinion is determined which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in her election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news poll, Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but those protrusions have diminished.
Their support among the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some caveats and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are mostly excited about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently don't support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so about their front-runner Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked on an open-ended question about why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval of dealing with the problems and electability are also cited.
With the vice president throwing a potential for presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be her second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race, is up.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in that measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most electable" has risen.
Still, when asked what's more important to a candidate, Democratic voters are citing questions about electability.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters of the primaries.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some key features among voters in their party's primary.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best on honesty on the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion on it.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server during the tenure as secretary of state continue to be asked, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on her general opinions from Clinton, though 36 percent said her opinion of her had still deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say their views have gotten worse from Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best on honesty.
A majority see Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates, meanwhile, account for half of voters' support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing support
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support is growing by 27% in the latest CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot up from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, is knocked off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls - landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind which Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking ahead to a rising Carson last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: The water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, it even comes up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the peak 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college freshman
Nearly two years after a student passed away during a bullying ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to walk across a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call emergency number 911 after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, according to police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with dull force injuries to the head, trunk and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died of harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two Brotherhood members, including Mr Meng, are also charged with bullying attacks and forming a criminal association.
"We not only want to hold the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will also hold these to account," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the house is simmering, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will all last and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance to the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so fiercely emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather to the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated because of a rate hike.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of "cheap money,"" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean there will be no impact.
Here’s a look based on historical trends at how some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a tendency for asset income to be choked off 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after interest rate hikes by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is mostly on the uptrend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, quite flat in the 250 days after that (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield is starting to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950 have only twice been nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared for a Fed rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to the present have taken place in a supercycle with increasing momentum in GDP and dwarfed pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with equities, if they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields appear to be changing direction once the first increase/lowering occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe the rise in interest rates will cause yields to move closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often yield better yields in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about expecting higher yields," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
What is interesting, Jones thinks, is that the markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have widened and volatility has risen - all features of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater share of their business in the U.S. will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how fast that will take place.

BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, a leading member of parliament claims, ramping up new pressure on the broadcaster to prove he is doing something the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was "dumbing down" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appear to be The Brits just under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously cited examples where you're actually just imitating what's already in the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn anywhere else about classical music.
And there's a commitment to live music and music making that's really unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works, I also really think is important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less aware of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire to kick the commercial rivals on their feet during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated cost £22m.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - starring Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in a special BBC way."
He added that he wishes the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe Black Friday in November has curbed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
Yet experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new numbers showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnant after new numbers indicated just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, starting as buyers make purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. B. at home on the sofa.
But now that's commuting, and we'll possibly see growth decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the slackening sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average number of shoppers gathered around their computers five times to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought each other because of bargains, could discourage buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 issues, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried those killed in Mecca in crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse in part of the giant Saudi bin-shop group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's grand mosque.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead began their last journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the Holy Site, where only days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were cleared for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the Bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left behind 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Grand Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin-shop group shouldn't have left the crane's arm standing when it wasn't used.
An Arab version of the decree released by the state-owned Saudi Press Agency said the bin-shop group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report this detail but said foreign travel was prohibited from running the company.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered outside the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The bin-Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for non-current security measures and because it had not cooperated with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the bin-shop group.
The Bin Laden family has been affiliated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same sum of permanent injuries.
Other injured people receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has seen an increase
That causes 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen to open
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Brits are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to belong to a minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the company's chief executive behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the hardware store chain, said a huge increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices has now been outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B&Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men outweigh the staff.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that feature more female single households that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our stores.
We need to shift this more to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect on an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has filled exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials on trial for infidelity
At the regional court in Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball runner-up Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used funds from association accounts over which they were allowed to schedule in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offenses.
This fact was eliminated by the chairwoman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is due to be negotiated at a later date.
On the dismissal of infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time incurred a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials would have only offset expenses and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (r. 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Do we continue to run the club or do we lock it up?" one of the defendants, in the bread profession, told the tax office's large-scale auditors.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money, put down our life insurance as collateral at the bank," he said on the survey.
It was agreed with the association: You can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
Furthermore, if financial success is appropriate, the payment of the expense allowances was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the expense allowances were paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus in the account had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed debits seemed to be open, the former chairman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts had not been disclosed in detail to the association, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the financial confession in detail, only the debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When investigations for abuse of office began in 2011 against the one official, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to its testimony.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer to this for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This referral was formulated as "damage compensation."
Why injury indemnity?, Judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then declared that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all off the hook with him."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a penny salary, he had only charged mileage money and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not provide exact documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correct, they explained.
Mileage money had also been received by the second defendant.
All fixes were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will be on 23. September with the questioning of witnesses continued.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reductions that have been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs in the splitting of the company.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This is intended to cost 2.7 billion. Dollar (2.4 billion) Euro) will be saved, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will become a special burden of around 2.7 billion. Run dollars that will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
HP still employed approximately 302,000 at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
After-hours, Hewlett-Packard shares gave up 2.3 percent.
The printer-brought-up group from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: This year, the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both divisions are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services recently added to the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third fiscal quarter at the end of July, sales of PC and printers declined by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under 25.4 billion. Dollars.
This reduced revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.

24 percent oppose interfering in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent could not decide.

Röszke: Outbreak of violence at Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannon against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the policemen stood a water cannon ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers.
Officials initially used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police press officers also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half, who still believed last week that the Fed would do so, now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's been a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed's interest rates bet on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may be leaving the zero range and a process of normalizing interest rates is starting," said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
Death gunman at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say he was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center staff that police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house but who "will not disturb anyone," but will probably be excited.
Police asked the caller by his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb did not give an explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person."
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said that Prentiss was their daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to testimony from Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been meeting with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them "he is not going to jail."
When police officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a gunshot.
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life time indicates on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is also reportedly grappling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this is certainly taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is remodeling the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1000 executives will cost the Group’s restructuring a job.
There are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is a contribution to earnings of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team led by CEO Carsten Spohr in the future.
With the reorganization, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employee company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilots' association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to resume after the court-stopped strike this Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
The topic of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come to sustainable results "in one year with a projected record result" as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the "Wings" savings concept.
It envisages Lufthansa outsourcing routes to the Group's own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-back cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th Minute caused after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then that takes six months, and he's not going to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee had been mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has an added incentive to recover by next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the court, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland squad at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's having a very hard time because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you almost know it by heart.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's SuperCamps website, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my kids, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content indication of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, was completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough yet: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of that of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database's website, beginning: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book's plot. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment being ravaged by the money-greedy, trees-slashing, thread-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, mustache creature "that speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was delivered by Cameron's staff but gave no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's squad, but it's still hard
Coming across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England have chosen for the Tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the ones three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth is out of the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are geared towards results.
There was no question mark on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, the run of Lyth would have been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hopefully strikes out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance is coming.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his stance, even if he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man in particular.
The question of how much time a test batsman will get to make his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only accusation one can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but that lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman I highly value.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us a lot.
He must get at least the same chances as the one before him, but this, of course, depends on the team lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, popped up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batsman can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown he's a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for her, and there's not much difference there.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He immediately managed three hundred runs and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited handling of him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may be looking at his stats -- averagely 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a punt, but there's not a big number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the squad, England have made a few smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He's one of the game's nicest guys who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful effort to the setup.
I've always felt that he's created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.
Colly's team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not deployed at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team displays do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of the UK from the EU) could gain inflow if the economy falls into a slack by 2017
David Cameron's inferior renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with each passing day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, which fiercely crushed because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European friend of diplomats said the other day that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own fault, Britain’s own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they usually do not want, are full.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime minister and finance ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes a British woman looking outside inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
Germany's cautiously level-headed Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long-standings such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks ahead to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a leftist.
It's hard to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the selfie-brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Britain has not gained any of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press baron is, but it was not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Arch-Euro-Opportunist, who made a name for himself as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing rogues, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-inlanders who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that when you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you'd better hand out bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum swirl, because Blair had put the principle above the unpassed constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which thus opened a back door for him.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-colored tendency and the wilder climes of Tory's Little Englishmanism, arguably anyone can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary's "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and on television this week, when the Boy Scout in him did not admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father, on television, struggled to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contestants and MPs after all the reports at their closing session on Monday night.
Whatever the touchy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the swirl of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities on EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small-scale difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is rock-so since JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of something that British Influence Security Forum called itself.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, in part with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarette report.
PHE published the "Principle Report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
Yet some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the present best estimate that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) analysis to lead their opinions on the harms of different nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references on public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he is said to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports before, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research work "concedes, indicatively," that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low by comparison, but that we continue to have the long-term implications to study.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion. £ per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up on EastEnders, says former chief executive of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast through other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-service programmes, likely seen by a smaller audience, into hard-fought time slots against the most popular shows by their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC director-generate, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or broadcasts programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the upper house communications committee as part of his investigation into the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others do not or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class window of opportunity because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funds programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Frankly, other channels would give her right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes should "go to BBC4, where you can't pretty much measure the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window of opportunity where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions on who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think you get a great value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example at public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in "informing, enlightening and entertaining."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, which he said only a handful are shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters forming alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brains of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms in such a way that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the changed motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The ads are shaming Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Watch trade show video.
Terrible murderer drones!
Ankle crushing leg restraints!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to put the British government's willingness to put weapons on repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains, which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Drive from 15 to 18. September with DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you can read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which is transformed into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving DLR ... Customers are asked to help with the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys claimed to be "accessing around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to venture outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trading posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertisement for the arms fair - through a blank space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy corporate advertising, but "by inflating with bright colors and animation, it remains more strong."
"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the field within ExCeL, where exhibitors are fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army about "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still in faith in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous, long-breathed complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-racking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell where you're from, if and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes caught on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
People's rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues and communal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and right their underwear.
Related to this: Do not think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I get back the energy I've used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by conviviality - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you start university at the height of the baking mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce themselves with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Offering home-made treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to entertain and may eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sit down when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the dairy owner.
Chances are they say to serve themselves, even when they are cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a dish soap to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that you are literally one of the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they cared a bit, to put drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before letting her own music blare, closing her door and embarking on her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student residence?
Conversely, it wouldn't be abysmally embarrassing if you thought of a roommate for your future spouse, get close to her, break up again and then see her every day and maybe witness her pull all the mutual friends over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to tell your abdomen a little sense.
The exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments before he becomes a boomerang.
By hiding, teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never mess up anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but do not tackle your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the Middle Franconian valley for people who do not have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," the 44-year-old says in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner thinks he knows how quickly cheaper housing can be created: He builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I have done my project correctly.
It is always particularly complicated by the looming sword of Damocles Sonderbau and the parking space ordinance.
Scary.
It is still assumed who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you tighten the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True: We have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Releases
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then choosing "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message that indicates that the "software update has failed".
To get around the issue, users are advised to either wait until the onslaught goes back or try to update through iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That may possibly mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or located near a charger, so the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a cancellation of the update.

You should also make sure that you’ve looked through our checklist of all things before you download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself in case they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and fix the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The World Cup runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races "that I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion ahead of the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also taking the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state as the favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will have any influence on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chessfriends Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1. Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection to the spa town.
District office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have teamed up under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation is pulling it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, senior citizens and advice seekers now receive information on questions such as long-term care insurance or benefits of health and care insurance companies.
For years, we have found out with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Not infrequently, many services of the cash registers are not used, because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who as business unit manager for the elderly assistance is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehab.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is seen by both managing directors, especially in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office also dedicated itself to the isolation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution to ensuring that senior citizens can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6. October
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been determined due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6. October set as a date.
The encounter of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopocal against the third division FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally scheduled.
It will be played on Tuesday, the 6. October, at 19. Clock in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will take place, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket sales that have now started.
It's special for our team to play against a third division player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by victories in the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and will qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Defending champion is third-tier relegated SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang dies at 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, has died.
He died on 5. September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20. Century in Vienna," as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has noticed badly in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
He has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not gained.
Wiese was just getting his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking space guard issue a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still in the exam," according to the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether Wiese will be displayed or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideally suited for the flourishing of the marijuana plants.
For three days, Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmunster: On Friday evening, around 23.45 clock, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmunster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to the police, and shouted to them that one might wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft petrol station.
There were also three people on the premises of the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the youngster and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nose and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and talked absusively at the thug, he initially let go of his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man has now been brought home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times past.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, one beat the face and thighs of the victim.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 metres tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 metres tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-and-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to come forward by calling 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann, Economic Promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
In many places in the countryside doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. takes over there. Frank Müller on the 1. October the practice Felstehausen.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be at his successor’s side with half a job in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller opens the practice on 12. October again, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens were Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and wants to enter the practice next year, was currently getting in touch.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When the time came, I just called her.”
The Müller couple liked the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees being his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The father of two Frank Müller also grew up there, his medical studies in Hanover were followed by wards in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering at the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From the 19. September will prepare the practice for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as GPs.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a consultation room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes velvet municipality mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the practice in Felstehausen every quarter, in the North German average practice there are about 500.
There is another general practitioner's office in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
If you attend Müller’s office hours, you can continue to look primarily at familiar faces: take over the seven medical assistants and the cleaner from the Felstehausens.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls with a smile.
She feels a little melancholy after the long time.
"But we live on in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many more times," says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6000-square-foot plot."
"So far I have always pressed myself from gardening, now it could be different".
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border checks are also ramping up on our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The checks on the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The care and safety of the people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "clear signals are needed," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia consider 'corridor' - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany and possibly also set up corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see this in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will rather intensify the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister emphasized, Slovenian does not want to lock down his borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fill his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to enter eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serb border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We can neither, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid in the morning, in the course of the day, more buses are expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which is already predicted by observers, to a slightly further west route.
Croatia: 'Extensive possibilities for border control'
Croatia's interior minister, Ostojic, had earlier stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive opportunities for border control."
It carries out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, the EU partners have since consistently given the country a good testimony in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning during a local inspection in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area, there are still still unvacated minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers in the border region had been sent.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who are accused of repeatedly gaining insight into still-unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the captured information, insider dealings in the financial markets are said to have been made.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were swindled.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are ultimately caught," the SEC statement said.
The trial of 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Assistance Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a lot of activity around Mannheim's Paradeplatz.
People run their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
You drive to the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Keep light rail.
Pulsating, bulging life with a wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the headline "Before I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is certainly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While many a passer-by spontaneously reaches for the chalk and supplements the sentence around "my life affirms", "can read", "drive through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stay short, read, say sentences such as "I am not yet so far" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions about the action itself develop on the sidelines, about life, the handling of dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action to the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the panels, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still fraught with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The dying and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by call, she immediately contacted him and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompanies those affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences that are done.
"I see life from another waiting period, consider it precious and value the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of denomination.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training courses for new employees are offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook to an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The firm also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that point last year, FedEx announced that the company would want to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the earlier forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite price increases, which average 4.9 percent and on the 4th. January take effect and despite higher surcharges for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said that it still expects earnings to increase from the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "solidly generating income when considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, that on the 31. August ended, earned FedEx $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack's expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, causing sales in its Express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating profit was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell because of higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares dropped $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on the 11th June.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-mahagoni table to decide if it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the ornate, two-storey boardroom is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The central bank has a two-fold order from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned off by the unprecedented incentive from the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most of the data from the economy shows that it is growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed's representatives anxious to reinforce that volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they're observing," Lindsey M said. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which unsettles the financial market in itself.
About half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect a wait for the Fed, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market should the Fed raise the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far from over.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or by 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was sparked by expectations that the Fed policy will uphold the phrase this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to lift the sentences at that point," he said.
In case she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the U.S.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expects an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints from Liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the Fed's representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrugged at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would curtail global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
For the Fed representatives, the market turmoil influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last couple of weeks, they would tighten the reins in that session," Stephen D said. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that appear to be not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited discernible impact on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis like the 2008 market collapse, Adam S said. Posen, former member of the Committee on the Bank of England's interest rate determination.
The recent turbulence is not coming close to this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because markets are getting upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should rush ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various takeaway options.
What's here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork natural bowells, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, including individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping trolleys and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own park grounds, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who are uninterested in supporting asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
Even with her 74 lenzen, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker shelter on Dillinger Straße.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different teaching than at a real school.
Brazil's pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to inspire women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. She does so with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar panels.
The planning for the long-awaited gym building on the Bernried sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated building proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had decided, among other things, a request for a construction "exception" or "liberation" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special shape with regard to the roof construction.
According to this, a "saddle roof with a non-centre ridge and roof overhand" is to be erected.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This gives us a wonderfully large south roof together," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which should be below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike prescribed in the development plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was necessary because the development plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roof inclination - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, the gym construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are included in costs.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports funding.
In the next process step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the district office for examination.
Peißenberg clinic moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) new Medical Director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided for by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which confirmed Landrätin Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board will make a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, 23. September.
Should the plans be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the existing Inner Station.
The rooms are there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should take up the succession, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, which declared itself ready, from 1. Take over the management of October and move to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrading" and a widening of the offer in the area of "inner medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Innere Station.
In the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to this, will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the current redevelopment at the Weilheim hospital is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairwoman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I exclude that." How the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently, a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry are housed there.
"So much better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," Fischer said of the quasi-relocation to the Lech, which had been received by the employees "positively and very understandingly".
There was no real perspective for the house, where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades, departments were closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (20.15 clock) at the Bergisches HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a cornfield near Pratau (district Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, the police announced.
After a shot-making charge, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have occurred was initially unclear.
Criminal investigations are ongoing.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A suspect has led police to the body of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youths and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, was considered a suspect, who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after failing to come home as agreed the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, investigators initially came across personal belongings of the victim.
During interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspicion against the 20-year-old finally arose.
The alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrestee admitted in the police interrogation, according to the authorities, to having killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the magistrate on Wednesday, the investigators blame him for manslaughter.
The further investigation should provide information about the closer circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need shelters: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
Pressure is growing on the housing market.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the Association Alliance "Social Housing".
By comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer required to live in an initial reception shelter as asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay.
Many then bump into the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also accounts for significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit ahead of it, which is getting bigger from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units have already been missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in shared flats.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer at the "Hotel Mama" because of the slack in the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives are to boost social housing again.
Thus, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized apartments could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The subsidy program for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be ramped up.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary, there is practically no getting through, as more and more refugees choose the way via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant its transit via Slovenia north without hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to Slovenia's interior minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set off for Croatia to get to Western Europe from there.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees the previous day.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic declared: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, it's women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on Serbia's border with the EU neighbouring country Croatia in the morning.
Most were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus as well as with taxis.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to get across the green border to Croatia on foot.
On the Croatian-Serb border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
But the border strip poses other dangers: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s.
Mine clearers should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, however, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people picked up.
Shortly before the goal closed on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated.
The convicts face prison terms of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
As of Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees were staying there.
Practically, however, no one has a chance to be granted asylum in Hungary.
According to the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in the past few weeks.
Barrier grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the onward journey to Germany.
Train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove 'stranded' across border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," according to Wernstein's mayor, Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau.
Before that, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We said right away, we'll take her by car to Passau.
"This was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the OÖN talk.
They were very grateful.
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased with that," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try it after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped, but still to try over the border.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally in high demand.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures that ensure humanity in the Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government’s attitude into the haze of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "praised country" she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to establish decent conditions for those seeking protection with us.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the initial reception centre in Traiskirchen has already been dealt with by Konrad.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organizational "mastery performance."
The Home Office, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet the number, 35,000 properties will still have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without a bottom," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the state governors.
These would have promised him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," Ferry Maier said.
The former VP mandator supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, where it will be clarified how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In times of need, it could not be that quarter givers must maintain a certain height of the towel rails or size of the skylights.
For a temporary period, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
The fact that, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, Konrad justifies with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not readily told the untruth in his face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur the costs of the Republic, as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees want to increase them to three to four.
Your own neighborhood search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For now, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and the Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, because the affected persons can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The city chief criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to do their part here.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be sealed off"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state governor Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday accorded the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Of the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing checks at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
On four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT company S&T has moved in, the remainder (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T chief executive Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the Neue Werft and later acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser expects a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is owned by one-third each from the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building is already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop will focus on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade: After all, she has now received growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and robes of various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time whether to open another shop," Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of a separate location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has widely put in the cradle by her mother.
It is most good for me when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women get enraptured at the sight of a beautiful handbag, the specialist can not answer with last security.
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's Palatinate ancestors came from a place whose residents are called show-offs.
Some also associate this trait with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upsets.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, tackles journalists rudely or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office vigorously stirs up the election campaign.
And scores well at that.
This is also registered in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is familiar to many in the winemaking village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place are over -zig corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstadt woman Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which includes the Heinz ketchup family in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not make it to the King of Hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "already a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity was "Die Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the show-offs.
The Trump success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the US.
The real estate company was founded in the first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed on the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not accept Trump because he had once run away without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared a film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken derogatoryly about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as he squeals, that's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so quick-tempered."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," the 72-year-old says.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," the 68-year-old says.
She would find it better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that is good."
If those who were in charge in the US at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My president isn't," she said.
And: "The grapes will be ripe even without the President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12 000 moviegoers, also in the US, the interest awakens.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaining village".
From the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria, there are already 20 "mountain mountaineering villages".
In the neighboring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report in the wake of the loss of leadership of the Liberals, but it has not yielded major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was aired by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed the fall of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance didn't seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise scored an average of 397,000 viewers at the five capitals, by comparison, Today 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase over ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell short of that from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafter's Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show Solo without the rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two from The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 5:30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot-Seat an average of 620,000.
The drop in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to outstrip the McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor, was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three leftover girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three turn into two, you may have mistakenly given a clue about who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women have lyrically omitted why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", her answers could become the game spoiler who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named both - beside themselves - Mackay as best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies noticed, that's when I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the home visit last week made her realise that Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unconditionally set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will air on ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scuffle as the Aussie Rugby League convert did at his first punt return Tuesday in the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-match press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne smashes at a punt restored in the first quarter of the game by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian tarmac with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company seized and his democratic efforts suppressed.
The Free voters demand the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn exam in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
Actually, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voters' Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will superimpose the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as it did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"It doesn't go on like this, we have to go to the causes," the Free Voter leader said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
That's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern is deporting, others are not."
"We have to become more capable of acting."
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing constant remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "Intermediate plus" at 47 grammar schools, in which an extension of the secondary school is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will then take another nine years until high school graduation.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of G9 must be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want that.
Free travel at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Farmer Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed with gains after a long-range directionless and nervous course of trading.

The discussion about the burdens from the nuclear phase-out has pushed the shares of RWE to a record low in the meantime and also left a deep mark on Eon.
According to Spiegel, the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend.

Investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing rocks and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The standoff was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus wanting a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be redeveloped.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-metre area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4000 square meter plot in the immediate vicinity of the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
They are waiting for corresponding offers, it is said on the part of the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
Several residents are still worried - they fear the sell-off of their leisure refuge
For months, negotiations had been held behind closed doors, pondering, debating and drawing.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group, which accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system-construction management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to counter all rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among sea stall owners who had come into the meeting evoked the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea stall owner and board member at the advocacy group of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block, which surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, like several other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "Whole bus loads have to come, so that this pays off," says Schulz
What exactly happens on the well one-hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring at Gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about offspring at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet determined, since Mother Dian keeps her close to the body so far.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling-funding campaign designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations designed to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the fundraising call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $11 million to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight-loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," Dr. said. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to take in food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries to treat type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and stomach tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI stayed with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments about the same at 29.
Among those who underwent a surgical procedure, the diabetes was completely dissolved in 36% and in 28% in part.
In the medically-treated group, in comparison, diabetes completely dissolved at only one percent and sometimes only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not decrease mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reached larger declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and were more likely to experience a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%.
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study by heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in obese people who underwent obesity surgery, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried to use more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with their BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for us to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving more attention in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unsightly in school days, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it is set in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not appropriate for the situation.
"It's impossible for anyone to be able to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terror attack of 11. September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the 11. September I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him the path to solving this problem is non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has provoked unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in intake of hand sanitizer by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, increased cases of revenue from hand sanitizer in children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show young people drinking disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There is disinfectant with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. recounted. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas Hospital, broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and if kids get at it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four splashes of hand sanitizer scented with strawberry in school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, Dr. said. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah slammed her words and was unable to leave when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and to store hand sanitizer out of the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their "mean" teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned her from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan a "chatter" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the crossbar between Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old motorist was slightly injured in a rear-end collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the roundabout industrial area and perceived too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
Property damage to the vehicles involved in the accident amounted to about 10 000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer roadworthy and had to be towed.

Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths. He insisted that he and his team-mates are not under increased control, as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader of the standings.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in the old-firm games, and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat to Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League, the defeat to 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to go on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he targeted some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious at signing new signings and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unit.
The ex-boss of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic in the conversation during the transfer period, has indicated he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.

Neilson sticks with what he said, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on any performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was rebuked after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn area outside an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's certain to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."

McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup matches or leagues, which have not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the period May to July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, the figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of workers now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The secretary of state for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: "The government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunks disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officers take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test in a 16-year-old showed 0.89 per thousand.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per thousand and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionlessly.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he wants, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I did.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for it.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded after wet police chase to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang out of police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few feet away from a police officer who tried to "softly persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a housebreaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water- and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria's stewards tried to install a spy in its stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what is best for racing and that he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris, which he can't explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I was planning not to say anything about it, and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I'll name when asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly take their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, formerly. Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that bring me to the view that it will be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and get out of my mind, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I've now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'm going to put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his license across the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, which was the case.
But it also had it that way on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver escape
Police have arrested a man over the weekend after a clash with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was admitted by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver escape and failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals over claims to wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackling as an "agenda setting" by two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled comment on the Storm team after his squad scored the finals win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "sample example" of the Rugby League, saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle and said they were focused only on their "contact" at the tackle.
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading coaches on his squad made him confident as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques. But over the past six weeks, we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has yielded the turnaround for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great squad to train. He's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is strange how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's going to take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points are something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means we will still meet them at one stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-finals at AAMI Park. Ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants in the marina over the course of the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire crowd and that in the cafe might have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a bail of 200,000 dollars as collateral to reach his release.
"After reading the two people's affidavits, it is clear that the requirement of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic has been released on bail, on conditions that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and adhere to a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Cab tears apart
In a rear-end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to swerve to the left at the last moment, the police said.
The driver's cab of the accident causer tore apart completely.
The driver was taken to a hospital seriously injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.m.
There was a loss of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports and immediately alerted her mother.
Police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "related" web research that used terms for the search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he did it, as it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare her."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction, - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when drinking, and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant was using computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself guilty in the sense of the indictment, indecent images of children on 14. To have recorded June last year, on the 25th Having violated the conditions in January this year and not in court for a hearing on 24. March of this year to have appeared.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was to be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the register of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers dodge small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the large checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers increasingly let people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side out, a spokesman for the federal police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration.
At Munich Central Station, according to Federal Police data, significantly more refugees arrived on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8.00 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of checks on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The powerful low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour are still to be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the car manufacturers at the IAA show their innovations.
In 2015, there was movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27. September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest firsts for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available at the dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is promising an entry point below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
As a second variant, the station wagon will follow in the spring, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And what else is being driven up on new compact cars in addition to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and an emphasised sporty GT version.
He will go on sale early next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
But the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New to the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbocharged engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque according to the manufacturer is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The Baleno in Europe will start sales in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot put on their hands on the front section: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time Apple's CarPlay was integrated.
In addition, the IAA in the compact class is joined by a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex-detainee of the prison Tegel, who was housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were only locked up in the too confined spaces for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-detainee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: He was housed in the prison Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now back on the loose, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit for the undignified conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges overturned the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appeal and dismissed the case there for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Court of Appeal now decides on amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention were decisive for the compensation for the period in question, a compensation claim was given, it said.
Otherwise, "a withering of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the monetary compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only awarded damages to a prisoner in April because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The then plaintiff was housed daily for three months between 15 to 21 hours in a cell of the same time as in the Karlsruhe case.
Berlin's prisons had also hit the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even brawls are said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 positions in Tegel are not filled due to a lack of young talent, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's up for Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it".
What is coming to Germany, the following overview provides.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is being built (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but above all for affordable rental properties: every year, 60000 to 8000 social housing falls out of the rental price commitment, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from the current 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80 000 social housing units would have to be built annually and the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: from the ban on working for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on the work of asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority of people have prevailed that refugees should be given access to the labour market more quickly, also because of the shortage of skilled workers.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and job-related language courses.
Research also shows that workplaces are most often mediated through personal contacts.
The establishment of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the royal road to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that few refugee parents give their children to daycare, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the day-care center, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the demand for educators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without German language skills are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The Deutsches Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients to study - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his stance.
Refugees willing to study could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act when they start their studies.
The latter generally do not receive a Bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the obligation of the goods.
Patient refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from 1. January 2016 on, this range is shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsches Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association, which takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
The rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options.
This includes a willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to resolve such conflicts in Germany "immediately forfeit their right to stay here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration will be much more of an issue for society in the future than it is today.
This will also require the majority society to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany for, must become a reality in the next few years, if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man power and capacity, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money must flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for all arrivals to be handed out health cards at the time of registration.
Services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed off so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act provides for.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly have to create the language barriers.
Already, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be covered, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and the adolescents are concerned with HIV education.
With the partly other clinical pictures, however, German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even be in sight to be relieved.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, several refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who have post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, racing heart and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe scare and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social welfare offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social welfare offices, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the Ziegelwasen.
“Our passion is the circus.”
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and junior chef.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current manegen production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm is in the family’s blood.
"It is important to us to get people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Manegen cocktail with cosmopolitan city flair" is what director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo want to record loosely.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to take women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salvos, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with sensitivity and joint.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little other and fascinates with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Maladministration in the keeping of circus animals is all too often an issue at various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every caress.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from the eyes if possible every wish.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel comfortable, it does not want to go into the manege.
The top priority: to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland stalmn and a zebra mare.
The two animals have lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte tells Probst.
The Zebroid is not ready for the manege yet, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20. September daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to his performances.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread quickly over social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with booing.
Last month, they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesperson told Innocent Gonese that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones that warned them against, Mr. Mugabe's speech to disturb.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title of 'Death,'" he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
She warns the Members-of-Latviaty concerned that immunity in parliament will end, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who is to lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ Annual revenue and "will be focused on providing previously unmatched, integrated technology solutions to businesses," according to a statement from the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage has called it "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the move away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that tightly focused companies deliver better performance.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his involvement in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain next summer.
The big shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but like Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
An unpleasant pattern is also developing.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wilshere's illnesses since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to record the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rate will continue during last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a prone period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger faces a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are allowed to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal have learned the lesson from last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to his first European Cup triumph with his management.
"That drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about men's friendships
The absence of similar depictions in shows is evident, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more likely to remain in men than women.
In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the centerpiece of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social-media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much more profound effect on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments while watching football in cozy armchairs and Ross's longing for Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back to fully exploring their feelings.
As one telephone pastoral care employee explained it to me: "my listener role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal, has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I'll cope with it" has an enormous impact, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria scores on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, helping PSG move past Malmö.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept their course when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with a hugely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French champions, but afterward they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead, as Cavani in the 61. Minute a header goal scored.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they not only seek qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game from Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal. He was later substituted in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, to cause problems for our opponents and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score another one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which could hold a 2:2 draw on its own pitch against Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend, but he was stabbed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was described as the man who can take PSG to the next tier in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmö defence before finishing past Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed PSG would score a big win, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that stage, competed at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two lined up deep in midfield.
But except for a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who goes far from Kevin Trapp's post in the 34. Minute went by, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG themselves sometimes gave up, with some mispasses and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patted in no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then abandoned after Cavani deployed him after the restart.
Even so, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shot, which was taken by Wiland in the 52nd. Minute was steered past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic fished up a left flank from Maxwell.
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league that doesn't have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5bn on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn pushes down demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange a rapid rise in trading early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion in debt.
The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
It gave up 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will retorn President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US president and first lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its increasing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to Bayern Munich
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
FC Bayern were obviously on the verge of signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish champions, three cup winners, four Champions League winners, two clubs world champions, two times European champions, once world champions - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 European Championships before the farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't win anything," he recounts.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't switch
The change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the squad without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf, knocking out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrating the king-class triumph in the end.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in terms of a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it in the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted in shock, with insulted disbelief and shouted " Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the actor's comments from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to urge people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People championed finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her directing "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain diversity to her - that's SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was released.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement has had a nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a nod to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, even albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck on whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are invited to visit the pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and service assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show that just her 7. Season concluded, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-won victory, still in shock over winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live on," Isaac E said! about his pile of money.
So suddenly .. as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, even though he was the first ever to finish the course, isn't receiving any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it's given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, he receives the great gratification.
I don't think he's harboring any grudges about that.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for one Eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within one half of the Houston Astros' second American League wildcard place.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullp, and so I want to get into the game very focused.
The Tiger-designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-pointer hit game since he scored four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6. July had.
"He swung the batting wood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (beat training), looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the backside at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the closing run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th in the Major League. Sometimes this season, Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer managed an RBI double against the Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon, scoring the stand of 5-4.
The right-hander, however, outspoked Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a yet-to-be-moving Phil Hughes at the start of the match.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been knocked out of the injured list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back pain.
"Obviously not the beginning I wished for," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes dropped a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who managed a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 winning streak with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out of the game as he tried to get to the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers gained in the second, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't do particularly well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, not scoring points in the third inning before being replaced by the Relever right-hander A.J.Achter.
At Hughes, it came to three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez retired because of an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He's from Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007, is investigating.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is due to be activated for Wednesday's launch.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is dropped from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he has been in exchange with LHP David Price on 30. July was acquired
He's had since 20. August missing due to a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there.
They are then to be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government headquarters responsible for the initial reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe the decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European states of "collective looking away."
Four years ago, it was glad that the chalice of a military participation passed Germany by.
"Now the conflict lands crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced checks on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV channel ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary now.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's what's agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
EU interior ministers want to go next Tuesday (22. September) at a special meeting, take a new approach to the binding distribution of a further 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong number of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to support the Länder more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the prime ministers in the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized that those people who need protection would get it too.
But those who do not have a prospect to stay cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal off the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent traffickers from seeking alternative routes via Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were initial arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Spacecraft "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean is sloshing.
This is concluded by researchers from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon tumbles slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too big for a consistently solid celestial body, according to a statement from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon in 2006, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Leuven, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced break."
"This hits us hard, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sporting director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper, referring to the possible commitment of a club-less professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills."
Goal-scorer Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
The Austrian international is scheduled to enter running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he was left without a serious loss.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to your slim line, you are often advised against it.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, the immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the US.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said Tuesday.
Drivers in particular are being sought.
Already last year, UPS had increased its workforce by 95000 temporary workers for the holiday season.
In the face of booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements earlier since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
Next night, the hair dryer will break through in the valleys of the north side of the Alps, as Meteoswiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the Föhn valleys.
After the end of the blow-dry on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, which brings heavy rainfall, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the Föhn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The Föhn can sometimes penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the southern slope of the Alps begins to jam.
This is where rain sets in, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, in the next 48 hours, south of the Alps, more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer runs out of air, as a result of a cold front with strong, partly thundery rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, however, it will be sunnier and warmer with up to 25 degrees on weekends.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was christened the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as a "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes could often live their faith in secret for centuries as a minority.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He perceived the city at the time as a depraved scapegoat.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite bleak.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Father.
He spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one sentence each of the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
That's a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhut Order.
"That's when the education happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
“I tried to work this out to perhaps get along with the Father again.”
His second concern is to help art regain importance in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds is now marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this regard, I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the pictures, to let them work on themselves, to discover and to feel what power they have: "The picture is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had always been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings".
Alt did not take care to fully grasp the Bible, but to select the important, also mysterious topics for him.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will take place on 15. November will open at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction begins for BMX railway approaching
Plans made, found space, companies commissioned, earth mounds modeled for a circuit: A year later, almost everything was ready - but even before the official opening of the BMX track, this was already over.
Omissions in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among local residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for a building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now communicate in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something more visible is happening this year," she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without "further remembrance break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and is assuring politicians their help in addressing the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be our country's biggest challenge since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say, I'm not concerned, I have nothing to do with it."
"Every single person must be interested in getting to grips with this issue," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23. September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday in the Chancellery and I meet the Minister of State Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"That's where the issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive course must be set by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are making a clear sign if they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's head of sports Rudi Völler told the Bild newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "a matter of course."
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one is allowed to look away."
"We football Bundesliga players can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
For the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great joint effort of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome," which we spent, is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the entire sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO loses eye in accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell after midnight on a water glass, which he had carried in the left hand, report the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us so last week," the "WiWo" quotes SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner as saying.
McDermott can do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
“I’m fully there for SAP, full in my job.”
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Something like this can happen to everyone."
"It's important to get back up when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore no more eligible for the night race in Singapore at the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been smashed.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 / Sky).
"We can't resort to him unfortunately," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high burden on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his regular team at the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He will most likely play the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final move for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl thinks is understandable: "Marco is not so wrong with that."
"I think we have a good chance of picking up the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the will of the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA car fair of a "new mobility age."
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and cause less traffic jams, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
In order to "not impose any additional liability risks" on the driver, the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to campaign for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for the people as drivers.
When driving automatically, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "only to be expected well after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany at around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars as skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail in the next decade, 32 percent do not expect it until 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the US.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control throughout the entire ride on all roads.
On the highway, this could be imagined in flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in traffic jams 45 percent.
Well one in four would leave control to the car under no circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis European Championships
The Düsseldorfer wants according to the current status in the title fights of the 25. September to 4. October only in singles.
The final decision is due to be taken no later than 22. September fall.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said German coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, that's a disadvantage, we're not such a clear favourite now," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who tops the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we became European champions."
"We should be guided by that," the world number five declared.
English international footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno in a tackle and replaced after a long period of treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in the 20-year-old teammate of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure horror cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with him putting men in skirts.
"I can't say anymore today that I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, by now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", the one from 18. September on in the art hall of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung can be seen, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejecting attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful dresses," said the director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely to be overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellently choreographed work of art, for which a lot of effort was put into: In order to style the dolls, for example, a stylist was specially engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the creators have carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a Lederhosen outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, tentative fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought it.
For his first fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen used to be about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion leader Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a bigger role, then was displaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style periods, is an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery industry association.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken away.
Private specialty stores and also the wholesaler almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The mass-produced goods are nowadays produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are almost exclusively distributed by chains.
In addition, the export, currently to Russia and the USA, weakens.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been carrying out a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I could not do anything with traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memento.
In doing so, I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney to launch new 'Mary Poppins' movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still ventures to a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, it is not about a remake, but a kind of sequel that is set 20 years after the first film with the magic nanny.
It's about the Nanny's experiences with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.

Xi is pushing to open the economy more broadly to the world
The economy needs to open up broader outwards to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business start-ups," he said in an address at the 16th. Meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and pushing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are out of the question for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen checks on the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of a supply to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of debt-financed companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU to double mercury limit in predator fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predator fish and thus expect consumers to have a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and young children," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish are to be raised for "economic policy reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the limit values still in force.
After the doubling of the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller peace fish, such as carp, are usually so low-stressed that they already meet the planned highs today.
The lowering of small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction that alone helps the economy," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is greatly enriched via the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies."
However, the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values, however, that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to written information from the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal-fired power plants eject the Greens’ member of the Bundestag, Annalena Baerbock, more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and nationwide exceeded," the "Spiegel" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
