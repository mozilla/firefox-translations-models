This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal&#39;s plumage was maroon on top and light or carotenoid colored on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but do have other features of feathers -- barbs and barbules -- the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers surmised that although the sample was a young dinosaur&#39;s tail, it showed adult plumage rather than chick down.
The researchers claimed that although this is a young dinosaur&#39;s tail, the specimen shows adult plumage and no chick down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Turkey&#39;s Gaziantep early yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty others.
According to the governor&#39;s office, nineteen of the injured are law enforcement officers.
Police said they suspect a Daesh (ISIL) militant supporter to be behind the attack.
They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine a star&#39;s Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow, luminosity and rotation are considered together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls in on the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also pulls on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was diagnosed by Dr. Tony Moll discovered in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
&quot;In an interview, he said the new variant was &quot;extremely worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.&quot;&quot;
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Despite this, the proportion of XDR-TB in the overall cohort of people with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

&quot;&quot;&quot;They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.&quot;
&quot;Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which are often fairly constant in temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground,&quot; said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.&quot;
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and slip a pre-printed sheet of paper listing the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter&#39;s identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
French electoral law sets the procedure fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the start of the election and that no envelopes are dropped except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness any part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Uka&#39;s gun jammed when he aimed for the head of a fifth man. Since then, Schneider has been suffering from chronic pain, is blind in one eye and is missing part of his skull. His face had to be reconstructed using titanium.
Schneider testified over a video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
Beyond Wednesday&#39;s event, Carpanedo took part in the championship in two individual races.
Her first was the slalom, where she received a &quot;did not finish&quot; in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women&#39;s group with a combined time of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who took ninth place.
Four skiers in crutch skiing did not finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in giant slalom failed to place in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: &quot;We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her mobile phone and laptop.&quot;
The defendants&#39; names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was consequently transferred to Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, meanwhile, has been charged with the murder of her son in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held in custody awaiting trial and charges, but eyewitness testimony may have been falsified as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: &quot;Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects.&quot;
The Crown Office, which is spearheading the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further, at least pending the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians are demanding that the borders be reset to how they were before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics said to be covered include the future of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority will only accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying plague containment effort were to be closely supervised by rangers as the effort was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
A partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited qualified volunteers through the Sporting Shooters Association&#39;s hunt program.
According to Mick O&#39;Flynn, executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four gunners selected for the first hunt operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly yesterday sworn in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
It is Martelly&#39;s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly&#39;s response to widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported. A total of six fires were started and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
&quot;Last week, the METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company classified as &#39;non-serious&#39;.&quot;
The ministry responded by calling Apple&#39;s postponement of the report &quot;really regrettable.&quot;
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Civil Protection Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady as she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and started working at the National Women&#39;s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the development of the fetus&#39; lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two &quot;black box&quot; flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
&quot;Tommy Dreamer said: &quot;&quot;Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.&quot;&quot;&quot;
Dustin &quot;Goldust&quot; Runnels commented, &quot;Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even crazier... love her and will miss her... hopefully she&#39;s in a better place.&quot;
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the proportion opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three medley relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his many ailments have put his fitness in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth&#39;s water supply, along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, especially Earth, are formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors &quot;political gossip and silliness.&quot;
It is speculated that he could run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than the older ground-penetrating radar-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be established and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley. There is no on-site parking or park and ride facilities.
With concerns about lack of transportation, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team&#39;s supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador&#39;s Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process had previously been thought to be due to mating between a native Darwin&#39;s finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, took much longer.
Gold can be processed into many different forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures called illuminated manuscripts in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then shape into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system in almost every home.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses frequented by mixed company of men and women.
If you&#39;re calling someone thousands of miles away, use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth&#39;s atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and vision.
It takes a gigantic rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service the wheel has done us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the railroad, the automobile, and many other modes of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that will eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and just as deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger&#39;s roar does not sound like the full-bodied lion&#39;s roar, but more like a set of snarling roared words.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and track animals for food (prey). They sniff at where they were on the ground.
You can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they resettle on a new island so that they cannot easily able to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adjust to its new environment, and then it begins to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We mainly eat plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaur.
Its long jaws were fitted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don&#39;t know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that got into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. rex was no match for it.
While we may be familiar with most of their diet, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs. The rich men, on the other hand, preferred to hold banquets together, lying on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses weren&#39;t that important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops consisted simply of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. Traveling further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there by that time.
Although all countries were &quot;Scandinavian&quot;, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you&#39;ve seen the film &quot;Legacy of the Knights Templar,&quot; you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words &quot;Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.&quot; The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾&quot; x 24½&quot;) was rolled up for safekeeping early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing fighting liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
&quot;It was ruled by the &#39;Vichy&#39; French. These were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors rather than fight them.&quot;
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called &quot;Operation Dragoon&quot;.
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge through multiple generations, a sustained cultural footprint, and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and in the absence of a national executive branch or national judiciary, it relied on state agencies to enforce all of its laws, often without cooperation.
He also had no power to overrule interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and states took central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world together with the German national football team and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
&quot;Because of the cluster/group of islands, Japan has been, is geographically commonly referred to as the &#39;Archipelago&#39;.&quot;
Taiwan&#39;s beginnings date back to the 15th century when European navigators passed by and recorded the island&#39;s name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in indigenous grain farming methods and employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan&#39;s western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which is the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly, its image format was inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35mm format is confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore known as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratios.
The much-maligned and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a level of order in an image.
It states that the crossing point of the lines dividing an image vertically and horizontally into thirds is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the major Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire stretches of sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different ages. Each period of time in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
There were also volatile periods of divided provinces between the individual dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times bitter wars raged among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the Xi&#39;an Grand Palace.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same goes for the military, as instead of class, army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave that became known as &quot;Hira&quot; on the mountain of &quot;Nur&quot; (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has stood the test of time and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad&#39;s spiritual leanings.
Located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it&#39;s not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
One sees nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that is still standing today.
In the third century B.C. Built by the Egyptians around 1000 BC, the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to worship deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or &quot;Giza Necropolis&quot; in Egypt&#39;s Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops&#39; wives and family members.
The &quot;up&quot; symbol looks like a V and the &quot;down&quot; symbol looks like a bracket or square with the bottom bar missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means you start at the frog (this is where your hand is holding the bow) and draw the bow.
Bowing up typically produces a softer sound, while bowing down is stronger and more expressive.
Feel free to add your own pencil marks; remember, however, that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King&#39;s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were killed on October 6, 1789 forced to return to Paris at Versailles by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people uttering threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the outraged crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of its expenses, and interest on loans flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people represented the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which agreed to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push, or the technological imperative, to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic, entwined with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has “impacts” on societies that are inherent rather than socially determined.
It can be said, for example, that the automobile inevitably brings with it the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread automobile ownership also leads to an increased number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to this geography arose and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around AD 400 and lasted until about AD 1100.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, largely due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices deemed more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
At this time, the title of fashion capital of the world also migrated from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries. and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Needs economy is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, farming practice that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion and combines them with rotating tillage or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ from others in terms of the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the unfortunate few cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse during childhood.
&quot;Such children are called &#39;feral&#39;&quot; or wild. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the child&#39;s neglect was due to the parents&#39; inability to cope with severe intellectual or physical limitations to accept the child.&quot;
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely consistent with those of its specific foster animal, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual help is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to master alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, but many are forced to.
For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster home is designed to meet any needs that they were not provided in the home they were previously taken out of.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, &#39;learning&#39; and &#39;socialization&#39; are put forward as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
&#39;Personal engagement&#39; and &#39;lasting relationships&#39; were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President&#39;s Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand speech because of brain damage can still appreciate the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Also, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth suppression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it shouldn&#39;t surprise us if our own ancestors solved their &quot;protein problem&quot; in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you&#39;re someone who sets the alarm before you sleep, you can put it across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known for their diuretic properties) before bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calm that a person possesses is inversely related to the level of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Yoga of the gods is at the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war ended, the clash of systems, trajectory and culture led to countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would in reality be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had collapsed and the only hope was to withdraw and reposition along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after fighting in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties invaded the eastern regions of Poland.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time impeding the enemy&#39;s ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to get manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain along with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated as early as about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals so that they could easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing land. The goats were looked after by goatherds, much like the more well-known shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
Conveyor tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the conveyor tracks were just parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, people realized that rails with an iron band are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning &quot;Upright Man&quot;).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Biped species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
We can live greener, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some future suffering.
This is in many cases just like symptomatic treatment. However, if you don&#39;t just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really evident that the world has changed a lot due to mankind&#39;s scientific and technological advances and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and people&#39;s extravagant lifestyles.
After its passage through Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap&#39;s printers a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, known today as &quot;Dunlap broadsides&quot;.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that survive are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many don&#39;t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of ingestion poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term &quot;bug&quot; is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the age old familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicol, ie adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over as parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not all about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and making observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle&#39;s views on all questions of science, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often due in significant part to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not merely reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perform free-running cycles for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they either labeled the phage&#39;s DNA with radioactive phosphorus or labeled a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose work is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transportation system based on the private car.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its steady states that has sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
Rarely in developed countries will you hear as many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers just plain incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; traffic flows therefore have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them dodge enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small dens in which to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was central to the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable since it doesn&#39;t seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on earth. It carries more than eight times as much as water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet&#39;s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in the technical sophistication of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then a good thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most working in the state, while Latin is commonly used at religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since ancient times as they can all be found in nature in their pristine form and mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more closely to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don&#39;t forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe consists entirely of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit in the full stop at the end of this sentence.
As a result, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has receded into the background, relegating it in status and use.
People today write messages on computer screens without ever going near a pencil sharpener.
It will be interesting to see what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like rolling a heavy truck up a hill. When the nucleus is split again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they will break up with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands.
There could be more maria on the near side as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want the very things they do and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg&#39;s two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is trying to stay &quot;one of the boys&quot; (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and make everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones that local management may not accommodate.
The presence of a true &quot;invisible team&quot; (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
&quot;The &quot;&quot;invisible team&quot;&quot; is the leadership team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x&quot;
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can thrive when all available resources across all functional departments of an organization are used effectively.
As a result, an organization&#39;s collaborative effort to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of addressing customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it a lot more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what is going on in our heads.
While strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include governance, setting strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become disciplines in their own right, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is out of the question.
Virtual field trips are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students&#39; writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling early in their blogging experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging &quot;also forces students to learn more about the world around them.&quot; The need to engage audiences inspires students to write smartly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning well outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others&#39; texts and present their own perspectives on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada&#39;s charming, bilingual capital and features a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada&#39;s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more characterize Ontario as what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canada has citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known for being luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (just not one that looks expensive.
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be consistent when turning men away, and don&#39;t be afraid to defend your point (cultural differences or not, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s okay!)
Today&#39;s Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to have it abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it&#39;s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of tinnef, but this is all for the tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city&#39;s streets, especially the city center.
Whilst Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn the status of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made &quot;Timbuktu&quot; a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu has a reputation as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the key stops on Louis Gates&#39; PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country&#39;s cities because it has more of an Arabic than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa&#39;s main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It can also be worth purchasing a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is the eponym for the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, head off the island and head to the opposite shore from Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island&#39;s urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonists made their own. If you&#39;re looking for traces of the area&#39;s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world&#39;s largest mangrove belt, stretching 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian national territory is referred to as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren&#39;t just mangrove swamps though - they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², a third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, with most buses, particularly eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are serviced by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.x
Shared taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l&#39;Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly known as the Greater Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the clash of Spanish conquistadors with local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at Las Cañitas polo fields in December.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.x
For information on competitions and where to buy polo match tickets, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is determined in line with the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although UK and US currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange currency in the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity mean it feels colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that visitors stay at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, elk, bear, and virtually any large animal may appear, they can still attack you.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they don&#39;t keep enough distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife. So avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep your storage clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750&#39;s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an inglorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
With Auckland spanning two ports, beaches are plentiful. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive&#39;s beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a lovely shopping promenade along the shore. Swimming is safe here.
The main local beer is “Number One”. It&#39;s not a complex beer, but it&#39;s pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be more compatible.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you&#39;re worried.
&quot;For Australians, the idea of &#39;flat white&#39; coffee is alien. A small black is &#39;espresso&#39;, cappuccino is topped up high with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.&quot;
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are year-round and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
However, you should heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They may occasionally occur outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.x
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on-site, and most visitors find this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you need to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that parts of the festival still have music playing late into the night, even after the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you&#39;re crossing the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check the cabin&#39;s location, as breaking through ice makes some pretty awful noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises also include time to stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos tend to go to great lengths to keep guests and spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special menu of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests happy and making them stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, being drunk impairs judgement, and all good players understand the importance of staying sober.
If you want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, grip is poor and you cannot ride as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be affected by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.x
On the downside, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to describe a land journey to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can spot them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called &quot;bush walk&quot;, &quot;walking safari&quot; or &quot;footing&quot;) consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled, due to the coronavirus.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards even if you are not in the room.
If an iron isn&#39;t available or you don&#39;t want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of these are proving to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely and if you are concerned then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar with their home regions.
Bugs can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are not usually classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods that are exempt from duty and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is arguably the most challenging driving challenge, as it often crosses remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you&#39;re not used to driving on country roads, be wary: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp bends predominate here.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, e.g. B. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, just like in the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit scones are common, with apples being cooked into scones year-round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, then try what are known as donuts, pancakes, or donuts, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply flavored dishes. The Javanese prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a number of aromatic spices as flavor carriers.
Stirrups are aids for the rider&#39;s feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider&#39;s feet could potentially get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and catches his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse bolts. A number of safety precautions can be taken to keep this risk as low as possible.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Also, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile&#39;s premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one attaches skis or a snowboard to one&#39;s feet and descends a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as &quot;ski bums,&quot; planning their entire vacation around skiing in one specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC. BC back!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski touring.
It is similar to alpine touring or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter is done over steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Consider the ski route like a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions you are able to cover slightly greater distances than when hiking - only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has numerous independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through multiple countries.
However, the Schengen area works a bit like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what crafted items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variances, where the age limit in areas like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be called &quot;antique&quot; even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also relevant to many working in other occupations.
Even in the past, not all Sámi herded reindeer on a large scale, but made a living from fishing, hunting and the like. They kept reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
&quot;Even though the term &#39;Gypsy&#39; is mostly used by non-Roma, it is often taken as offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.&quot;
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are about to visit, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than yours. However, their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are urged to be vigilant for any type of severe weather affecting their area as it may impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should take professional training to do so.
&quot;An internet search for &#39;Hostile Environments Course&#39; will likely return the address of a local company.&quot;
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with hands-on experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for the return journey.
Governments&#39; willingness to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people prior to their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning stream of waves that have broken on the beach, often at reefs or the like.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur from overexertion trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you come out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won&#39;t get caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you&#39;ve been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adjust to the new culture may find it particularly difficult to readjust to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a period abroad, you have adapted to another culture and shed some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
One might not expect patience and understanding towards returning travelers as well.
The Sound and Light Show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while there is silence before the show starts.
Usually you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The story of sounds and lights is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are presented on the pyramids, illuminating the different pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. Sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the submerged caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula&#39;s mountains meet the plateau here and then rise again to form the 220-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, the highest peak of which is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cellular phone, as one must be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is widely used by vessels, including pleasure craft, and expeditions that require long-distance data and voice connectivity.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
Studying and taking courses abroad is an increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off.
This is particularly popular with school graduates as it allows them to take a year off before college without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a bridging year abroad program can actually improve your chances of gaining higher education in your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great boat tour destination. The &quot;land of a thousand lakes&quot; also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don&#39;t necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and major lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or eight owning a boat.
While this is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty.)
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days, returning in the evening and staying overnight on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of the shipboard excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have been through a traumatic experience.
You don&#39;t have to be ashamed of that: It&#39;s nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some overcome fears associated with the unknown or feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often a very important factor when it comes to corporate documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but difficulties have arisen on other routes and with smaller companies.
When shipping things via air freight, unloading and clearing customs could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don&#39;t allow shipping luggage without a passenger, and that&#39;s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty chunk of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to foot the bill).
That&#39;s not cheap though: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of fliers who are willing to pay big bucks and charge accordingly for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is Turkey&#39;s third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and bustling business center situated on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings and modern shopping malls are characterized by classic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It is worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in brilliant colours.
The 403 Scotturb bus runs regularly to Sintra via Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (Sanctuary) - a place world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site as well as a place of almost immeasurable importance to a significant portion of the world&#39;s population.
There are still alive many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with families who were murdered or worked themselves to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Don&#39;t joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not mar the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan as it is set by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements on the metro are in Catalan only, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate cliché, the best way to navigate Paris is to put on your best self and behave like someone who is &quot;bien élevé&quot; (well mannered). This will make things a lot easier to deal with.
Parisians&#39; gruff exterior quickly disappears when you adopt basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats and capercaillie, as well as many more common species in general.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that reach above the knees and also cover their shoulders.
While most monasteries have wrap-around skirts for women who come unprepared, if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach above the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is one size fits all for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever ingredient is available like cheese, tuna, etc.
&quot;All nouns next to the word Sie for &quot;&quot;you&quot;&quot; always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.&quot;
This is an important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It also arguably makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because of the need to determine if an adjective or adjective is being used as a noun.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
&quot;Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means &#39;dear&#39;, whereas carro means &#39;chariot&#39;.&quot;
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Of course, if you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn&#39;t need to be learned.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution during their heyday was not the problem it is today, they are typically located in cities or on campuses that are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility associated with the imperial court.
&quot;Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even &#39;just one&#39; specimen.&quot;
Visiting a formally landscaped garden and collecting &quot;samples&quot; will also throw you out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to navigate and buy almost anything once you arrive.
Being in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, expect both heat (always) and strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you choose to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter Vigil awake in some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, with congregational celebrations often beginning at midnight celebrating Christ&#39;s resurrection.
All of the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or washing up.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazer in the Galapagos Islands.
Many mammals have been introduced since humans first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights as the sky is dark more or less 24 hours a day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what westerners might be used to.
Suits are standard business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is vital, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual accomplishments.
Employees are often required to seek the approval of their manager for any decision they make, and are expected to follow their manager&#39;s instructions unconditionally.
