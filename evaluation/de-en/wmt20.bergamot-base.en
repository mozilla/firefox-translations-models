Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the Prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out during the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with around 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety regulations.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanethiol escaped from a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area widely smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an operational accident.
Woman quits her job to search for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job for it. Seven-year-old Border Collie had run away from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days of the bitch missing every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but to no avail.
Thunder had sent dog into panic
Hoping that Katie might still be staying at the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the front desk. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
Using flyers and views in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. “I never gave up. I've never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a phone call: A man came forward and said that Katie was in his court. But when King got there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. “I was just hugging her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake." “The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found it.”
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. There are also three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition is talking about a "frightening" extent.
In the case of the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and nearly 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is according to a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have resurfaced so far. The still missing weapons and weapon parts are, among other things, six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 weapon barrels for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "frightening," said the left-wing member of parliament Martina Renner. This was all the more true because hardly anything had been found again in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor record." Renner criticized that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigation against the Bundeswehr officer Franco A., who was suspected of terrorism. "And that's even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing that ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters at first. The shipping company said that an official decision from Tehran was awaited.
The "Stena Impero" was on the 19th. July was raised by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the sea road of Hormuz on the charge of violating safety regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of global oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to people's courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has honoured the commitment of the people of the GDR who took to the streets in the Peaceful Revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU group on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The state security was taken away from the horror," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold record. Despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he intends to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit figures will have to be generated in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. This was found out by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments in rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so violently against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a low-lying layer in the cerebrum, which triggers the laughter even when tickling is expected.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out during the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area of the cerebral cortex in question are suppressed during self-touch. This is also the case when living things clean themselves. During the external touch and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh about were increased.
But if the self-touch and touch by others happen at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-touch and contact by others. The new findings suggested that people can't tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In the process, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed flight behavior or frightening rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and people.
Disaster averted: Major fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy to the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out in the night to Thursday.
According to authorities, no substances that are hazardous to health should have leaked. The samples taken give no reason to worry, Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticised by own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in parliament after repealing the forced break on Wednesday night. The Premier threatens to put the country on 31. Leading October without a deal from the EU shouldn't let Brussels take in on its demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he intends to achieve this, however, is unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and that country again to one would be to complete the EU exit." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum election campaign in 2016.
Memorial to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They are reminiscent of the roses that had laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to attend the opening.
Right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had on 22. In July 2011, a car bomb was detonated in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dead dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution in the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said shipping company chief Erik Hånell. Around noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Office in London described the arrest of the vessel as illegal. “This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the tanker on the 19th. July, on charges of disregarding rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They would have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected behind the arrest of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: In early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, had been put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war-torn country of Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conjectures that it was a barter transaction to get the "Stena Impero" free, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The U.S. had single-handedly withdrawn from the international nuclear deal in 2018, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been putting pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended to other areas. Iran has so far resisted the pressure.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for a military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protecting powers, wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be predestined to become a "war winner." In the face of the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reshire. Financial chiefs of Asian firms considering moving their production from China to another country, India cite in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. This, of course, has to do not only with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be set to play a more significant role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump’s focus. Derogatingly titled "Kingdom of Tariffs" in the White House, America stripped the emerging country of the trade concessions for 2000 products in early June. The U.S. has prohibitively accused India of high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India are of course only a sideshow. In addition, America also considers the world’s largest democracy through security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington are linking concern over China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in on safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now getting building permits for buildings faster. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more tangible insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic optics, a lot has turned out for the better in India in the first five years of mode. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by the fact that internationally less competitive companies are protected from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even established new barriers.
In the West, Modi attaches the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well which vocabulary of Western managers pleases. At its core, however, the "India First" advocate never backed away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who survive thanks to the foreclosure of their industries are among the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted politics.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. A public funeral service was scheduled for Sunday in Paris's Invalid Cathedral, according to media reports.
The competitor is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world's top was already in the finish, when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium. In the men's first run-up over 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He could barely hold on his feet a good 300 metres before the finish, ran in unhealthy stance when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly underwent him and dragged him to the finish line while supporting the last half of the stadium. However, the forces were still sufficient for both to stop the running wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene hadn't been strange enough.
“I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly caught the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy, he first dodged, did not want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this was going to be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the world governing body. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't have even started. "That's why I'm proud to be running here for my country," he said.
He did that forcefully that evening - and much more intensely than he would have imagined. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this run-up. In the end, it had used nothing, because the Busby, which came to the finish only with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Association at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was nevertheless disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I’ve been under 18 minutes before.” However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million-dollar mash: Egyptians gear up for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. An increased police presence was observed in central Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already stepped up their road checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for messages and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Al-Sisi's opponents
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million-dollar march" in central squares in the country for today Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution." The man is not a good one for most young Egyptians, because he was a subcontractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be independently confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and did not comment on the figures.
Arbitrary Arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW said, citing lawyers. The allegations against those arrested range from "spreading misinformation" to membership in a "terrorist association," according to their lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothes, interviewed and searched arbitrarily passers-by, according to HRW data.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. The government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be freed from the sales tax on donations in kind, said the Ministry on a question of the Greens parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay little or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens send back every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - subsequently ended up in the garbage. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind such as a turnover, on which then sales tax is incurred.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donating. This applies not only to online retail, but also to other shops from the fashion store to the hardware store.
Banksy art at auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
Street art star Banksy's well-known work, "Devolved Parliament," is due to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude characterized by animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is on 3. October is to be auctioned. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited at Bristol's Museum in southwest Britain in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29. March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called Question Time, was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change hands for a million amount.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered on Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons after lifting a forced break imposed by the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court, a harsh exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants the already twice postponed Brexit on 31. October, if necessary, also without a deal with the EU.
It's not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The plant sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a 'walk in the park'
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on opponents of Brexit in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hate, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy was a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. “We enjoy this. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament harshly in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" of the people. Accusations that he could put MPs at risk because they could become the target of death threats, he dismissed as a "humbug."
Cummings said the only way to calm down again was if MPs would finally respect the British's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect," it said in a statement. “And we should listen too.”
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for U.N. intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. “If this goes badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst.” The United Nations would have a responsibility to Kashmir. “You should have prevented that.”
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers rule a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby abruptly increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding with a hard hand against the current protests in Egypt. She shoots at the population with live ammunition, over 2000 detainees join the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. Yet since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like in the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the el-Sisi regime does not get to grips with, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, one in three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, with the inflation rate at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression, but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was examined whether the complicated system mesh for BER fire protection works in combination. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not finished at the BER yet.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said there were still deficiencies in the terminal to be processed. “We have a lot of detailed topics, but we don’t have a real showstopper.” He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be carried out on the processing of the deficiencies," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it was about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release yet for all the dowels on which the cable lines hang. The airport chief expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoke aprons that shut down like a canvas in a fire so the smoke doesn't spread. They're going down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen from two billion to around €6.5 billion since construction began in 2006.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why it is scheduled to be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18. October go, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, while head of human resources Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm footing.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up a number of vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region had risen sharply. There was a million damage!
The police apprehended a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for the cause of explosives explosions in crime unit with particularly serious case of theft, which were led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the prey, he has apparently financed his narcotics addiction." Four times alone, the bomber had between 20. August 2018 and 31. May 2019 Parking ticket machines blown up on Bürgerstraße.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody. The police investigation against him is ongoing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further vending machine explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA acquires Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a press spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman said. Flight times are to be adjusted for connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device would be operated. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights departing under AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair aircraft including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's fight announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time, countered AUA board member Andreas Otto on Friday: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: In the Italy holidays early month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
“We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to be actually married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018, according to British media reports, said in the official message.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years with love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately posted on her Instagram account.
A royal celebration
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. The palace will announce more information about the date, location and everything else in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a festival similar in size to the wedding of Eugenie on the 12th. October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with €12.5 million. The Davos High Mountain Hospital, which is owned by the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved from Switzerland.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it said. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes of the DNA - so-called mutations - are known, it said the hospital. Every year, about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also benefit in the study of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New insights into the interaction between the heart and the brain, the heart and kidneys as well as cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine will be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics will be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had been operated on the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. When decoding genetic materials, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
The genetic material of a human being can be decrypted within 24 hours today, according to the UKE. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to take place on 1. Start in October, and all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by the end of 2020. The following year, initial results are expected.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the sometimes still minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo announced. “The victims were abused. Some of them said they had been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The young were detained under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved." In fact, the protégés had been held by their teachers in "most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained up in a small room.
The Koran school has existed for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents would have shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They would have guessed nothing of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koranic schools. They replace the often deficient state facilities. The people of the region are suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Police officers have freed nearly 400 students from appalling circumstances at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children had been discovered on Thursday after a tip-off in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "inhumane." Officers arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept like slaves at their school and laid on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a recognizably poor health condition.
World footballer's election: Further allegations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Football 'signature not valid'
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe honoured
With a gala in Milan, the world football federation Fifa honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world footballer's election, allegations come to Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not even scored - with a curious justification.
Much at Fifa has proved to be disgusting in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa world footballer election has so far not been suspected of being unclean - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now coming to light: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
Fifa apologises in that "the signatures on the election forms have been in capital letters and therefore not valid." The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach also amazed
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was eventually scored: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was also received, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details about my voice are false, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Federation simply voted on its behalf.
From the association came on Friday the news: True, but was of course no intention. The completed election documents had been "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said in a message from the association. But the second captain Manuel Rosas was elected. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," the notice said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte, however, had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
Fifa is now examining the other cases in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was externally overseen by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer's election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Senior Republicans speak out in favour of official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against U.S. president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. “Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established.” He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the deposition of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, few have shown unease because of it. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already opposed Trump’s policy several times, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. “The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it.”
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore especially symbolically important. Still, first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second House of Representatives, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that internally, the first cracks were occurring among the Republicans.
The affair could lead to the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could make a so-called impeachment effort. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been removed from office by an impeachment trial.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she illegally visited the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - including from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted again after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious allegations against Rackete are being made. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been arrested at a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but do not have any secured information about it ourselves," "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the German Press Agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tormented and even murdered in the North African country. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the notice said at the time.
NGOs and aid agencies are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. “We can’t scan who the people are. Those come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. “It is therefore very important that this is investigated.”
Italy's right-wing former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk seeks Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, achieving its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures will have to be generated in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
US budget dispute: Again just a bridge financing
The new fiscal year will be in the US on 1. Start October without a decent budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has transitional funding until the 21st. November decided.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending caps for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, the United States faces the one on the 1st October beginning new fiscal year once again without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has a transitional funding (CR) until 21. November decided. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year, which will end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the Federal Administration cannot, therefore, from the 1.3 organic to 1.4 bio for the new financial year. $ Extended Spending Framework Benefit.
Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. The spending laws, however, reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely capable of a majority.
The spirits differ mainly on the topic of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying, 12 billion. To force $ for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s great priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military constructions and projects. The dispute over the wall was already escalating in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the wall, the ghosts separate
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding over the 21st. November out. Even a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the backdrop of Congress' ongoing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in a timely manner, and the associated threat of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity. Template S. In 1877, in order to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year’s level, prevent the travel activities of the parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination should also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill from the government, according to which all women can claim in vitro insemination. This is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The bill still requires Senate approval. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that numerous "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Episcopal Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm further banned by dead husband
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to her dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem." In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain of the surrender of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the advance in Paris argued that a child so conceived would then carry a "particularly difficult fate."
Numerous members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, on the other hand, had advocated for the artificial insemination with the sperm of the late partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" if her desire to have children remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot father children. You must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, it is often difficult.
Compensation for the climate: Calls for flight delivery for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate levy paid there in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under pressure internally.
Universities should also be limited to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion postponed before the summer break about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges is getting back into momentum. After the state rectors' conference reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a university of education advocate compensation for service flights. This is as a first step "urgently necessary", at the same time there must be a broad debate about the avoidability of flights, it said in her opinion. The cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is meanwhile still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the proposal of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, those arrested are alleged to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of gunfire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the Coast Guard of Russia, according to its own information, to protect its marine biological resources, drives patrols.
30,000 squid seized
During the renewed inspections, 30,000 squids were discovered on the boats and seized. In addition, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motorboats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans even after lawsuits by domestic entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future, only 18,000: US lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives at the White House.
The richest country on earth is sealing itself off against people seeking protection: As the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees is further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis in particular will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, the U.S. State Department said. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's predecessor administration, far higher admissions limits had applied.
The targeted cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980. The State Department nevertheless described the U.S. as the "most merciful and generous nation in history," a formulation strongly reminiscent of the US president's language.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to ensure that the refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of encouragement from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. To be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelenskyy affair and a possibly looming impeachment.
According to the foreign office, the U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State Department statement. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, are expected to accept a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The U.S. wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. With this in mind, the United States has first signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration on the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders orangutan release from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a catchment station for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. Born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo, Sandra was granted the rights of a "non-human person", which is why her release was imperative. The animal was taken to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilogram human abe is not able to adapt to life in the wild, she will live in the open-air enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees housed, among them "Bubbles," former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to go through a roughly 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 animal rights trial for "Sandras" has helped to convert the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. A research and education centre for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built there by 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride at the almost 3000-meter-high Great Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double bottom or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-meter-high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. With that, he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
U.S. sporting goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit increase, despite the trade conflict with China. Net income rose to $1.4 billion (just under €1.3 billion) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is above all the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
Revenues rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August. The most strong increase in the Nike sales figures in China with an increase of 22 percent. The company from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon thus benefited from its approach to addressing consumers directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures - the sporting goods maker's shares rose more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about soccer pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifetime stadium ban against a fan. Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then posted the private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter should never again attend a game of the club, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. “We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa president Gianni Infantino had said over the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants in the first league game between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
But there have also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. Italian authorities have now slapped 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, police said. For the rest, therefore, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had started the investigation with an ad last year.
The ultra-leaders are said to be behind the black trade with tickets, according to Italian media reports. They would have "controlled the ticket trade for the fan curve" and are said to have blackmailed Juventus staff to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are thought of with grippy designations. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
“The crabs are coming!” With this call started on the 21. September officially the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also marks the opening event of the 19th. China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival has been ushered in, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. In ecological terms, the city has ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already started crab breeding in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a defining industry that has made for high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as a technique-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services," and has carefully built the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending." In this way, the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local advantages through the connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as flagships to intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, and companies for organic agriculture, which are leaders in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone and of national places of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape were integrated, the state of buildings for citizen services and for the public service was comprehensively improved, the areas of "tourism +" and "+ tourism" were vigorously developed and the development of cultural tourism was promoted at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and US: Rouhani speaks of end to sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, after returning from the U.N. General Assembly, has spoken of an alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions. The United States had promised in return for talks with the Tehran leadership an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Rouhani describes the event this way: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had urged a meeting to take place. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," Rouhani added. The nature of the punitive measures that were to be ended was up for debate. “And they clearly said we were lifting all sanctions.”
However, this advance was not made in an acceptable manner, criticized Rouhani. In view of the punitive measures in force and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier in the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Major earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes have been rocked by two earthquakes within a very short time, fears of disaster are growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This raises concerns about disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8-magnitude earthquake had on Thursday rocked the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - made, among other things, by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which have been registered in the centre as refuges, have long since been built. First to the 20. The anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as the disaster management agency Afad announced. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for safety reasons. Some students cried, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly rocked by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that a magnitude earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could be looming. But when the earthquake will occur is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies draft contingency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after returning from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings would have suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from Istanbul's Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were broken. It was more violent than Tuesday’s, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is given as 13:59 (local time). Just minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock, according to CNN Turkey, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, a 4.6-magnitude earthquake had rocked Turkey's Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions, said the disaster management authority Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It had become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. “Sooner or later, the great quake will come.”
Already a few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake triggered great worries also in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also quaked at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide for new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment, the U.S. Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president contains important evidence for investigations against the president. Trump once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt." He also disputed the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane diverted
Because a female passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight has been diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
In an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be freed from the narrow cabin. She was locked up in it for about an hour, US media wrote, citing other passengers. For the onward flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the plane.
In a video circulated on the Internet, which according to US media is said to have come from Flight 1554, several people can be seen trying to free the woman. “We’re working on opening the door right now, ma’am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative "The Transformation," British success writer Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" (originally: "The Cockroach") will be on 27. November in German, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams" who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to let nothing and no one stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions beg the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write.” McEwan only published the novel "Machines Like Me" about Artificial Intelligence in the spring.
Kafka’s story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and sees himself “transformed into a tremendous vermin”, is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that is head," Diogenes Verlag said.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are given whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has all trips up to and including 31, a day after its bankruptcy filing. October 2019 cancelled. Travel "could not be started for insolvency reasons," the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. How it's about travel with start from the 1. November 2019 stands, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the pull of the British parent company's bankruptcy and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money again from now on hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still house Thomas Cook holidaymakers, are to receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman told the German Press Agency. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not requested or otherwise coerced by these hotels from now on for the individual payment of hotel bills," spokesman Bernd Engelien said.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to data from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced withdrawals to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help the travellers who are currently still on the road. Things are looking bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday. Late Thursday night, the company announced all travels up to and including 31. October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that are already paid for.
How it's about travel with start from the 1. November 2019 stands, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out about the possibilities of refunding the travel price on the Kaera website and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosives mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue shrapnel vest, Britain's Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he made the ignition circle on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she was walking at the time. The pictures, in which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997, had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day Africa trip since Monday, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stalling Brexit negotiations: The threat of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly decided: with him there will be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations guaranteed. But what statements are of eternal duration in the polarizing Briton. The Supreme Court's latest ruling in Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonde. His suspension of parliament to be able to carry out his Brexit course stubbornly until the exit date was annulled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament requires Johnson to, in the event of failed negotiations with the EU, by 31. October to bring about an extension of bilateral talks. However, Johnson had categorically ruled out that again and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
Yet the pressure doesn't seem to be noticeably past Johnson either. Meanwhile, during a visit to a hospital, he made insinuations that in the event of a non-agreement until the end of October, he supported an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best of all, a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work out.
And time is gradually running away from Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have around six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal. But even the recent talks have not made a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the exit date is in force. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words, however. She fears Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injured in this context, said the US health authority CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 people affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been reported. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the US.
Fears of new protests in Egypt grow
The videos of Mohammed Ali were shared on online networks millions of times. The contractor and actor, who lives in Spain, calls for a "people's revolution" in it. For today Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with a million participants in central squares in the country.
The security agencies are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was already observed. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. In recent days, the police had already stepped up their road checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly on messages and photos related to the protests.
On the 20. In September, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces reacted accordingly harshly to this. According to the human rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW said, citing lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. The government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs has returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted, among other things, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar explorer said. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak. We have known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place to the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the impact of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenlandic glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
The polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Struggle for a Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World's Oceans" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," skipper Boris Herrmann said at the award ceremony. “He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades.”
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
“Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We urge the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Promptly came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this cannot be taken from the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, said the innkeeper.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face impeachment after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower's accusation, which ultimately brought the conversation out of concern for national security and U.S. democracy with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize another country's government for an influence on the 2020 election. He had exploited the dependence of Ukraine in the process and thus wanted to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be traced in the now published transcript of the conversation with Zelensky, although it does not reproduce the full text. The phone call of the 25. July, however, is just one episode of a much larger story, at the center of which, in addition to Trump, is above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's perspective in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Zelensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to," he tells the newspaper. You might think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal about that." Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor appears to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct a reason for the Russia investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is about exactly the investigations, which Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Zelensky in July. The version Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, had pushed as Ukraine representative of the Obama administration for the dismissal of then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin. This is to stop the investigation he was responsible for by the gas company, on whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden senior has financially blackmailed Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was slightly different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general had to leave, the investigation into the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Shokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the U.S. government was by no means the only Western partner to push for his dismissal. In addition, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Germany, Great Britain and Spain in particular are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 15.30. Instagram also outputs the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbance, though not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. More often affected by disturbances
It's not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been down for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users are also resorting to Twitter to make their anger air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were travelling by a dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in misfortune - taking less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter for the salvage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, at just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable boat.”
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, where 19 scientists work. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently been launched on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature puts battery to
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers, on the other hand, always measured over 30 degrees even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, temperature is a crucial factor for battery life. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last so long. The service life is therefore lower. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always associated with high costs for modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of battery replacement even again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Just put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and laborious plug-in fumbling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which even Apple participates exceptionally, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, said his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has already made international headlines: He is a photo that went viral in the spring of the time of mountaineers standing in line on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass rush sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-metre-high mountain and highest peaks on Earth. In May, eleven climbers had died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th. Eight-thousanders: Currently, Chinese authorities are closing the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is, among other things, bad weather. Earlier week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. “We suspect the elephants were poisoned.”
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous former rock fortress of Sigiriya, which was visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
Sri Lanka is estimated to be home to only about 7,000 elephants. Their killing is theoretically subject to the death penalty.
British oil tanker detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was announced by the shipping authority Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the British-flagged tanker on the 19th. July, on charges of disregarding rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's management in criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to comprehensively investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It should be about the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not want to financially support the struggling company for survival. "Our interest is in the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors," said committee chair Rachel Reeves in London. “Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management greed.”
According to experts, genes are overestimated at colon cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family-level increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family dietary habits, are therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously thought. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it said in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he intends to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit figures will have to be generated in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Does the UK government want to evade Brexit law? Johnson cautious
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered over whether to look for ways to circumvent the law recently passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. When asked about this, he said on Friday in front of journalists only that his government will abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date, should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to evade the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that will postpone the entry into force of the law to the period after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. “We are confident that the EU will take to 31. To leave October, and the best way is to get the one with an agreement.”
Iran apparently ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing ineptitude or unwillingness when it comes to concrete action," Rouhani said Thursday at a news conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they did not stand by their promises, he promised "further steps" away from the agreements of the painstakingly negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which in return included the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The U.S. single-handedly withdrew the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in Middle East policy deemed aggressive. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new deal with tougher conditions and is now again counting on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by restarting the uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium, or at least prepared them for use. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build up more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are unwilling to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani presumed. However, there will still be further talks that hopefully will bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had confessed to the attack, but this was considered a false confession by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rouhani reiterated his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations need to provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders could not have done that in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would first have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to pivot to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet from other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was only possible before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused interest from astronomers around the world.
The widely traveled comet was on 30. August was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be sighted during a flight through our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into an alien solar system from up close before it disappears in no time at all. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. space agency Nasa reported in a note.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic track that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. She is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov by it, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted approaching. Thus, the researchers remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be on display with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. “After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020.”
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers in a first study. Footage from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii shows a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and that indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León’s colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such trip visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet interceptor) at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, she should either lurk on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70. The birthday of the People's Republic is the time: At the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger aircraft of the China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the $450 billion project. China's most recent prestige project is also called "starfish" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - and much smaller - capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has so far been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: From London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the UK Space Agency is dreaming of. This flight, which is targeted for the 2030s, is to make a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," agency chief Graham Turnock told the broadcaster. “We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced.”
To push the project forward, the UK space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. The Concorde was the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date from 1976 until the cessation of its operation in 2003 had covered the New York-Paris route and took three to three and a half hours to complete. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, U.S. aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane." Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "next generation of truly reusable cream travel equipment".
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power of the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump told staff from the U.S. Embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned is almost "a spy" and in the past, one was "a little different" with such than today.
This was seen as an intimidation attempt against tipsters. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media outlets circulated audio recordings of the address on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the descriptions of the whistleblower had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the U.S. president is "using the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This involves previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: Leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was produced. However, this was removed from a database usually provided for this purpose after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation log has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the source's credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that had turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no tipsters or spies at all.
How Trump expressed in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower, but sparked outrage. U.S. House of Representatives Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern and complained that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the administration.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been going on for months in various committees. In the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with renewed investigations to set in motion a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 previous U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, who were majority-based among Democratic but also among Republican presidents, stood behind the investigation launched by Democrats for possible impeachment proceedings in a statement released Friday. Should the allegations prove true, that would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise schedule for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been removed from office by an impeachment trial.
VW works council: Jobs will be cut 'creepingly'
The VW brand's plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the carmaker's works council around. The brand aims to reduce its annual factory costs of tens of billions of euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, €500 million will be saved this year.
A key to this is personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated in 2016 between companies and works council already envisages the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are actually not available for disposition, are "creepingly" cut via another route - i.e. past the official course. Thus, vacancies of regular vacancies would often not be refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the re-occupation. In the meantime, there is a lack of staff in many places, the work compaction is increasing, the worries of a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only: "An adjustment of the employment volume is as agreed to socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and centrally manage new projects. This should also reduce costs and also speed up decisions - this is the aim of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann, Member of the Board of Management, said at a managerial conference in Berlin: “Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof.”
There are already successes in this way: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. In front of journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which was on the 24th. October in Wolfsburg is to be presented, shortened by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper it is round in the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies to VW internally that 800,000 cars must be built there annually in order for the plant to be satisfactory profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test method.
As production board member Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg "in perspective". This should make the bundling of the Golf production in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant hands over the Golf production by the conversion to the site for electric car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, he is to remain the Wolfsburg bread-and-butter car for the time being.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: Traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been slaved with oaths, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged traffickers have to go to jail for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women, who wanted to leave, had to take a ritual oath in their homeland in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatables. The dream of a better future, however, was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wages were therefore completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted to the infiltration and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the sentencing. “Some were properly disgusted.”
The verdicts are on commercial and gang-like infiltration of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants union UFO has once again threatened to strike.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "on the 14th October about the industrial action in the LH Group inform," said UFO tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with UFO for months. This also raises the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, UFO now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court dismissed the motions. The company confirmed the decision and is considering appeals against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think is unlikely," said UFO board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to review the status of UFO as a trade union. The company argues the union has not appointed a representative board for months and is thus unable to fill its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, in the course of which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board have resigned, including the long-time union boss Nicoley Baublies. UFO had suspended an initial vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July because of doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But that's supposed to change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors will be increased to 100 million per year, said the tourism commission.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the tourism commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik, as well as the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production slumped sharply, oil price shots skyrocketed. It is likely to be several weeks before the kingdom's oil production reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stuck in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding feast. The model posted several party photos on her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time), in which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram, among others, and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry in church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes-word a year ago in a New York registry office. There was no major celebration at the time.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two killed in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a wooded area near the city of Mecin (Metchin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday night after the crew emitted a distress signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes for the threat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. Of these, 265 are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 would already be at the highest level of danger and thus before the extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "at risk," "highly endangered," "at risk of extinction" and "extinct in nature." In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Ebere ash and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, especially Ebereschen (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German press Agency. “Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by transforming or weakening their habitats.”
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat, in addition to a mushroom, is the Balkan minier moth. It has been spreading from south-eastern Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and moss and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and were an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europa office. “We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority.”
Istanbul earthquake: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths, according to the data. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The 5.8-magnitude earthquake had on Thursday rocked the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now, the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth's plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. Authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It doesn't get any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is very excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On the 2. February 2020 will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the halftime show. “Now it’s even more special because the NFL has been around for 100 years and I’m going to perform with another Latina.” “I can’t wait to show what we girls can do on the world’s biggest stage.”
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to stand alongside another female artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world. “And then on my birthday!” The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" stand together on a stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the US. Even if you have dropped viewership numbers recently, this February, the spectacle in the US attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been turmoil around the half-time show of the past Super Bowl in advance: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to his knees in the 2016-17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been club-less since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to find the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook dearly, according to a press report. There is a threat of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the Financial Times in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to pay a total of up to £1.8 billion (around 2 billion) on their books. Euro) make, according to the report. This would have been shown by estimates from the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Bond creditors would have to write off depreciation of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders between £550 and $825 million. Buying pounds. The amounts to be actually written are likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, said an expert to the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end, will be shown after the expiry of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not exude too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s approximately 40 aircraft in the UK are “old” and many of the properties are in poor locations. The most money could probably be made with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it said.
Rackete allegedly brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but do not have any secured information about it," the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, told the news agency dpa.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. “They come without passports.”
Carola Rackete had on 29. June illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa and rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are also said to have arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
US warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told Handelsblatt, with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that requires every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief continued. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has meanwhile agreed to require suppliers to "declare of trustworthiness."
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the “Handelsblatt”, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not just the hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company to which the company allegedly owns is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the Handelsblatt.
The United States has evidence that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the U.S. position.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: Schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical plant. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, said the responsible prefecture. The Interior Ministry had urged citizens to stay in buildings as much as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no casualties. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and stop the crop for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that odor will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the scene of the fire.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol company's factory, which manufactures additives for oils. The production facility is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso, near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told news channel BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had initially been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine cannot be ruled out. In the river, dams against the pollution had been built, said the prefecture.
The fire broke out early in the morning at around 02.40, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French finance minister: "Germany must invest and now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investment to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Action would have to be those states that would have room for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these room for manoeuvre, the minister added, pointing to his country's high public debt. This is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilised" and "lowered," Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get a grip on its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. New debt is set to fall to 2.2 percent, down from an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. When asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician avoids.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered over whether to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by parliament, which exactly that is to prevent. When asked by this, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to evade the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that will postpone the entry into force of the law to the period after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. “We are confident that the EU will take to 31. To leave October, and the best way is to get the one with an agreement.”
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, declared that he perceives the political disputes over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and expressed confidence that the desired EU exit still comes about: "We enjoy this, we will win, we will (note d. Red.: leaving the EU), don't worry," Cummings told the British newspaper Telegraph at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the "Vote Leave" Brexit campaign during the 2016 election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now acts as chief strategist in the UK's government seat of Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policies that have led the Premier into an almost hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. The illustrious guests also included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made them, a few hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries."
It's portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," art critic Ekow Eshun writes in his foreword. And, of course, one thing is always in the center: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland, they also lived a normal life. So Mary McCartney said, according to the BBC, that she would have slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it hasn't always been cleansed up with the McCartneys either.
Like no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The footage of Linda McCartney is certainly a kind of family diary, but they're very much more than pure snaps.
It’s about the deciding click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment," Paul McCartney said. “If you shoot two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the gift of always catching just the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the picture detail and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all anecdotal things, is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the just-released Beatles album "Abbey Road," which was released exactly 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran”
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country despite U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cut off oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey was having trouble importing Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn "because of the U.S. threats."
Despite this, Turkey will "especially continue our relations with Iran on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The U.S. has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear deal with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the slump in Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
U.S. government seeks to restrict refugee admission
The U.S. government wants to dramatically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said Thursday that the annual cap on a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. That's equivalent to a 40 percent cut.
The State Department said the U.S. would remain committed to supporting refugees. The most important task, however, is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. The U.S. immigration system is currently overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus in the future on the admission of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are in danger, according to the State Department statement. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, are expected to accept a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettled in the USA. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When U.S. President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was close to 85,000.
Aid agencies reacted appalled to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," International Rescue Committee chief David Miliband said. The United States would thus further damage its leadership in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - legally and illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has slammed corresponding clues to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spy," Trump said, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is reported by several US media outlets in agreement.
Trump spoke in front of employees of the U.S. mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied: "This comes close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we were doing in old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now.”
Observers evaluated the latter remark on a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats drew sharp criticism of Trump's remarks and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceedings against him, wrote the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower, in a now-released complaint, accuses the president of abusing his office to ask for another country's interference in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to initiate investigations against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informant are. However, according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is an analyst from the CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Again and again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. Regularly, the often too small boats capsize. In the sinking of a dinghy, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
Seven migrants have died in the sinking of a dinghy in front of the Greek island of Chios. Among the fatalities were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floodwaters by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a smuggler, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr reported. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Which states the migrants come from is not yet known. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who breaks off concert
A US concert by rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of an indistance of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the appearance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it while it's still going."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology, adding that Daltrey "really can't speak now." Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money's worth at a reparation concert. However, a date has not yet been set.
The Who canceled appearances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. They are to be made up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly discontinued: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions in revenue.
The crisis of office landlord WeWork threatens to disturb the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had set off as chief executive just a few days ago founder Adam Neumann, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British “Financial Times reports that WeWork has stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect. This means that, among other things, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office space for the long term and rents it to members in the short term in partly small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company posted a $1.6 billion loss, at $1.8 billion in revenue. This year alone, the rental costs are said to have increased to an estimated $2.5 billion from the rental of new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space on the market during this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have increased during that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider." The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in revenue. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. This is because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia arrested numerous North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coast guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested, who had fished illegally in the waters, said the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB, according to the agency Interfax on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shelled and three of them injured. This time, there were no casualties, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the Coast Guard of Russia, according to its own information, to protect its marine biological resources, drives patrols. During the new inspections, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motorboats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti agency, the Coast Guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans even after complaints from domestic entrepreneurs this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. The ships themselves also do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
In the arrests in the previous week, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian coast guard had been injured. According to the FSB, a North Korean man who was also wounded later died of his injuries. On that 17. In September, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
US imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department said in a statement Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations.” As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued travel bans, among other things, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. Venezuela has been raging for months, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition. The U.S. has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to its knees and help opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the U.S. and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. The start is likely to be made because of the time difference New Zealand and Australia, before the protests across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Protesters also wanted to gather outside the White House in Washington.
How big the global popularity will be this Friday after the previous week's record turnout is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. “Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we'll do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the inflow last Friday was very large. A good third of all global protesters - around 1.4 million - had taken part in the protests, according to estimates by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had sat down before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on their country’s politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has resulted in the Fridays-for-future movement within a short time. The climate protests are mainly attended by pupils and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the looming climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high-seas racing yacht. There, she had most recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN in which she spoke to the leaders of the world in the conscience. In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry told the Tass agency in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is due to be on 1. come into effect October.
Anyone who smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should spark a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also to grill meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - investigators excavate servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time excavated a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, through which internationally operating criminals operated their activities.
This was announced by the Attorney General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The darknet is a shielded part of the internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second-largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market" - which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Such a hoster had been excavated for the first time in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon, investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backbenchers?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21. century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in front of the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical feat or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is setting the masses in motion and getting young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to advocate for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get into the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently set out on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why do we need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers by her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even tried-and-tested followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably also too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own very well in the media worldwide and a lot of money is flowing thanks to the imposing action.
This is where the spirits are now divorcing: is it morally right to enrich yourself financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may make sense to question seemingly pious projects by certain trendsetters critically.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest cruises through our solar system
An alien comet is cruising our solar system at the moment.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently thwarting our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is thwarting our solar system at the moment. He was christened after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in Crimea. He looked into the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicions. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind to be spotted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch glimpses of an alien solar system from close range. Apparently, the Come is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system.
Comet was spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers can observe it in depth. Because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted approaching, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa. “After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020.”
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of tail staring is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León’s colleague Javier Licandro.
However, observation goes beyond individual insights. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Time and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely reprehensible': Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is getting more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the warlike language of the premier as "tasteless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation," "fraud," contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and keeps upgrading - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, other critics have come forward: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, long drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She thinks this is extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who had competed in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK."
She was particularly struck by the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly lower house MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memory can best be honored by going through Brexit, had said Boris Johnson in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to an MP who was murdered by someone who shouted 'Britain first,'" Johnson's sister said. The perpetrator had obviously come from the far-right camp, which felt "enhanced by this kind of language." For all those who mourned her, be it very tasteless.
Cox's widower also sharply criticised the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to stand up for what you believe in passionately and decisively, no matter what you think of. But we must never demonize the other side. He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had resigned his post as secretary of state and his mandate as A Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest over the past few months - it's an unresolvable tension," Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country." In a joint statement, they said: "Over the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
The NFL is setting a strong mark in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots perform. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the U.S. football league NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
“I am incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo. Because this one has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will play its 100th anniversary next year. Birthday celebrates, finds on the 2. February in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many also consider the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policies.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, the NFL finals are watching well over 100 million TV viewers, it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
There was political controversy in the run-up to last year. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise in protest against police violence against blacks, while playing the national anthem and had been tackled harshly by US President Donald Trump, among other things. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had turned down a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 performed was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber puts Egypt's ruler: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence over whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt have spent the past week both abroad. One of them floated back in at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who deposed Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's crackdown on political Islam and lost no syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest the president. He has "no cause for concern," Sisi said at the airport into the microphones of state television. “The Egyptians cannot be misled.”
Leading astray - that, according to the president, tries to mislead - this is what is currently being done on the streets is trying to do. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-setting voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea rooms: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets," Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He tackles the head of state directly and in a thoroughly rustic language. While the people are starving, the president revels in luxury and can be built with magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a contractor, he seems to know pretty much exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the downright exploding click numbers show.
After last week's first demonstrations against his rule since Sisi's grip on power, thousands had been arrested and nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million-dollar march" for this Friday. That so many people would really venture onto the streets was unlikely. But there were occasional smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, the participants of Al-Sisi accused of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, police also deployed tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be independently verified at first. Security sources said police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters tore banners with the president's portrait to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the outage roads. In Cairo, several metro stations in the city centre were closed because of "maintenance work," most of the roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim brother Morsi entrenched themselves in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a big rally for the president here of all places.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona to his video camera. “Let’s not clash with police officers.” However, this is not to be understood as a retreat: "All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not have to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer center Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the consumer center Bavaria on its page.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. Those affected are best done this in writing by registered enrollment.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and possibly also claim damages. But with the lack of success, only the way to complain will help.
First senior Republican for inquiry
As the first senior Republican, Vermont's governor has advocated for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined," Phil Scott said at a news conference Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the deposition of the president - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Because Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have shown unease because of it. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump's policies several times, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man to stay in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the Avengers universe. It was unclear how the films around Tom Holland should proceed.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home." This is reported by several US media outlets in agreement. According to this, the cinema release should already be determined: In the USA, the film is to be announced from 16. July 2021 start.
Writing in Screenrant magazine, Marvel boost Kevin Feige said: "I'm excited to have Spidey's journey continue at the MCU. Me and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to star in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring.”
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony is said to have made an offer to Marvel. According to industry magazines, the Disney company, which includes Marvel, would contribute 30 percent of the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the 'Suits' finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode there were a lot of happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who played in the series for many years, were also paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing first: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell greeting than Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospective once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomes him after his sentence.
Yet even her real husband, Prince Harry, was casually mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course, in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) straightens towards the altar to marry his fiancee Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. The confused Harvey wants to know from the groom whether he actually threw himself over a frock coat, only to then snippishly note: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
While capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children drowned. A total of seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coast guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he intends to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU commissioner, he wants to "inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation," Seehofer said on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens, in order to be able to help with the management.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer's planned trip with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants continue to arrive from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This stipulates that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is progressing only painstakingly on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are waiting for just under 29 400 people, according to the Citizens' Protection Ministry. The worst situation is on Lesvos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 have there been so many, reported the state broadcaster.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "quite certainly" one of the biggest challenges facing the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time to create and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular disease, the elderly and diabetics are affected.
Greens politician must answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Party leader holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has gone unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also disseminated to the media - and there the cup was still a sneerous (cardboard) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Greens leader must answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party was producing fake news to appear more credible on the issue of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which Trudeau is also having an increasingly difficult time because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media, fueling discussion about fake news. One user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and said on her blog that she did not know about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. But the one, she put it right, was made of bamboo. She always brought him. A spokeswoman for the party said it was just a matter of housing the party logo in the picture, not covering up anything. Only a snippet of the photo can be seen on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she tells the Guardian, and at the same time asked for something from her over-committed team: "If they feel like editing a picture again, they couldn't do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of single-use plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate on holiday ice cream with plastic spoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Get an upgrade for the business class spontaneously - that's what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from economy class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng is followed by more than 65,000 users on Instagram. On the 30. May she is from Taiwan to New York and on 7. June flown back.
On the outbound flight, staff refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had presented an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. The influencer wants to have received the letter from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they followed up at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail is allegedly originated is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. That also confirmed the mail system, where the messages did not show up.
Airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (around 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Although Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains locked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline doesn't want to settle for that - and is now turning on a lawyer.
Oil prices give way after report on Yemen ceasefire
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in noon on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger for the price slide was a Wall Street Journal report on a Yemen ceasefire. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production to a standstill in mid-September. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war-torn country of Yemen had reclaimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand worries, Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank told Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are thus continuing its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost up to nearly $59, while Brent had nearly $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg had reported, citing insiders, that repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than thought after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases, citing insiders who report rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. But commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was indicated in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still anchored, shipping company chief Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that it would move missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian arch-enemy. Fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the UK have at times pushed up oil prices significantly in recent weeks.
Allegations against Trump intensify
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees have made an intense effort to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon come in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the summit's decisions the previous year, North Korea's adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry said. He also criticized tightening U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. But he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision of Trump, so that it comes again to a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with Kim before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Korean states. In doing so, they agreed to revive the consultations, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers to help with mine clearance
Dressed in a blue splinter protection vest, Britain's Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he made the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which have not helped to clear away to commit to aid".
Pounds under pressure - rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculation of an early rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is adding to the pound sterling. The British currency edged up as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by comments by central banker Michael Saunders. This brought a rate cut into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, since the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, given that Saunders is considered an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of brokerage firm ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the strains on the economy caused by the Brexit hickhack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants his country if necessary without a divorce agreement to the 31st running October from the EU.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, one-time director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Athletics Championships, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even to some extent back. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sport. Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes from the country compete under a neutral flag, while 168 Russian athletes competed at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to attend the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer they were even allowed to take place in Russia with the host as a participant.
Positive findings missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," David Howman said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Friday. “We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada was received by a whistleblower and the ones it received from the Russians in January.” Many positive findings were missing, which had been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The athletics association is the only organization to hold on to the spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in the room and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens to ban the Rusada again and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
