The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the negative against the close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ's shares reached nearly half of normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to build on Monday's slump right at the start of Tuesday's deals, when it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the slump was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is also evident.
Case of shares in Asia
The shares on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to make up for some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange's index in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to make up for some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five per cent, but then decreased losses to 4.3 per cent.
Taiwan's stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
"The timing for the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," according to Hong Kong's chief executive Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of China's central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, and pass the draft for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that other countries would also be affected by the slump.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan for support for the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (nearly Kč $12 trillion) should be spent.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar slump it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already dropped before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: U.S. government allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush has agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This is to be voted on early next week.
American lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a grant to the American financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee Barney Frank told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to various data, it could probably be voted on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a communication that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revitalization of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the night of Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are at our destination," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to calm investors before doing business in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of Congress could influence the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty about whether the negotiations at the last minute could fail because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
The law, however, will still undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress, however, can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush values progress in negotiations positively
The president has a veto power in this decision, but Congress can overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has persisted, which was based on gaining finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," according to Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "appreciates the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing off perks and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and sets up a committee to supervise the Fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it and made a big progress toward an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys up, with the goal being to lower the monthly cost to the debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
“This is because one does not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought.
That will be crucial to how the financial sector and government split the losses among themselves," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be passed now or early next week is not decisive, in Marek's view.
“Much more importantly, congressmen agree to support the plan and that they pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on the fact that there is a passing is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, overall they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the decline.
In contrast, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state governor Jörg Haider, is gearing up for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent, performed even worse.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially with the People's Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a really disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had withdrawn from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and previous Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's executive committee.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freiheitliche (FPÖ) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it had split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even had made sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who already declared that he is ready to work with every party and assumes that he is returning to Austrian federal politics, obviously relies on this development.
In addition, the Green Party moved into parliament, which suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not enter parliament.
Duel on Messer's cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls yet.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it is better to buy just one phone.
Despite all this, there are plenty of reasons why you should buy a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
I’m sure you’ll hardly buy a great expensive record player for home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
So this is also with the music when traveling, so with compressed music, simply put - music in MP3 format.
There are price and quality categories here too.
For some, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what cell phones can do, they don't even create hints.
No modern device is as universal as the phone to be used.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the squinting, it can play music and videos, record both, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and can maybe also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect that cheap mobile phones will not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you then call from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charging.
Another problem is when you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB termination, in addition, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can be finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
With players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, sorted according to the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the service life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is above all a backdrop for you and listen to it every day only briefly, for example, on the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which is really almost every mobile phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can handle.
MP3s are all creating, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or other provider) via mobile Internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in and of itself for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, reach for the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free kit.
If not, you can fall back on the built-in speaker, which almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically most sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players, in turn, lies in the ease of operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of a mistakenly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should be used now
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. B. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD u. e.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But Attention.
In the basic models, usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Belong to the more sophisticated listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will give you MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile operators are working among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps taken by the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile providers, on the other hand, like to scold the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
This is often agreed by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often stated in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is one more option - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers on the mobile phone market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile service providers had to react.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices to the market in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don’t have to look long for examples.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and text messages, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to rely on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose mobile-making - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický’s press secretary also doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual suppliers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the range of services."
In the Czech Republic, say the mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile-making.
“While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
It will be more likely to lead to a market entry of mobile in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, press spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector, has been showing its interest in a launch of a virtual mobile network provider for a long time.
“We have a keen interest in providing our customers with not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's press secretary adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far, we have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to continue to build on."
And she adds: "There will be hardly any virtual provider appearing on T-Mobile's network by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer to be able to think in the short term.”
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider from the point of view of customers to be the best.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be facilitated market entry?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ came at the moment when U:fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market was also recently strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the character of the mobile communications market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulators is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately has the competence to intervene in economic competition in Czech - in contrast to Great Britain and other highly developed countries.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem of his very typical attitude.
“The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure has been concluded.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS's Foreign Relations department in his response to our request.
From representatives of the providers, such a formulation would not be surprising.
This is more than worrying from an authority that should represent consumer interests and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián adds Chalupa: "Abroad, where virtual vendors operate normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
Really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile phone providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly only coincidence and the consequence of a fierce competition.
“The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter which indicate action against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile phone market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking for the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily assumes a dominant position in a certain segment.
But even if you do not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act the extension of the competences of ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS have to know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's already possible when no one is looking
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunication services, but these are only partly public.
Usually these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Our own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"Should there be cases that describe you, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the appropriate society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be talked about by those responsible for the mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a course of action.
From the activity of these companies, they do not flow to negligible profits, at the same time - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have full-fledged it like the normal customers of the mobile providers.
But that alone, the ČTÚ would at least have to seem strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Do the mobile providers turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to uncover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to settle for the explanation of the providers that they know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a significant price decline in the various services.
Virtually in all countries, where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their creation practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which did not attempt to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But we do not throw the shotgun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country in a ceremony on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was re-recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The singing version was taken by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young, representative voices that are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to maintain a clear diction for both and then with the choir, so that you understand the text well, so that a harmony is created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem next year celebrates its 175th anniversary. Anniversary.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the originally Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people adopted it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic component of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like
The Prague transport companies will also be transporting a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, the 1. October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague's public transport companies as a date on which the first passengers board a subway, tram or bus, who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can have a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1. January 2009) and have it installed on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available via the Internet on the website of the Verkehrsbetriebe www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have so far had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, the travellers also have a counter with trained staff available to advise interested parties on the Internet purchase and also play the coupon on the card," said the spokesman for the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be placed on the opencard at self-service machines, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket devaluers, the passengers may already have them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská noticed.
"Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon inspects a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
You just have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays up on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from municipalities of the Central Bohemians in particular reach the capital.
"In the trains belonging to Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have readers with which they can check the validity period of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the ticket office at the driver's office.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked location on the side of the checkout.
With this, the driver checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel by suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here, the information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans had asked in 1945 for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is according to a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US president in 1945.
This is according to a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," read a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten is dear."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia suggests the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume the patronage over the Bohemian Forest forever and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you grant this area to a foreign state that oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, it paints a good picture in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was employed in the war as a Budweiser German in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," Chalupa said.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be driven out of the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - pay then!
An emotion-packed campaign is aimed at motorists
Most expensive action for safety on the roads in Czech history.
This could also characterize the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's authority is promising to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on the radio, in the cinema, on the internet, but also on flyers.
It is supposed to dissuade the drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind you to bear before driving.
The campaign wants to speak to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers in conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people appealing to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - pay then!
The words "don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay" stands.
This is to mean that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It expects that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whip for the motorists
“For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when they drive at red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," according to Na Homolce Martin Kořán hospital traffic psychologist.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, panels that make drivers aware of a danger are already less effective.
"If you put up a static plaque that warns of danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has advocated the return of virtually all territories that were occupied in 1967, including the Jordan Country, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be made in exchange for it.
This he emphasized in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to forgo part of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, alluding to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple burber and sacred and historical places" that lie on the territory of the Old City.
“The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians know all too well what they have to do without to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to forego their present relationship with Iran; they will have to forego their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they grant to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it fails to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of unlawful gathering of beetles, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg could lead to some cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clear up, then sure, then there will be some cooling," he declared after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Despite everything, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the indictment and received a fine, the central government wanted the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case law the matter falls.
"His problem could be settled," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best to appeal to Mukherdshis, according to Mukherdshi's view, if he were to appeal to a higher authority.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also commented on negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the convicted person to "competent legal support," the Indian minister led.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a keen interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he reaffirmed the Czech Republic in front of his partner, the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
The minister evaded an answer to the question of whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I was already promised quite a lot," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus unlawful?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance coach, walking around is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers are allowed to walk back and forth while driving on the bus.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was likely caused by the truck's driver crossing the bus.
The young woman sat next to the driver at that moment to all the misfortune, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing places according to the vehicle certificate.
If this is not provided for in the bus, the travelers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance coaches have no standing places; which the company's director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
“We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not first agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was taken back, and we have reached a consensus that travelers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving when they have their seat," he shared his point of view.
The law knows no steward
“There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward – no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle attendant; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the spokesman for the Ministry Hanzelka clearly.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, thinks that the law subsequently covers this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That's all," he insists.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance coaches without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the professional
The BESIP specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
“With a smooth driving style, not many dangers threaten, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can hit his head."
“However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be cleared by the carrier through internal regulations," he says, and also thinks that this problem is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of steward is high-risk, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers when boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin justifies the lack of stewards on his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, we’ve been fighting back from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular-service bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had died, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the strip without blinking and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to dodge through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats for the stewards had been sold.
“These places cannot be reserved on long-distance connections, they are blocked.”
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but she also expects financial damages from the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise settlement of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation that a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working on for over a year.
“However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," according to expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of the travelers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses in the competence of the police and the occupational health and safety authorities.
A Czech judges the struggle around the bottom of the sea
It approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and, together with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member team of staff at the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements it on and to be added.
This is where work and enthusiasm reign.
The bottom of the sea so far has a little-known world that is rich in natural springs.
Here you can find oil, furthermore ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed, larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently registered their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
“In simple terms, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to fix the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide technical and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated over five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the latter three countries have had success," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia was recently met with an international response, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
Yet New Zealand is also a winner - the stretch of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission to the country last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, so about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement."
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is described by the convention as the "common heritage of humanity."
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold-digging country," says with some exaggeration Director Mikulka, adding that its "single areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
She shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This received in 1991 due to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Silent Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
“You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," according to another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concreteness as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, the legendary Schem that brought to life according to the Golem.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorf-based financial institution with Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter, which became known on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "block of competence" with sustainable earning power into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate capacity for action in a difficult time.
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government, is pushing the time to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk of a connection between Deka-Bank, which is known to savings bank customers because of its investment funds, and WestLB, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas let it be known when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is half supported by the Landesbanken and the savings bank associations, has instructed the Executive Board to hold discussions with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be about the capital markets business or parts of it.
Of course, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial centre in Frankfurt, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked for a moment that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this group of three became nothing.
No sooner had the plans become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba’s participation in it.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been mind games about a connection of the Deka bank with Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a coming together of the various houses of the public sector is in need.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, the first thing that could be closer to BayernLB’s connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, you will gradually run out of partners for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far far far far far far far far far far far fared far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A merger with West LB, in turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to it at the beginning of the year.
At best, stay the Nord LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of which business model the future viability of the Landesbanken should be ensured had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a disassembly of the West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, the letter from the local board also mentions that a "total solution" for the house is definitely sought.
How this can be brought together with the merger of individual units with the Deka-Bank will still be shown.
The second weekend of Wiesn is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, in the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded man and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers what low tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", start at 23.45 this evening, arriving expected to be 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus exclusively Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur-imitation lining and glasses with wide silver temples, own the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
75 euros costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed true to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates on the Autobahn 8 take a break just before Munich.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at half past seven o’clock in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attacking plan.
First, put the yellow cap on.
On it is "Oktoberfest" on the left, in fracture, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's time to run!" Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tipping.
“The security guards show that we are behaving well!
Once you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight point half past eleven to come back here!" Understood?
And already it's on to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
They want to be prepared for withdrawal.
It is the second weekend of Wiesn, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There is no precise information about figures; there is talk of 50 000 who make their way across the Alps and invade the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived this weekend especially from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts a national statistics in which the Italians occupy first place in front of Brits (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also weaves in that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because it has now occurred at the weekend.
The Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed on the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turmoil in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had refinanced himself at extremely short notice - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to €2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, income from attributions to receivables and certain securities, and from the resolution of provisions in the lending business by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream clearing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest in accordance with the tax code and from the business procurement for group companies, the earnings decline had still been moderate at around 16 percent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been spun off in Aareal Bank.
Because it earned too little in the classic state financing, Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciation and amortization, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is called quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two-thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market than other institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has once again largely dried up as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing annually for a part - around 50 billion euros - of Depfa's loan portfolio.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered with the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets."
From other sources, it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to take advantage of the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the momentum and uncertainties of the crisis, there is arguably no certainty.
It is even not unthinkable that the funding does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After late Sunday evening, according to the report, the bank was still facing insolvency, the at least provisional rescue can not calm the minds.
The share price slumped 75 percent to €3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, hold up quite well.
While the priority debt is barely moving, the prices of subordinated bonds yield more significantly.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the maturity beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If hypo-real-estate bonds previously seem a speculative investment alternative, their value after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the central banks, governments and less ailing commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or that comes in, which hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the coming 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are overwhelming with the partial nationalisation, the probability bordering on security has only become a legitimate hope at the moment.
This should especially prepare long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can at least use a final line to form a loss carry-forward for the future withholding tax payments on course gains of later years.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When things got serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9 were the aviation squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Technische Hilfswerk at the place of liberation.
However, as spokespersons for the ministries said on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostage takers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as support forces on the ground.
"Thankfully, it didn't come to that," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
Attackers had the tour group of the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on the 19th. 9/11 kidnapped in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the very end, as did the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
“The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before the way to school, I had bamble.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The start of classes does not seem to be as strictly fixed at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students trudge in from eight o'clock, until at twenty before nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lessons began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all whispered, giggled and waved and constantly I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly scurried to my place.
The girl next to me was grinning quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stormed.
Everyone was talking medd up and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - that's something different than the dull German sandwiches.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in tofu coat.
I usually don’t have a pale idea of what exactly I’m eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely novel.
What is certain is that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then prepares particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy better during the snack on breaks.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And to make me understand the comics and the culture in it better, I also started to learn a bit of Japanese.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And they are attached great importance to here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones rushed into the deep.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government's bailout for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties did not give there a majority for the program to curb the chaos in financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to approve, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't even occurred yet," he acknowledged.
Still, in the course of the vote, the Dow Jones slumped by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason was investor concerns, the state bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the failure became known, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turmoil in the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the program, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger does this mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could you check if they feel the same thing when they behave similarly to us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of sensation or, more generally, consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it turns up dead, flees or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits, which are almost always associated with human consciousness, include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
Thus, at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man even differs from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible in a scientifically way.
One could examine the processes of consciousness of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially using the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the formation of visualization.
What now results for the sensations?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely tied to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and especially humans.
Combined with linguistic nature, fine gradations of the sensation arise, because with the help of the words and the grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others in addition to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unproven.
Pankseep argues that what seems to be fearful in rats and people, probably feels like this in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same thing if they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger of whether it also feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity in behavior cannot yet prove any equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and people have similar brain strains, scrapes, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this for humans: How did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is waving here, provided that the same is measured in rats and people.
Just as I do not research language and consciousness in rats, nor do I know whether they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather make progress than run against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championships together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is possible that even the number of EM stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We now have to work at top speed," Ukrainian association president Grigoriy Surkis said.
“UEFA will keep a constant eye on us.”
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended from the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of acting according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the Euro 2012 will not suffer.”
Several first division players had been convicted last season alone for manipulation to forced relegation, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Organizers record rising booking figures
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales for travel bookings for the coming months have increased significantly compared to the previous year – even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the travel appetite of the Germans remains unclouded, according to a study.
When booking for the winter season, the rice offices recorded an increase in sales of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in sales of travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these results are figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the USA in particular is in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the increase in bookings is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic areas are particularly sought-after destinations among the Germans.
Package holidays in particular are very popular, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs of energy and food, the costs are “better calculable for the customer than in the individually organized holiday”.
Consumers could save money through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, among other things, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there would be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in the interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her past Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
The foams - and hits back.
Late Rose War with ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting an unsightly dispute with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud only found out to her after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Outrageous" was it, the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews and re-seals the history of our relationship."
It is also “unfortunate” that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that a divorce means for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father to twins.
And so his admissions conclude with the slash: "My life goes on anyway.
I appreciate myself lucky that I have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The Company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant slump in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays have already cheapened in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed were still up by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a "decreasing travel appetite of American tourists" as the cause of this.
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with a 26.3 percent increase.
The trend in the first quarter was also upwards in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene, travelers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, economy-class airline tickets prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class price changes were far smaller.
In Germany, prices plummeted even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices were up 11.9 percent, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price slump is on the one hand the slackening economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation was the cancellation of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, this was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the leader of the standings.
At the Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning elf.
From Kristoffer Klein increase crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher didn't get into the game until late and failed to hit the bar with a lifter.
His message was precisely worded, she was convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin of the Hamburg arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some past actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation was absent.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have "wished for it more relaxed".
The hamburgers owe the 1:0 (1:0) to the header of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify that," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate certificate stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late committed approaches - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric and the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - finds themselves slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," Jol demanded.
My First Time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the Endless Loop, Beer from Liter-Krugs and Celebs in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a television presenter and wears a bespoke dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: Barely three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers rush on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurstäquator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited.
But first arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman makes me aware that I would have tied the apron wrong: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right assigned, widowed in the back."
Secretly I spray myself the loop from back to left.
"Fits," it said, laughing.
Others make less effort around subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked rear against an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a long-winded "ooooo."
This is what he tells me after he has got rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a bin.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics walk in droves across the fairground, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: empty, fully back.
You can't see who's in the Promille coffin under the tarpaulin.
"That's what everyone's packing," one of the paramedics called to me on request, disappearing into the tumult.
After the vote defeat
On Wall Street, fear is on.
Initial news of the bailout's failure caused the Dow Jones to slump by 700 points at times.
That was the biggest point loss within a day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
Around 20:30, the world's most important stock market barometer was listed at a good five percent in the minus at 10,579 counts.
Technology exchange Nasdaq was down 1548 points, down more than seven percent.
The biggest loser at the time was in the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares fell by just under ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken a stake in the company.
Under the rescue plan, the funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid in one fell swoop, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive share warrants from the financial companies, which could be redeemed if the price developed accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Share prices in Europe and USA in downward pull
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the US do not address investors' doubts.
The share price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the Dax down.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the state's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have ripped the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The Munich-based real estate financier's share temporarily lost three-quarters of its value despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6000-point mark, down 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Globally, the stock markets were to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government's $700 billion bailout could not be sufficient to get financial markets going again.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could be on the 1. October follow.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading index Nikkei fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, closing at 12,595.75.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor gave way after announcing a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed for the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be quite right.
For nearly 18 years, the "Ulysses" spacecraft flew through space.
Because of soon-to-freeze fuel lines, you now face cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprising for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the time-honoured law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have identified.
"The responsibility of the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be located very close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously has an attraction, the effect of which on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the scientists’ calculations, dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists deported in Egypt are to be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
Six hostage-takers are said to have been killed in a shooting before the release.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists deported in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking her health condition," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well up and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are said to be already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the official said.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Yom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
name of the accident victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been announced.
Carole Paulson, residing at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of stepfather 'led to suicide'
The years-long abuse by her stepfather has caused a woman to kill herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly handcuffed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle was taking to her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on the 1. killed in April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was living in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who volunteered for the National Trust for much of her time, was prosecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself by a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended this way: "I used to captivate her and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t sexually assault her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
What is worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of what impact, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, has had her act on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June will be charged under the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "They would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be given is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the secure retention of information.
The royal prosecutor's office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published included classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capacity of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing associations face B&B costs
British housing associations could face costs of more than £80 million after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits of 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 building companies
The general director of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited to those 700 financial firms that accept deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to cover some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that every company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that societies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
That said, the companies will have to raise £81 million for first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, the general director of the Association of Housing Associations, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upswing are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were passed in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing associations and their members of potentially significant costs."
Interest due in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates are due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since building societies are bilateral organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in inuring deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks are telling you.
The building sits in a ride at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is disintegrating, for example
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, of which this was the westernmost approach.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late advancer in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further out to what today is Saudi Arabia.
Yet Germany's imperialist projects slammed during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the ornate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely passed from the story.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I have boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the stepstep of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new secular state project to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
The AKP, however, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has provoked some of the suspicion in the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the AKP's main office, a custom-made, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first deals of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a BlackBerry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
These days, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could eventually," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, figuratively speaking, Europe as a whole can travel eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East on the same railway tracks.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt about which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
The people of Jersey are facing having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale market price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is barned
A Bangladeshi court has denied a bail request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defense lawyers said that the court denied bail regarding the indictment to have blackmailed 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although their suspension of detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to remain on the loose when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Upper Court's decision.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not have to be granted bail as she is already on detention suspension abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers object that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to attend after the 17th. October will return home, an Awami alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was jailed last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against themselves.
Fears over Afghanistan's anti-polio initiative
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of employees carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB’s share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BskyB was in doubt about the independence of the ITV, which has prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom communications office have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, particularly because BskyB had announced it was wanting to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutorial affair
The U.S. Attorney General has instructed a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Justice Department's inspector general criticizing the actions of the administration staff.
The report drew criticism from White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears the lawyers had been deposed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now said to be clearing whether officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal action, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that point, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be laid off because of weak work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to consider the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of senior Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of voter fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be deposed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has come under fire for the layoffs and has ultimately resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also quit.
The inspector general's report has in particular critically addressed Gonzales' role by bearing "main responsibility" for the layoffs, "abandoned" his leadership role and shown himself to be "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is scheduled to be honored during the "Q Award" music award ceremony for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize next week in London during the award ceremony, said he was honoured to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awarding, having been shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine magazine Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of those.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts nearly two minutes.
The song has appeared in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached #15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts, selling more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health issues in recent years. One among them was an operation in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngeal inflammation.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in city, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others just comfortable.
Still, it's hard even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repave Extra Place to create a clean drive-through to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it's fascinated by the short alley, simply because it's one of the remains of the block's past.
Yet the city administration department, which is responsible for protecting and building the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the municipal council's land use committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company's purchase of the road.
Still, the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be put forward in the coming month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district executive in the local council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would repave the small street and set up seats designed, among other things, for a cafe to which the company wants to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it did not necessarily own it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this derelict alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's job was to develop rather than manage the real estate.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the East Village's gentrification, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, is to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lawsuits: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published part of the conversation of city history about Extra Place, which was published in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters ".
With a few exceptions, the street has looked just as recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested the road could be somewhat polished up.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual training: Education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch," Bruce Fuller and Lance T discuss. Izumi the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in California studies and senior director in the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign mentions that "the likelihood of successfully completing school among African-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students" - which is true.
To close this performance gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who are learning English first.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which puts the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take, for example, "Sixth Street Prep," an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Still, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
The Sixth Street school puts its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach according to which the training proceeds in an English-speaking environment. That's exactly the point Obama is supposed to keep in mind, according to headmistress Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist lessons.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, you would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and his own consistent support of bilingual training make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English."
Instead, he said, "You are to make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he is supposed to carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil price falls as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of petroleum fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American rescue plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York trading exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been rocked by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked from $145.29 per barrel in July, they have fallen to nearly $90 a barrel this month, then rising again, as a result of the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already expressed concern again, although congressional representatives had announced they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend that should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new worries that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it has apparently failed to revive sentiment in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a note to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading globally, particularly to China.”
The bank's analysts have revised down their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for the price of oil and gas for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Centre-back Shaun Ellis thought he would have seen it all after running up more often than anyone else in the Jets jersey over the past eight-and-a-half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre's pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, that marked the perfect start to an afternoon where her evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one slipping out once as a full-back and the other time 10 seconds before the end of half-time.
"I didn't particularly strain," Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
Our vote was right no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Full-back Darrelle Revis intercepted an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came up with another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss from Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot to the 34 to 0 lead.
Those were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the responses both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time.”
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, having broken his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and become the first person to make the track of 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, thus has his 26. Sets world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track of one kilometer until the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, for fear that in hindsight perhaps exaggerated that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long distance, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously, he came back after a break refreshed and not rusted in.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for orchestrating his races excessively, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders, as if that were a track race, and putting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the great Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers slackened.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff of Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of issues described as a back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She cleverly planned her run by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners tear out, but overtook it after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the excesses of the theme parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first all-black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet sites, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville came to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city it describes is and remains – and which made it a tourist excursion destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the federal writer project at the time of the Depression – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's going to miss."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here continue to be tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very careful how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth a resident of the city and parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 residents, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so really the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced to the world her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Cheeky as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown -white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, although he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever-always-fits-hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," according to 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls immortalized the Hurston, quoting the men singing songs about her beauty, which was full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into town, she mostly did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something to her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always glad to see Zora," Mr Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while rocking in his chair, on a terrace facing to the back, looking out at Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was in all likelihood christened.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no big memorial service in Eatonville, no public readings on a grand scale.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," according to Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main street.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of town.
The proposal was put forward when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"In that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the away-seated people," Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request to force integration by describing its decision in the Brown case against the school board as "insulting rather than respecting my race."
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black kids were used to being embraced - I remember it - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening," according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
That could be sustained so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide there," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who defied prejudice, just as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless tomb and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later was a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. To find Hemenway on the bookshelves, and once again made them a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at exactly a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of publicity.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway animated the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more travelers, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-escore the past.
Eatonville was added to the statewide historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
These days, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from Orlando city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It’s 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of the story of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a permit in advance is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men at field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival was getting bigger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire breed: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and peoples group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police, who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only drive through here will think, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after church.
“But when you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, we are fluent in financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the massive television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even realize they're in the middle of a debacle.
You'd never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror working day every day since the 1929 stock market collapse.
Suppliers are still pushing the metal tea wagons along sidewalks with loud rattles and transporting trays loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos were still shuffling around between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on food stalls on their sidewalks for their breakfast bagel and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided Thursday afternoon to open a new savings account due to all the doomsday talk.
Although I had decided to put my obligatory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase headquarters, there were already about 20 people queuing.
Not at the money counters to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license," stood in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little like a building society), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that have branches only in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of those banks have quietly gone bust.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion investments, went bankrupt into bankruptcy administration and drove home New Yorkers last Friday over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion worth of savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and store employees who were in front of me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have appropriated flowing financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese regular supermarket made reference to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bust and its emaciated-looking chief executive Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block's 50-year-old, has come off our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I’ve changed, I’m not going to take any more risk.”
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was "Death" Handley (obituary on the 11th. September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 were some of us at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of form) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which never subsided for years.
How often did Death stop us to "let the music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never sovereign but never exuberant.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, during which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He loathed conductors who, according to his words, simply "peddled with one or two known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25. September) you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history again at Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book, "Beyond Nab End," but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the wake of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-winger of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take on Thursday, the 17th. January 2008, part of a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is pictured, crossed out with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of grave desecration at a Muslim cemetery in Austria that saw significant gains in the country's parliamentary election the same weekend on which extreme right-wing parties record significant gains in the country's general election.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged in the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an action organized, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal investigators consider this an attempt to obscure the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the news of the grave desecration that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan is drawing to a close.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their election slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the votes, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even made his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which state that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel curfew for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges summed up a six-month suspension after informing the authorities who control him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a foreign travel curfew after she presented evidence to judges of Glitter's criminal record for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Local Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: "On Thursday, the 25. September, the Kent police requested permission at Ashford Local Court to travel abroad by Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until the 25th. prevent March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
As required by the register for sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is located in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after some.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he was returning to the UK.
Last but not least, he arrived on the 22. August at Terminal 3 at Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Local Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for approval to be able to demand that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master backstage to capture his character,' Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who forgo concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artists
On the other hand personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find gesture typical of personality, the depth of a stolen look or express strength of the hands that are worried because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrics of some productions on stage with singer, dancer and guitarist. From this side, he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of flamenco, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is getting bigger and bigger from day to day,' the artist explains, making it clear that `Flamenco-people' `can be any human being, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Completely normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the photo camera.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', set off on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer flamenco understands: `music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Well-known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selections of the nearly seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as a `Portrait of the Veterans of Sport' (`SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me to `I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their life state, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of flamenco of today entitled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can make the exhibition until the 16. Visiting October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is currently writing is `a foolhardy'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel is taking place and what it is about, but, Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he deals with is `a foolishness' and `everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I were calm, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel at some point', so he completed his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days, he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won premium of the Hay Festival and to whom most of those present gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which is composed of `extraordinary adventurousness', from `joy of reading' and from `more to experience', as he writes and `to experience more';these, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what `memory images' it are that form the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic novelist acknowledged that there is `no way' that you measure and how to know whether books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,' Vargas Llosa emphasized, who claims that she `evokes effects' and `to brings people even more apart,' therefore I asked the writers to `take the vocation'.
The weather did not play along at the festival in Pozoblanco: bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters determined that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was subjected to unsettled weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than through his bullfighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, much of the audience responded with booing calls at his second fight.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, whereupon they took the flight.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as announced by the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when officers from the Álava region's traffic police had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the chase until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge strip. At that moment, drivers got out of the car to escape via a country road into a wooded area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to further police departments for accurate laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was `double', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the motor vehicle papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for forgery of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to make the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be brought before the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had watched as she tried to drive out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, reported spokesman for the California traffic police to the magazine `People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear `pressed through the gas pedal after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who at first the actress had probably not realized, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had `fear for Locklears'.
When the police patrol came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the road, thereby blocking traffic.
`She seemed disoriented,' so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the first moment. “According to the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,” the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined, and taken to a local pre-trial detention at around 7pm.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic after undergoing treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left will become in charge of the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the VL's main coordinator and United Left MP, has assured today that the regional education association will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that must assume jurisdiction for it,' Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have towards the one who has so far been a city councillor on the Seville municipal council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for `transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva may have begun: `The VL always insisted that such cases receive the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has `a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to `present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, explained today Carci at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and will later be shown on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of Galdós literature, assures that thanks to this filming, his `childhood dream' has come true. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid, a commemorative film for the second celebration of the century on the 2nd. Shooting November in Madrid. Mainly because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales', it accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, made for filming by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci offers, as he added, the `one-off possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of the `confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been put into question by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that you could not expect the financing as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in `Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you first have to rehearse before you start shooting and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared to be `humiliating' and giving respect, `part of the profession of film director is to provide help in the theater and the cinema.
Many of the performers he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar candidate in four nominations (one of which he has won), is of the opinion, assuring that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“In the beginning, you believe that you work for the offspring, later you realize that it’s just for flourishing, and now you’re content if you’ve produced another film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
`We try not to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance basics helped me a lot in flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm," she asserts.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her ex-pupils.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I'm very honored.'
The production also anticipates musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he `takes on the role of the companion again and again.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she has usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works no longer have any more and therefore appreciate them even less,” Bayón asserts.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, how they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
Thus, `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May, and which was now opened in May andCongress is presented.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The US can't imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in `Sensational Reporter', and from the then dominant idea of US cinema, which was abandoned, from all of America to Newman with his thrilling performance and followed her.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
and when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big blow to everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” Robert Redford said, crying, ‘my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.’
No one was afraid to ridicule themselves or to exaggerate themselves.
As the `father' of cinema and the fatherland, he has died at a sad moment in which there is fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the downcast self-esteem of Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue few people you can admire remain, you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses both profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country, where it took him a lot of effort to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement strikes house-high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one human has died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`The greatest of us has left us all,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who dare to live today as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high demands on righteousness, leading a responsible private life far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years afterwards, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on Earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none he was as proud of those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and those of the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016 after all.
But I wonder, `Are we prepared for that?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is not true!
She was called a perfect road, and in my opinion, she was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, something like that would clearly not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket-getting, which allows you to leave first.
It doesn't seem to be bad to me either, but if they're already letting you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
So, don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only because of it) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little something compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to bring it back.
In addition, it looked to be waiting for rain in these 40 minutes, so that it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and to raid the cottage.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the exit has been stamped out incorrectly.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never come to mind.
So I think we'll be dreaming for a long time about a city that's well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft has introduced the advancement of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is, however, capable of completing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move around the company's campus). The system pays attention to what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and facial recognition system, this `receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present into the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that is having conversations with her, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better stuff to focus on, for example, on the next version of their operating system Windows.
This week was very superficial about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the essentials, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that's only going to be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or the other function and `extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to competing with Windows.
Many people cleverly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of your ‘death’, not as an absolute but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the surroundings of the `windows'.
What is half of the computer of existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I'm bringing a little example of that.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google used for research on the net.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be published in the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the ability to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the core at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso did it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless star performances, we can draw back on the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted up heavyweights in a travelling circus.
Basically, that's a typically male cotton T-shirt, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it `tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called `Marcel' in a narrow circle. Legend has it that the name formation is associated with sport and comes from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' towers over everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinguishing unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which have these T-shirts as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not just focused on the production of `tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a great pity to use it as underwear.
They are very attractive.
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this wide-body sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical subtleties, which allow even more comfortable driving and gasoline saving.
changes before the imminent revolution.
Thus is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale in the other markets.
That's a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also later this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Even so, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars. This is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002. That's 6.7% of the total sale at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models a year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to finish the year with a total sale of 22 000 models. This is 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new room flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the backdoors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second generation engines of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp with 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - Jazz's predecessor reached 78 horsepower - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In view of the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the former generation, it now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great demeanor with her sister, did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is dainty, but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who maintain their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moves there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentino’s honors.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women as they are clothed, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything meets in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around in my aunt's clothes cabinets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real actor role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
You turned 30 recently, have you not fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was a little kid and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking of becoming a mother, isn't it?
For a long time I have known that I am becoming a mother, because my body demands this and besides, I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried about that.
I will, give my child great feelings of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for film art, you keep in mind the work you participated in and that was shot last year.
This is exactly how it is and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, is that right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for her organization's charity 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two items of clothing from our collection have been auctioned for Mango to raise the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are a lot of things being told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Still, I will support this good cause that she's involved in.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this big-hearted thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support the women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
`Car bee' that avoids collisions
To drive the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is due to the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, this allows you to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for avoiding the collision
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90o or even greater angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not so, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,’ explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory of Mobility and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, but also not over-corner; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
`This device only needs to process the information every one few seconds and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers to store, so it can continuously work with only a few dozens of KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of the technologies for the immediate prevention of the collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce to the production cars over the next decade.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the destination while driving, avoiding the obstacles along the way.
The motorists who may relapse because of the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installs in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunken state. If he's alcoholic, the car won't start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the attorney general. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he is given a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Prosecutor General’s Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who have been reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol, put themselves back at the wheel.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart if the driver has taken alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the USA in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be realized in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still not available in any store on the Spanish markets, even though it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party’s initiative, which proposes to install this system on school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias were travelling.
The sun went down, but their rays have still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting off the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of the day you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Navy soldiers who give up honorary salvo.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', perhaps she has been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they will be housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to make jokes.
She's shaking before she's charged with a mortgage.
One has to realize that the Treasury Department of the United States, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid U.S. citizens getting involved in mortgage stories of the allegedly solvent banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the `hotel of bad credits' or of the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and specifically its receptionist, is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it is the moment not to ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamlike room appears at the hotel.
at least something, because it's not about buying a better house
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to showcase a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship in the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, tears himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and worn some jewelry from ELAH that was stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended together with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they have loaned them to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has rushed to the shop and had pants and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we could rejoice in the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed varnishes and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars beneath the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget about chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, all are collected in a book in which it says how to come to relaxation. The book arrives at the bookstores on 30. September.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21. century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to shut down from the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book presents the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or suggest the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be terrified, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking during sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (each day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this appearance.
Often, connections with other appearances in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panicky anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bed-wetting at night), speaking in sleep sought, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak calmly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (cries, crying, long discussions ).
In cases when the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check whether there is a problem, what causes anxiety and comes about in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with the stress).
What you can do is do a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to arouse the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are horrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep soundly.
Once speaking occurs during sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Though the child is speaking, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it is frightened by a couple of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what reason the child has for the fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so ordinary), the child does not put pressure on him to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you’ll hear what it says, but you won’t know what it’s dreaming and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you hear that at night and know its secrets.
Not even a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's not a bad thing, this is a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhäuser ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäuser is finally back on course for success on the pitch.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks earned numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of that encounter, where the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot passed narrowly at the angle, Illhäuser was supposed to dominate the game with ease, and it was alternately managed to challenge Denmark's defence with a long-range shot, then brain with a high-pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of his foot.
The opposing team blocked in the centre of the field, letting only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with first two goal chances won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood just right to take on a ball again, which had been fended off by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the Illhausian scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, whereby his teammates had to continue playing inferior numbers.
Denmark, however, did not know how to exploit this and did not face any major problems for an ill-house elf, who retreated just a little to 'condense' their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the bar after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to arrive Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him `with a constructive spirit', and hope that he will come with `concrete proposals'.
The president's visit will take place at the same time as a general assembly of the crisis committee, set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the diesel price, which has reached a record high of over 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the press secretary of the Elysée Palace David Martinon `, the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the workplace conditions and the pay of sailors'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in the Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as: Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the responses to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
`The strike will continue,' because `the fishermen will not give in on any point' and `do not want to go to Paris,' announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently costs about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the aftermath of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes said goodbye to the movie legend and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects this year with 215 aircraft delivered, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is complying with its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reiterated its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes for much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times' Sunday edition, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that has been stretched ahead of it.
AIG is willing to target the sale of much of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement savings in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday night to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be achieved at the AIG.
Assets that AIG would potentially separate from include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make the sales to repay the loans over 85 billion that the federal reserve has granted it, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is down 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) was previously on the 17th. September 2001 was recorded, day of trade decline after the terrorist attacks of 11. September.
According to the final firing figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was again intended to allow some stability in the markets, collapsed Wall Street, which had already been slapped at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 for it, MPs denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is where a bad picture is being circulated that portrays Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will come `too late'.
“If the project is indeed doomed (...), it quickly becomes the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, d. Red.) and other central banks are getting to grips with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more," warned Brian Bethune, head of economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, highlighting the feeling of utmost urgency even more, “that every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial company” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy the banking of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets are facing `not only an American crisis but a worldwide crisis', the analyst added to the FTN Financial.
The market for basic consumer goods has grown strongly.
The state treasury's revenues within ten years have declined Friday night from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Morgan Stanley to provide her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of three billion dollars.
The assumed price is below 19% of the price value of the stock of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be sold again at a cost of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be made on the basis of a single average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, fell 6.79% to $23.07 against 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is supposed to allow it to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the federal reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
`A week ago,' declared in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, `we thought the stake would be entirely common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge. ''
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price value for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press secretary refused to provide more precise information on the two new allies' strategic plans.
Following MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had lowered its record 'significantly' since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch its stock market price decline by half, while the price of insurance against default skyrocketed.
That price declined on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other `survivor' of the major investment banks on Wall Street following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrew $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st. re-establishing century around.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third party who this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan of a new constitution up for election.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results amounting to 80% of the electoral votes, 64% voted `Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted `No', 7% of the ballot papers were invalid and 0.7% were delivered empty.
For the constitutional project to be passed, one vote must be scored more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a counting of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `Yes', predicting him 63% to 70%.
By the way, on the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The `Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,' he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held silently according to the observational delegation of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure the `new socialism' for which the President advocates.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to `development planning' in a country that largely lives from oil production by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange that sends emigrants to the country.
The project, which will be advanced by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also safeguards the principle of free medical care and schooling, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner after points in first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel, which was to be followed by a third of American families, for the election of both Republicans and Democrats.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, though quite handsome, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, i.e. those that matter now, Obama emerged as the winner from the polls with 39%, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop to bring his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, and in doing so clearly underlining the `naivety' of his opponent regarding these questions, which formed the focus of this first televised duel.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being out of touch.
He brought to the fore his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
`McCain still hasn’t understood, Obama, on the other hand,’ said, this weekend, a Democratic campaign commercial against it, in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full scale of the crisis that weighs on the ‘American off the street’.
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words `Mittelstand' or `Workers'. The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans think is most appropriate to save the economy even on the verge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The coming week could be a decisive turning point,' said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is the final verdict of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.
After re-emphasizing that he would probably even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully evaded the questions that turned to the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (€470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Youth and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday night since polling stations closed in Minsk's marketplace to protest the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: `The dictator is to resign'.
Some admit that they have not even chosen: `What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including not issuing visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the ice-up of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed to be clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
`We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,' regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, points out Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive branch.
When MPs of the opposition move into parliament, it's because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean airtime on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. ''
The opposition therefore owes it to itself to interfere in the political game, because `the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that the turnout figures appear too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place?, asks the leader of Social Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most likely to conform to the government's ideas. ''
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate each other on their success.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon in a healthy and unscathed manner.
By the morning, they had been freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Seemingly in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to Cairo's international airport at around 15.30 on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigners' district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy `best health' and the kidnappers `have not been paid a ransom'," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna declared on the runway.
After they on the 19th. September in an SUV safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya had been captured, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Egypt, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official explained that 30 members of the special forces, from on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
`On both sides, shots were fired and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this person in charge, who wishes to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
`We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the Secret Service and from the Special Forces,' he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle during a patrol, in which the kidnappers were located, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on funding the culture is making headlines and is central topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pathetic sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that are starving to death miserably?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors write in their country’s constitution that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all administrative districts, in mutual coordination.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec's History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 history societies strive to deal intensively with history, save a few dines the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers to our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Talk - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th yesterday. anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most importantly, she has regained the public's trust, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross' blood donation service were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry led by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to deliver his report, at the time several provinces set up a committee whose aim was to develop a new system for managing canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood preserves and by working in this field during the following years, we have regained the trust of the public,' she says,' she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. However, Décary maintains in the awareness that `trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on 28. September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new species of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since its foundation in 1998.
And we had not the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted via the blood.
So we invoked one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which one applies exclusion measures if one does not know this and when a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is manifested by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proved without any doubt that this disease is transmitted via the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market for detecting HIV: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibody to the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was substantially reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, that means you would have to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood preserve.
I believe that nowadays you can feel comfortable when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's director.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, just like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects via the blood.
We need to continuously monitor,' Dr. Décary away before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a safe supply.
`The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because the treatments to fight cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population is also affecting the blood donor network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebec residents suitable for blood donation. ''
Any healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is spread will be excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With this 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies canned blood, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was formerly considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' explains Dr. Décary further, which describes this program of umbilical cord blood collection as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it,' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Sounders from Seattle at the second and decide game of the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the elimination games of the first league of the USL.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of play.
After a first-half without a goal for both one side and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to get in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that at the first game of the pre- and return-game series on Friday Impact had earned the Starfire Complex in Tukwila a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semifinals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday night Thunder was able to equalize a 3 to 1 deficit in the return leg in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps moved into the semifinals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Victory Gate by Kovalev
The Canadian team's No. 1 trio is ready to tackle the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Florida Panthers with a stormfire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec provided two templates and Kovalev converted a pass in that winning game, the Tricolore's fourth in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the win by scoring the only goal of the whole shooting.
“I’m not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. ''
`He was too fixated on that in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. ''
Charest bets on the North
The prime minister does not rule out running elections before the end of the year.
Once the Liberal Party's General Assembly ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
“Delaying the course of our last major border in the north”: this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal Quebec Party in Levis, following the guidelines entirely.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
big means like during the election period.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he announced that his schedule was very full.
The ‘Plan North’ is the fourth element of a ‘vision’ allegedly for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic area’ that provides for an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and settlements with Ontario.
Though frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was `a jewel with enormous potential', but did not name a date, investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some outlook at what could be more worked on: especially on water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charest’s list, the North has `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice the size of France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us," he stressed, as if to clearly show that he is looking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the North, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It's ours, it's our future,' he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec area, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister told the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a boundary line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity presents itself, I will take that stance again on behalf of the government," he explained.
In addition, `with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,' he explained, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round because of the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister thinks that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the indigenous people and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would handle them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP of Ungava) have already initiated deliberations at about thirty communities.
A committee of ministers headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, `not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where `one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan North will be `discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this `vision' as if it were a continuation of those of the Liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This, by the way, was one of the weekend's repeatedly raised themes, that on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th. Anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage was opened.
One of the adopted decisions is to rename the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who has achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Jean Charest explained.
To the press, he referred to a different, this time conservative, project, namely the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest emphasizes that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
`That remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which provoked in those applause storms.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out an election that is possible for him by law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, largely because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, above all from `the Constitution' goals, which were readily adopted: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and for them to veto the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan North were taken up with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has brought back the policy on the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, the Liberal government refrained from applying it.
If she had, `we would be much further' today," said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the government's adoption of a plan North.
`But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big notion,' explained party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Land
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (what irony) in the Harper cabinet, it was what allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'disgrace' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with reproach, says just as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned that has not brought home its countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things he was accused of happening.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate in inhumane conditions.
The only one who condescends to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a just trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that is also closing its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to the fact that a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever after so many years of torment.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently witnessing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he after the 14th. October belong entirely to the minority...).
Many voters believe they find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they don't see this government renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17. September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director General of Canada's Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms, and in doing so pursues an Orwellian logic that the world’s largest gold-producing society sought a defamation lawsuit for six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to drive anyone into ruin who dares to take one of their opposite opinion.
No matter how the trial ends, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid for from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Moreover, the tactic in these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the other side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast, what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually played out through the exchange of ideas rather than through club blows.
So it would have sufficed if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and brushes aside the petitions and letters in support of Noir Canada's authors with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can simultaneously ask for a `public' debate and, in doing so, disregard the opinions of this very public?
Seemingly, in the world of the Vice President, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the gold mine's brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag lawsuit (in the course of the `public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them to stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and truth-finding, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could have it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to get to grips with debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it pretends, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, just as it is for public debate, and it is time for governments to take action that restricts this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis, which has been rocking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main contents are: better control of MPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds employed, new injunctions to curb the number of houses pledged on the basis of arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior staff of the supported companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican Representative, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-driven,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“It was all to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t, the trauma, chaos and unrest in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” explained Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who did not participate in the negotiations until late showed themselves to be supporters of the settlement rather than, however, without failing to express their discontent that they had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain injunctions to settle, especially those that are intended to allow owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of senior executives of the state-bailed companies.
`If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on American television stations.
When asked on another broadcaster if he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I'd like to know the specifics first, but I hope so.
`The guiding principles I have read [show] that this is one thing we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is quite simply not acceptable,' he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared toward taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more common bonds (PCAA), and eventually leading to a freeze in financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who let the first attempt to reach a settlement fail last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of societies in distress are only to be secured by the government and not bought, one believes escape the impasse.
To round off the perspectives for everyone in Congress, an injunction has also been added that, if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to regain its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be passed in a renewed vote by Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies that will earn him dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again if the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the attachment procedures concerning the housing that are tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and will also set deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him as early as today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more votes rose yesterday against this project, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
`Quite obviously, Washington doesn't understand us,' Republican Scott Garett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, explained to his constituents.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that involves asking taxpayers to cash in.'
Democratic lawmaker Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Kaukus of skeptics', puts things differently but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured, and to carefully consider what way to take,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe once again received proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis caused by the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos declared yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value, now that uncertain times are announcing themselves. ''
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalising another bank brought into trouble by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to nationalise the UK government since the start of this financial crisis, after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the aftermath of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in it was reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made-man, the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War in the battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early 50s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before succeeding at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This very man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who finished second in the 1979 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a flagship relationship.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive to the glamour of show business disappear, whose puzzles will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put cinema lovers in wobble this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change passes with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is remembered again, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot tin roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter-date memory (1990) is evoked by his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans over the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, which Newman made properly known in 1956.
This likeable gangster in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth know him especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, revealing Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his all-too-expressive performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time only so.
However, he was less likely to play Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, nastys or desperate, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slip-off and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honors poured over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gun companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely, “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of drifting Hollywood, is now also going there.
We probably often saw him standing with our foot in bowls full of vinaigrettes, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his turnovers nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman got involved until the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: `Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. ''
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & Co.?
On the 8. October begins negotiations in the criminal case against Jáno's contract and his accomplices.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, grossly negligent injury and business fraud, and other criminal offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the funds lucrated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often subject to forged invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to have flowed partly into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the clubs were also said to have failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, a majority of the bills are said to have been forged.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market by Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by Jáno's surcharge.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded invoices for the consumptions in order to later be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These accounts are said to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, the latter, according to our information, having been responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the restaurant is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the boss of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious formal and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, according to the bill, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the forgers of accounts were apparently set with no limits when it came to the Pigal Kft., a restaurant in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according to the prosecution do not even appear.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that these were forged documents when documents were submitted to him by the public prosecutor during a questioning.
“Our company name and tax number were incorrectly attached to the stamp.”
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that impossible offer space for so many people was also wrong.
Food had also been cited on the invoice, but the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The busy invoice forgers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they have targeted exclusively offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary trips on the cash payment bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As it became known in the course of the investigation, they have also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company charges only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "invoicers" was that they had indicated "goods transport" as a service rendered in a case, although this is not offered by the company specialising in investment advice, the prosecutor's office said.
Other formal errors - incorrect invoice format, wrong stamp - was due to the fact that the one at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Bizto's Pont invoices issued could be exposed as fakes.
Likewise in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors asserted that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is said to have eaten there - the mass administrator consequently stated that he had not issued the bills themselves.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to put in fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious bills.
Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with surcharge and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörsfenyő Egyesület with forged invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million, which referred to services not provided.
However, there was also no payment transactions, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which those affected have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company that cannot be found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of HUF about 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the since the 14. Cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which is in liquidation in liquidation, acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigations to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalents themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers at Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was tasked with preparing the company foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the clubs associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices with a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The public prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case, the bills were enclosed with Biztos Pont's applications.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have used these amounts in a purpose-deprived manner.
To cover up this, they have submitted five fictitious invoices from the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
These invoices, by the way, were secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess the procedure of forgery of the invoice, as they have already been filed before the public prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main defendant, Jáno's surcharge, decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the redress of the majority of the damage incurred by HUF 50 million, and whether the contract is prepared in return to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that Zuschlag now plays the "insulted" after his requests had met with mitigation of imprisonment and house arrest on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater harm with economic offences and have not remunerated them are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, surcharge is denied this possibility.
The psychology of outbidding - or why we're willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue what is offered.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the Science magazine, people do not want to be defeated in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play the lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, in which the overbidding of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted studies on the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, after which they made their stakes.
Another group was also promised $15 rewards in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a losing match.
So the difference between the two groups was merely that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing "against losing" were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or the "profit" group.
“These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, these have so far only justified the behaviours observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York's economics faculty.
Hepatitis: When to visit the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, however, the pathogens and the diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travelers are recommended a vaccination against the viruses A and B anyway, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A show up about two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and the recovery can last for up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million dies annually. People on the far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis, triggered by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that only one in ten infected people is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this condition is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of people suffering from chronic hepatitis C is estimated at 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Detected in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which eliminates the risk of infection and prevents the development of cancer.
The 30. September is the World Hepatitis Day, hosted for the first time by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this virus-induced chronic liver inflammation, its emergence and the importance of early detection.
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed the European Commission's competition authority over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis, which has already been going on for a year, so decisions now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will presumably sell part of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities bought by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep decline last week, in the second half of the week already serious crisis scenarios emerged.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bust.
The institute's securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion American bailout and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the downturn of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new director general.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there has been no prospect with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, meanwhile, was striving for reassurance - no investor is said to be shaking for his money, it said.
So far, no panic has broken out among customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows that religious faith acts like a kind of "painkiller" that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent faith in God influences the sensation of pain of man, the British newspaper "Telegraph" reported.
In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, believers were able to take out the bulk of the pain.
Using a brain-scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains that are responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand of the subjects, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th. century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermeline."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would evoke a kind of religious trance while selecting da Vinci's painting because it was little different from the other painting and was perceived as reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were to look at either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "safe" as if they were "cared for," and they felt "rest and peace."
While looking at the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused by other, strong-acting images in the atheists, one would only have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising the faith should change our personality, and in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question left is what effect a Madonna picture of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of her 10th birthday, Google can rightly claim that it can be found in people’s pockets just as it is above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialist doctors they are going to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
Towards skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets align: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal, according to which it wants to “arrange all the information in this world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google was able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do so, because they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later resort to it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data misuse - "If you look up what I'm doing" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more of the potential power represented by the company that seems terrifying, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power that is met with rejection by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the crackdown on paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google handed over information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also allowed an identification of the paedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google successfully went to court together with the civil rights organization EFF against the FBI: therefore, Google can not be forced in the future with any point of the Constitution to give information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but the list of individual users or their web and search term list was retroactively withheld from it to two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who do not like to give out their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using the Google services, scourge the company with the indignation due to the conservative-presenting companies.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture," which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes to its users, and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the software giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that has become the focus, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e., the users intentionally leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average young person can manage his profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it by means of other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are gosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases proves: When looking at the party photos of the past night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is fired, because he in his blog all too honestly his anger about the company management - one thing is certain: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads an online life, is what he reveals of himself - so one could roughly formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And if you try to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, you can do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Quite a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, meanwhile, is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly faster services are causing headaches not only for Microsoft, but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing opposite poles: For example, the Group Executive Board has completely rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten have been doubled, and the management also said that the repeated food of the employees was too expensive. However, all this seems almost mildly against the fact that in 2006, Google even fell to its knees before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all hits critical of the regime, or those that violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could change a lot again: While some think Google's book and magazine scan and magazine scans and magazines. Archiving project is now taking on the extent that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, so others are rather worried about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi authors with the subject matter - for example, "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, in the best Orwellian manner, describes a future in which a human becomes terrifyingly approachable thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two youths, who are suspected to have helped in the removal of the tracks, the spokesman for the police commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were confessed, they are currently being charged with aid.
According to the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on the loose.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having intentionally murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the wake of the investigation, it has emerged that the 23-year-old had owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Announces Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million Euro, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the one hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolevski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer the Poles had laid out despite the fact that they were earlier excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far laid offers.
Petr Koblic, chief executive of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would arguably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that that could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion Crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments, which were devoted to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke on Tuesday of the "second 11. September."
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate, from a "second 11. September" to speak.
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo," the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, the danger threat that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer disregard the threat, says the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
Some states could still provide rescue packages to their slinked financial institutions, and rescue the banks with taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bust, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Vienna-based "Der Standard" recalls. In addition, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to reach a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping like a tsunami over the old continent.
The "saviors" would not have to "wail" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to hold on, in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in the creation of new accidents of avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system, controlled by car robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "protective shield," Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To imitate the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it weren't, the car robot wouldn't be able to respond quickly enough to dodge the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently still considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the avoidance, unlike the bees, cannot be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While the bees have an infinite number of possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotary movement, or acceleration and braking, in the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than traditional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less about processing the data, and even less about the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react to them accordingly.
It does not have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes up only a handful of KB memory.
It doesn't require gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be standard in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the sin-expensive child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bailout law is available, which will be applied in several stages and is aimed at the purchase of the banks' bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money is to be spent.
In a session that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, congressmen have reached out to an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after several days of debates, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president in the American House of Representatives, saying that the agreement only had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: The program will have an effect and it will be efficient, but you have to do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about taking the helm of the economy around.
The written version of the package was released even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then it's the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
However, the program differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, according to which the 700 billion. Dollars at once for the purchase of rotten securities burdened with loans should be issued.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-bearing, bad securities, and over the additional 100 billion. USD is to be decided by the President.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700bn depends on another decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Treasury can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-burdened securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the expected damages corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to 700 billion. Dollars can be provided as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or avoiding a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it is signed, according to Paulson.
However, the bosses of the banks, which are in trouble and now dependent on state aid, can expect that their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang, will be cut by the government.
A cut in salaries will only exist in certain cases, and those cuts will depend on how the Treasury Department helps out in each case.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, so the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the disused banking chief is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that managerial salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements so that more people participate in the program.
That's the first case in American history that cuts in managerial salaries are settled by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk to the taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank is better off.
The bill stipulates that the president must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there have been skeptics on both sides who have expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise
Like the Central Bureau of Statistics, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008, and are down 3.9% from the previous year's prices.
Due to domestic price changes and the export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic selling prices are only slightly, i.e. by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Manufacturing industry's selling prices also rose little - 0.1 percent -- since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes the prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove up prices in chemicals and productions considerably (1.6 percent).
A price decline was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and slightly in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in paper production, as well as at the publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the one on the 1st. July introduced price increase in gas.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase was 11 percent in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The magnitude of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed 10.2 percent last year.
Electricity, gas, steam and water prices rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in the fixed assets sector in August.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices went up 0.3 percent, while they have remained the same in the energy and processing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector compared to the comparable period of 2007 (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, while a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted for fixed assets.
Industry export prices measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency became 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it became 7.5 percent stronger compared to the euro, and even 15.9 percent stronger in the dollar.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the American-Hungarian visa agreement will be reached around the 12th. January will come into force, as the Foreign Minister explained in front of the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "it all depends now only on whether the electronic immigration or control system overseas is introduced in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is in negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she is also holding talks with the foreign policy advisers to Democrats Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain back bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, on Sunday have their support for the 700bn. Dollar heavy bailout for banks pledged. However, there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and representatives of the government have announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have come to an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central questions of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s high, which has given him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would rule the law over the $700bn. Dollar heavy package will quickly accept.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that it has supported.
“We must act now, and responsibly (...) - Your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain's economic visions as "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: “We will all have a hard time pinching on that, but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Treasury secretary, as well as restricting clearances for top executives - something he has insisted on.
To the CBS, Obama told McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking countries
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break of the era is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, already became apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
Because already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU lands at 47.7 percent and thus fell below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s
That was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, i.e. still in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization, which is consistently operated by the CSU in the federal state, has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already forecast this 40 years ago, but estimated themselves at a rate. But without any impact, the secularization, the educational successes, the influction of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by option multiplication. And that has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks the classic citizen groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma such as a university degree.
Here, the CSU's support dropped to even below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders cautiously on coalition issues" titled article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ would like to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely let it look into their cards.
SPÖ chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, voters would have voted out the bowl-molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
Molterer, meanwhile, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which will be hosted this year by the EU Presidency country France.
In her speech addressed to the House, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to the education segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the right that Roma children are experiencing, and this was also the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Affairs Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civic organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the MEPs of the Fidesz reports, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the job search, the Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
“The vast majority of Roma youths do not have middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree.”
Járóka also emphasized that education is a fundamental human right that would play a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU member states.
In the view of the MEPs, it is important that these connections become aware of the broadest possible circle - i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
Because the sooner a Roma pupil starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and sales tax they make their contribution to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated teaching must be discontinued," said Lívia Járóka.
As the MEP explained, a common, goal- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of disegregation in the education sector. To this end, correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-entitled citizens," Járóka urged.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancing of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
Fox in the chicken coop
Due to a person’s medication consumption, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees and the withdrawal amounts in the event of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and if the risk is estimated too high, the insurance is not taken out in the first place.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the investigation results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far more favorable method: Based on the identification number of the customer, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e. which preparations were bought, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers from and what his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it would be possible to conclude that his blood lipid levels are untreatably high, which would automatically rank him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while those mentioned before that are not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, own companies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and connect them to the data on drug use. In this way, they provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is becoming more difficult.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing firms.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject can hardly prohibit access to his data, otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to the grace of the fox.
CSU: Mercy on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party congress.
However, the much-scolded duo already made it clear that they do not want to stick on their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the disgruntled faction and the party base, which called for personal consequences a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at his career's highlight - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
The CSU was "alone-governor" in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
The conservatives remain the defining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal party restructuring, the potential successor Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the reconnaissance team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list "Free Voters" that Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, and then mercilessly dump the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called the 28. September the "most bitter day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his view, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, not be put back on its feet with a joint effort, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the CSU's loss of terrain will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition lawmaker made it into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposing party, which was gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "allow" some members of the opposition in parliament this time.
That's why the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia thanks to rising prices in natural gas imports. Loans have even been taken out to alleviate the price increases, and the country has also agreed to the divestment of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. So in the background of the opposition's expectations, there was the hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians have a ban on entry in the EU because of the political system classified as anti-democratic.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was more on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections - caused a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday - so opposition activists should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to let even one opposition activist into parliament."
The opposition is not planning protest measures in the face of the results, but rather tries to make the need for economic reform clear to voters.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in the distribution, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the elderly," said Milinkevich, in reference to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" admonishing the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," according to Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe the deeds, and not the words." The lack of the opposition is therefore a testament to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners on both sides, this was the main issue alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic major power that should be given more voices and participation in international concerns, the member states have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth Marseille summit yesterday.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and chief diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement has been reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion. Euros should be increased.
Given that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India have also been legally combined into an agreement, so that in the future also air transport will be boosted.
By 2009, India intends to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one partner of India, New Delhi ranks only ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to the global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or the terrorism, which the two sides condemned in the strongest possible terms. The convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions are to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Food price rises should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided on for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be at the 60. Book fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights, be present.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread out over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, digits, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but especially in the adult and youth division.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
Starting today, the measure will come into force against those smart eggs who first stamp and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Slacking Law" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
""Rotatable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers ends.
Masi says: "the choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by everyone, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Higher Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
from Rome, the minister announces that "within three months, the absences of civil servants have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people a year are present at work."
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
“Their wage dynamics – according to the minister – have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to counter the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles himself with figures on lower absences at work - so writes the consumer center - the people of 'active slackers' grows continuously.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable civil service officials have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree.
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are also contested.
Napolitano: 'Prevention against workplace accidents is crucial'
Every day in Italy, 2500 accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain invalids for life.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These digits prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as are caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of workplace accidents in all provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in jobs, to the protection of injured workers, to the aid to the families of the victims and to raising awareness of public opinion."
"An indignant "Basta" has risen up on this; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, trigger some swirl in the media and sympathy of the public. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case there is also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school frameworks on the part of the young people who are feeding on the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness. You have to put into effect and improve a legislative standard.
For his part, the president of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decided rules that have the goal of putting an end to the problem."
"The data on workplace accidents appear to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the possibility that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," said President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘positive tendency’ to mean less attention. This is what causes tragedy in the end.”
“As you believe, there is basically too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger checks and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting out in school.
“A further effort is necessary – he adds – in terms of communication and raising public opinion awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in demand towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency.”
Mercandelli also came to speak of "the progressive deterioration of protection for the accident victims" and denounced the "abolition of the social system, which we have been fighting against in recent years".
“The goal is therefore to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not become dependent on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided by a legislator from time to time.”
Mp3 player under indictment: Risk of hearing damage
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as B. Mp3 player, listening to, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report circulated today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csseri (Scientific Committee on the Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
“The report said in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for longer than an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing.”
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and cell phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings – so it is said on the part of the Eu – a clear risk is shown, which pushes for fast action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and turn this information into common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we must re-examine the existing control systems so that they are completely effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
The scientists, the EU Communication concludes, confirm that it is rightly concerned and that the Eu Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music equipment and similar devices.
At the moment, a European standard already exists that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise pollution.
You can very much narrow down this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the Euu points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud (louder than 89 decibels) loudly (louder than 89 decibels), so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross music this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore amount to 5-10% of users of devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno gives the go-ahead for the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it should be over, in June it will take stock.
This is the procedure set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome". The commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the leadership lines for Rome.
Once the project will be completed, the city and local councils will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno points out. “She will offer proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city and local council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be finished and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a timed end point.
In June, the Lord Mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission.
Anyone who questions the competence of the Commission, since their opinion is lacking in commitment, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France the Attali Commission, it delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to keep an eye on a longer period of time, so that with serious work in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city.
The Lord Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think. It will employ the best minds in the capital.”
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, in order to enable our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself in the current municipal borders, but will look much further," not only with regard to the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician who cares a lot about being considered independent has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and who maintained relations with enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private citizen).
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami has written on an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, however, these attacks do not have much to say; these are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls, too; everyone says Obama will win by a big lead.
In this case, too, there are people who talk to the heart and not the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its in the editorial: only in the polling booth will we well know who the real American patriot will give his vote to.
This is where a US mentality comes to light, which has been kept hidden to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll decide who we’re going to make our sneering for, for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were interviewed: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% have responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 troops in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 troops lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Still, Iraq remains Bush's weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place faces a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the information on competent parties because of the general credibility.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
It is a problem that must be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press are of the opinion that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even about 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are feeling has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to joining the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good for journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national-level editors are sure, their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
The plant managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
Journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a topical issue in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists are under contract.
In a vast nation, as the U.S. is, with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as they please and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief very often get very high wages, the editor, on the other hand, can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 vacation days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, frequently become "sick" over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's request. He had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is being investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the event of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence requirement in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the public prosecutor had spoken out against) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence indicting him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's $700 billion austerity package: A large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the running step divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to those in Washington and the financial world, and who, above all, win voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise, above all, to the voice of what I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already representing: not only in the USA, but also in the entire West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by them.
In both the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage a tremendous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which also represent an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have become sidelined in itself and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, because of its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all. Distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the USA has been in the economic situation to save itself without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that cannot be overvalued – in certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to fall back in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked empire, into a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we must suddenly realize how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although these can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are nevertheless connected to the utmost with a narrowly circumscribed piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such territory, to another living in a ready-earner, waterless or oil depositary area, is in advantage.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short insertion.
Who says territory, who government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis appears to be creating two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of economics, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerantness, a picture of inexpediency, a sense of distance, all of which are directed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content presents itself to the majority as increasingly foreign and more traditional.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branching but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the sudden shift of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in terms of what is going on in the lower social classes of the West today and is reinforced by the financial crisis and driven to the point of oversizedness.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
However, keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now seemingly almost at its destination.
With an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 sqm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – has an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be thought of like a series of tubes arranged to a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests, carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding ability of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "can be easily removed from the wall," according to Liming Dai, researcher from the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
WALKING ALONG WALLS? "This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Like Spiderman on walls, like Spiderman? Perhaps already, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall within the field of space travel.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER KIND OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibres that cleanse itself from dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, especially in the summer, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time with certain vital medications, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. Within the framework of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to such an extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus the health of the patients is endangered.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs, such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS IN JEOPY – The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mix, and emphasizes to pay attention to what is drunk in conjunction with agents such as diazepane or metadone.
It’s not just GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11. In September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial in the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the US than the assassinations.
A prediction that received quite a few polemics in response and was still held before the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public field of view," Krugman explained in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some novelties to the audience: in addition to a revised and now more spartanly designed initial menu, now a guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is finally achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which e.g. B. it is easier to send via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multi-handed by different users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a request to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently in the process of publishing various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if the freedom to cost can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, various public administration and schools institutions have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program, which aims to suppress Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the better-known access; and lastly, a graphics module.
The objective for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up with the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who as third-class and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to test positive for Cera, the third-generation epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those made by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories in recent weeks.
If the counter-samplings now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed onto the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy, "the former country of émigrés, has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only received with reluctance.
Do this out of the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what The New York Times asks in a lengthy article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and from the fall of the young, Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times describes as the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "most integration and job opportunities exist," yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is to be recorded."
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times invokes further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just that.
The new Lega-launched legislation against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane, which disappeared a year ago, recovered
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, the one on the 3. September 2007 on a flight over the Nevada desert billionaire, was found.
The individual parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson completely invalidated the final doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, whereupon a force was sent out. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance.”
Mr. Anderson also further confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The American Office of Road Safety (Ntsb) indicated that a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a crew was sent out, which identified the machine on it: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was on the 3rd. September 2007 was lost after Fossett took off for a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal items from a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes were also found in California, not far from the Nevada border.
These are two ID cards named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to get around the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover with an airplane.
Among his several records is a high-altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andeans, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you're not expecting
A suv that falls from the traditional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
It is precisely because of its extraordinary characteristics that the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will take in various chamfers, which will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, the Corso Como, until the 15. November is to be carried out.
The first chamfer will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como are intended to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will thus seemingly emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments in order to reassemble on it as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new way of authoring the record in this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be possible to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are just these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling after the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans so far.
The origin of the group lies in the right-wing environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: these were removed on Saturday, however, to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it came to a collision with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 tickets had been made available to the Italian fans for the game: all were exhibited by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, no one was with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already burdened in this respect, were thus also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested Tifosi or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation offenders, who could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be leaked immediately, and that in no case give such behavior the opportunity to justify it," the Viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on especially with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Authority) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, this is not a criminal offence..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (significantly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio at the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and on it Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now comes a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
True, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – Crimes are punished in the land of their deed.
Until now, this group had kept itself in check, but now it must be reconsidered what has happened and will happen.
But we are also talking about the whistles during the anthem of Mameli: even this is not a criminal offence, but they allow me, there is a lack of education..."
Female students Victims of the up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students knows no crises.
According to the latest investigation by the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. In fact, whole crowds of students lose their right to study, since their families are not able to support them at this level” – according to the Sunia’s manager, Laura Mariani – “in these cities, the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also harmed the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without a rental price limit, unauthorized sublets.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures that lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
On closer inspection of the study, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the district of Brianza approx. 450 euros are needed; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter of gangs of Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the district of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the district of Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, are 250/280 euros for a place to sleep of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities in Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge to outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death for the single-room cinema in the centre in the long run. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have covered a piece of road full of emotions," according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," who earned him the Oscar and the Cannes Grand Prix 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this mine paid for the most part the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but in the first place is the preservation of the already existing one, because closes a hall in the city, not all of his regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is approx. 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical-moral standpoint that the government does not comply with existing laws.
To preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be necessary.
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the foreseen measures are also tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a pleasing initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" by Baghiera, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the legal profession of the antimafia authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted for involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
“Thus, it had been made possible for the Mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls on an official way and to co-determine the politics of public administration.”
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to encounter links from local administrations and organized crime." “There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 run-off election.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He prosecuted to Vice Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons. The judges, however, declare in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From a wiretap in connection with the investigations of the case of Dal Torrione, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – which made the measures of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan.
When the energy springs from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a non-drying source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now do the world’s great energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking to occupy, such as giants such as Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not coincidentally, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impulses in the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy demand could be met by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also the currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” according to the spokesperson for a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us.”
It is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, especially considering that oil is still being extracted by the U.S. in Alaska and President Bush was just recently starting plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are also not known, observers speak of a rising interest.
Still needing improvement technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still in the making of its way, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval. Some of the energy generated could also serve for military facilities.
Verdant Power, meanwhile, is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in New York's East River.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator as a result of the rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of possible clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Generation Research, a special interest immediately deserves the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more trustworthy power source.
It is precisely tidal energy that caused states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
