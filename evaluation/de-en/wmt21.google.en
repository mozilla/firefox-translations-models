Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks bikers
At around 9:30 p.m., a 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left in her VW from Merklingen onto state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
Here she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen, who had the right of way.
In the collision, the hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still brushed against it at the rear of the vehicle.
The hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off as a result of the scraping process and the driver was no longer able to brake.
With quick-wittedness he steered his motorcycle into the green strips next to the road and let it coast there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
As a result of the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to his leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are in quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the serial examination, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
&quot;In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population,&quot; explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: &quot;According to our information, it is a closed group of people&quot;.
Infected employees were separated from non-infected employees in the yard, and the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD shared responsibility with the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.
&quot;This can take its toll if such local infections spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered,&quot; said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
The SPD sees it very similarly: &quot;After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers,&quot; said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
&quot;In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions in particular must be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn&#39;t happen.&quot;
The outbreak came &quot;with announcement&quot;.
Aidenbachstraße underground station: Dangerous argument: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after being pushed
During a dispute between two groups of young people at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell over and slipped onto the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday at around 4.15 p.m. there was a dispute between two groups of young people at the Aidenbachstrasse underground station.
A passer-by alerted the police, who came with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a 17-year-old from Munich pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell onto the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old&#39;s group helped the fallen person to climb off the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
According to the police, there were arguments between the two people afterwards.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene of the crime, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police station 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is calling for the storage period to be extended.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for data retention to be extended - instead of the planned ten weeks, half a year.
As the &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense &quot;to make urgently needed adjustments to the law now,&quot; the newspaper quoted from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is awaited.
But Seehofer wants the changes beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report goes on to say.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only make sense to examine whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in favor of data retention in June.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he also visited the &quot;Magic City&quot; strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who, according to ESPN, is said to have admitted the visit, is back in isolation and is being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: chicken wings.
In February last year, &quot;Sweet Lou&quot;, as he is known in the NBA, already expressed his love for these wings.
The American wrote: &quot;Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, ed.) have the best wings in town&quot;.
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA had imposed a ten-day quarantine on Williams.
The Clippers star will thus miss the first two official games after the friendly phase.
The NBA wants to finish the Corona season at Disney World.
The best 22 teams are currently preparing with training games for the season finale, which begins on Friday night.
Söder comments on the corona situation after a mass infection
Munich – Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be broadcast live on our website.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has alarmed the authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The yard is now under quarantine and cordoned off with a site fence.
Nobody is allowed to leave the premises, groceries are delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to the 3,300 residents of the community.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
&quot;Pangs of conscience&quot;: confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
&quot;My client has been cooperative,&quot; attorney Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: &quot;He deeply regrets the crimes, the confession was a liberation for him&quot;.
His mandate was &quot;plagued by remorse and badly affected by the extent of the destruction&quot;.
According to the public prosecutor, if convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out in three widely separated places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, who is now in custody, was arrested a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a forced entry into the church, he quickly came to the attention of the investigators.
Discuss abolishing the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering abolishing the 50+1 rule.
&quot;German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli,&quot; Grindel told the &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot;.
He emphasized: &quot;For the clubs that are most likely to threaten Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules don&#39;t work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is necessary to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors&quot;.
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority holdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
&quot;There is still a legal risk of putting investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market,&quot; said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that &quot;attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship&quot;.
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
&quot;FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences between the top three clubs alone are immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,&quot; explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
&quot;Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this error and spoke to the press instead of speaking to me about it,&quot; Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
&quot;That has really concerned me as a person.&quot;
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
&quot;I committed a compliance violation and it was right to take the consequences,&quot; said Grindel.
&quot;I was completely transparent and unsuspecting about the ominous watch gift.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.&quot;
He never &quot;made a secret of the gift,&quot; assured the 58-year-old.
&quot;You might call that naïve, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.&quot;
&quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;: Injured and one dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again due to Donald Trump&#39;s deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and police officers in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire as a marcher crossed an intersection.
Clashes had previously broken out again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid at her Louisville home in March.
The raid targeted someone else who didn&#39;t live there, and no drugs were found.
Three people were injured when a member of a group that describes itself as the Black American Armed Alliance fired a shot on Saturday.
According to the broadcaster NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them was in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators from a white militia had formed.
Ultimately, the two groups did not meet.
One person was shot and killed during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Austin, Texas.
The police said they took a suspect into custody.
So far, she has not provided any further information about the circumstances of the crime.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said he was, like many in the city, &quot;heartbroken and stunned&quot; by what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, demonstrators also clashed with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to a trailer in front of a juvenile prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
A courthouse was set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of demonstrators smashed windows, shot off firecrackers and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a Denver, Colorado suburb, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a freeway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to the hospital.
Windows were also smashed in a court there and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations have started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although there was no big party in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative programme.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without a Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as the Saale Burns, the Rakoczy Ball or the pageant, many got their money&#39;s worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
&quot;I think we managed to spread Rakoczy flair,&quot; says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, we are returning to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when the focus of the festival was solely on the historical.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy Festival for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watch the historic people strolling and listen to the live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
&quot;I also find it very pleasant,&quot; says Konhäuser.
She doesn&#39;t miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historical procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
&quot;That&#39;s a pity.
The weather would have been great this year,&quot; she says.
Rakoczy horse show is to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the pageant in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she walked around town in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
&quot;It&#39;s more strenuous, otherwise it&#39;s easier for us,&quot; she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were out and about in the park.
&quot;We very much hope that the rider quadrille will be able to take place again next year,&quot; says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy horse show will take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division soccer team CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20 despite the first corona cases, one setback has followed the next.
As of Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, and one was hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had a chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now there is even a threat of relegation to the B group of the second division.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the public prosecutor&#39;s office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
&quot;They did not receive a fresh towel and gel until the sixth day of quarantine,&quot; wrote the sports newspaper &quot;AS&quot;.
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after apparently having to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
&quot;AS&quot; wrote that it was neither good nor sufficient.
The club management said, however, that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club&#39;s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, dismissed the accusation of intentionally endangering public health.
The son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, emphasized that the Corona rules set by the football association had not been violated, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper &quot;Marca&quot;.
Before departure, there were four infected people up to July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for &quot;five or six&quot; other team members.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch runaway horses near Dampfach
Two animals were walking on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 a.m., a road user reported two free-running horses on the feeder road between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
Shortly before Dampfach, the officers gained the trust of the horses, and each had a rope carried in the patrol car attached to them.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: conceivable career continuation
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
&quot;I am currently setting out the general conditions with the team as to how and in what form things could continue,&quot; said the 35-year-old of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung&quot;.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and before the Corona break he had considered retiring after this year.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of racing days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a father, said Martin.
He used to get up after a fall and the first thought was: &quot;Quickly get back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if&quot;.
The professional cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
&quot;But it was good for me to realize what I have in cycling and how much fun I enjoy it, based on the Corona period.&quot;
The time trial specialist will be back in action at the Tour de l&#39;Ain (5th to 9th August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria&#39;s streets over the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the motorcycle tour ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal – Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria&#39;s roads at the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car on Saturday near Schönthal (Cham district) that came into the opposite lane.
It was initially unclear why the car went into the opposite lane.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old crashed into his machine with a horse-drawn carriage on Saturday.
According to the police, he was going downhill near Beilngries.
In a left turn, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, the police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He lay down on a street on Sunday night and was run over by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver was unable to brake in time.
On Saturday near Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district), a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on into a car in a right-hand bend despite emergency braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car were unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed by Bavaria&#39;s Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU) on Saturday.
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on crash barriers and the defusing of dangerous curves.
&quot;We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years,&quot; the letter said.
&quot;The number of motorized two-wheelers killed was reduced by around 28 percent compared to 2011.&quot;
Kovac is testing with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be visiting Hessen, the Croatian&#39;s former club, on August 1 (6 p.m.).
For the Bundesliga side it is the first and only endurance test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (August 6).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be held without spectators.
&quot;We&#39;re really looking forward to this game.
It&#39;s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,&quot; said Kovac.
In terms of sport, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before moving to Bayern Munich, Kovac coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
&quot;A high-level opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in view of the game against Basel.
Like everyone in Frankfurt, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,&quot; said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, Frankfurt lost the round of 16 first leg against Basel in their own stadium 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Hof district just past the lockdown
In the Hof district, the number of known new corona infections increased further at the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer included in these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
There is also a case in the city of Hof.
The Hof area is thus approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 killed by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people have been affected by the severe flooding in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people lost their lives due to the heavy monsoon rains.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent uses boats to reach the isolated people.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their harvests.
Indian rhinos die in national park from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Indian rhinos died in landslides.
They are under protection and classified as Critically Endangered.
The floods are particularly bad this year, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries hardest hit by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox&#39;s Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 people displaced by the floods.
Only a few have moved in so far.
It&#39;s difficult to get people to Cox&#39;s Bazar.
The enthusiasm also keeps within bounds.
Anyone who used to have a house, no matter how small it was and resembled a hut, often does not want to live in a large block of flats.
Many apartments are empty, but the government wants them to be occupied soon by those who lost their homes in the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday that the new demands could not be met.
&quot;That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair,&quot; it said in a statement.
&quot;While 50 percent of Argentina&#39;s children live in poverty, we cannot increase short-term gains for our creditors.&quot;
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Argentina is therefore asking its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is threatened with bankruptcy again.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina&#39;s history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts are expecting a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay $503 million in interest owed, putting itself in a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
&quot;It&#39;s going really well&quot; - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary&#39;s office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary&#39;s office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
&quot;However, I still have to arrive privately,&quot; she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the Dingolfing native.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, the 39-year-old explains that for the time being she has a place to stay overnight with her parents in Dingolfing.
Having grown up in the neighboring district, she has of course been familiar with the town of Eggenfelden for a long time.
During visits to the site with her family in the past few months, she found out again: &quot;Eggenfelden is a really nice small town&quot;.
She was all the more pleased that she won the race for the vacancy in the selection process.
Also in Dr. Her homeland of Lower Bavaria plays a central role in Stefanie Kramer&#39;s professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a trainee notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered the doctorate in labor law &quot;on the side&quot; - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the Passau district in 2012 at.
In 2016 she went on maternity leave and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken on representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of Lutz Feller&#39;s approaching retirement, she saw the right time to return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer took over completely - and immediately had a word of praise for the law firm&#39;s team: &quot;It&#39;s going really well!&quot;
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private life.
She has already contacted a local facility about places in a kindergarten or crèche.
And if everything goes as planned, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the loveliest jogging trails in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if a fan returns.
&quot;Due to the distance regulation, which must be observed, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators,&quot; said Borussia Dortmund&#39;s managing director Carsten Cramer to the &quot;Tagesspiegel&quot;.
The arena in the Revierstadt normally holds a little more than 81,000 spectators during Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: &quot;Of course, it&#39;s a slap in the office if this income collapses completely&quot;.
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently “well advised to first take a stable side length”.
&quot;If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited,&quot; explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: &quot;Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we had 100 people who work in merchandising set short-time work&quot;.
Tiny miracles: an early start to life with just a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for every year at the Graz children&#39;s clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight, weighing less than a kilogram at birth.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could damage the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they couldn&#39;t speak - &quot;and how&quot;, smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
&quot;Even if they don&#39;t cry quite as loudly as big babies, of course.&quot;
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The 9th graders of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage just before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production &quot;Das Heimatdress&quot; to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk to the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born out of the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if all those involved agreed in the end that direct encounters in the theater and stage area would offer additional attractions, the potential for contact with schools can also be seen in the theatre.
&quot;If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could become an interesting addition to the game,&quot; emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich – Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt if they qualified successfully.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary resignation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4th or 5th).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second division promoted Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already have qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against regional league team Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between September 11th and 14th, one week before the start of the third division.
&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;: film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic Gone with the Wind (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theater man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream&quot;.
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and made her big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar for the leading role in To Each His Own.
The film ran in Germany under the title &quot;Mother&#39;s Heart&quot;.
Three years later came the Best Actress award for William Wyler&#39;s The Heiress.
She was also widely recognized as a neurotic eccentric in The Dark Mirror and The Snake Pit.
Daphne du Maurier suggested her for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; in 1952.
The play became a worldwide success.
She starred in &quot;Lullaby for a Corpse&quot; with longtime friend Bette Davis.
From the marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had their daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
“Road to Timmendorf”: Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss the final when they come back
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final of the &quot;Road to Timmendorf&quot; beach volleyball tournament.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semifinals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen suffered a 0:2 (17:21, 17:21) defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships in Timmendorfer Strand were played at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer secured the tickets, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured them.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of &quot;fig leaf&quot;
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is just a &quot;fig leaf&quot; and does not change the character of the party.
&quot;The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,&quot; said FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, which the federal executive board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
&quot;If the AfD were really concerned with consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago,&quot; said Strasser.
&quot;However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.&quot;
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume made a similar statement: &quot;The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded doesn&#39;t say anything and doesn&#39;t change anything,&quot; he told the &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
&quot;Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD.&quot;
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up under five percent again in future elections.
&quot;The days of the AfD in parliament are numbered&quot;.
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the now officially dissolved &quot;wing&quot; around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group leader Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the Strönung as a &quot;certain right-wing extremist effort&quot;.
In May, the AfD federal executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason he gave was that when he joined the party, Kalbitz had not stated that he was a member of the now banned right-wing extremist &quot;Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend&quot; (HDJ) and of the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also emphasized that the decision of the federal arbitration court did not change the character of the AfD: &quot;The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz.&quot;
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
&quot;The maneuvers of the Meuthen troops are transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get under the radar,&quot; said Walter.
&quot;The AfD can&#39;t get rid of the ghosts it called.
Being kicked out doesn&#39;t change anything,&quot; commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
&quot;Here, the AfD state association and the parliamentary group stuck to their right-wing leader to this day.&quot;
The legal dispute over Kalbitz&#39;s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That&#39;s a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, according to the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transmitting North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to Tennet&#39;s grid area, fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from the wind conditions and higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; According to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it should increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
&quot;In Germany and the Netherlands we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then,&quot; said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art &quot;Skirmish&quot; - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small 130th anniversary celebration.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition &quot;Skirmish&quot; with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual framework after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The band &quot;Defenders of the Universe&quot; provided the musical equivalent on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The &quot;Sandtogether&quot; association was active north of the gallery.
Freital: Windberg Festival canceled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people attended this city festival.
&quot;We really didn&#39;t take this decision lightly and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute,&quot; said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (independent).
&quot;But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people.&quot;
Because if tens of thousands had streamed onto the festival grounds and into the festival tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current Corona Protection Ordinance could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary, among other things, with the Winterberg Festival from May 7th to 9th, 2021 and the Day of Saxony from September 10th to 12th, 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth unbeatable in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg achieved four wins in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special and in the Freestyle on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
Also in the freestyle on Saturday the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth&#39;s winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world should establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled there for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University goes further into the air: &quot;DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung&quot; donates a professorship for &quot;Air Traffic Management&quot;.
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start your studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and the DFS air traffic control academy are being utilized evenly.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS have been very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot job.
&quot;In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly believe that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to continue to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,&quot; said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of DFS, when the contract was signed.
&quot;For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer&quot;.
This is also emphasized by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: &quot;The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor&#39;s degree in Air Traffic Management&quot;.
The trust of the German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for the Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air traffic.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
dr Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: &quot;With its focus on air traffic, the Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today&#39;s signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university&quot;.
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was completely closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon because the rescue helicopter was in action after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford around 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed on the guardrail.
The front airbags deployed as a result of the impact, and the driver suffered minor facial injuries and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries to the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital in a rescue helicopter.
The police are currently assuming that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of around 2,000 euros, had to be towed away.
After the meat industry, Heil wants to check other sectors
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they legal - and will it stay that way?
Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors according to the strict regulations now planned against abuses in the meat industry.
&quot;We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary,&quot; Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany&#39;s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughtering, cutting up and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers should be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: &quot;Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary workers if you don&#39;t want to completely stall the economy&quot;.
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for value creation for customers in large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction.
&quot;The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument&quot;.
Heil assured: &quot;My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy&quot;.
Work contracts make sense.
&quot;If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, that&#39;s a completely normal work contract&quot;.
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work alone in their industry to be unconstitutional.
It cannot be explained why different labor laws should apply to the portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausages, according to a statement on the proposed law, as reported by the &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot; (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW occupational safety and health administration, many Eastern European employees from contractors work in the industry for 16 hours a day.
Often they didn&#39;t have a break.
Wages were withheld for protective gear or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law came into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by &quot;tricky constructions&quot;.
&quot;Now we have to clean up fundamentally&quot;.
The politician announced: &quot;The Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example higher test rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for communal accommodation&quot;.
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding employee rights in the meat industry and the occupational health and safety law.
Brandenburg&#39;s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
&quot;I would wish that we could do more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport,&quot; said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB program &quot;Brandenburg aktuell&quot;.
But for more controls, more staff are needed.
Three dead in microlight crash in Germany
According to the police, three people died when an ultralight aircraft crashed on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
A spokesman for the Wesel district control center said two other people were injured in the accident.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The &quot;Rheinische Post&quot; reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially known.
Clearing of Frankfurt&#39;s Opernplatz went peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the clearing of the Opernplatz on Sunday night also went peacefully.
At the end of the day, a few dozen people were still in the square, but they left before the curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police presence could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the opera square, where there had been riots a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
According to police reports, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles damaged.
Saturday night was also quiet.
Car rolls over: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries around 1:25 p.m. on Sunday.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was traveling on federal highway 83 in the direction of her home in Hümme when her car left the roadway for reasons that have not yet been clarified and rolled over several times.
In order to save the victim, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The squadron of drones from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services found no one between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured was taken by ambulance to the Kassel Clinic for further care.
Almost 50 emergency services from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus champions in Italy
Turin – After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world soccer player completed the 36th Scudetto in the club&#39;s history with a 2-0 (1-0) win on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin, who started without the recently injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be dislodged from first place two games before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Despite their visual superiority, Juventus were harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo scored with the last action after a free-kick variant.
The 35-year-old converted a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot (45+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured a lackluster but decisive success.
The penalty kick missed on the bar in the 89th minute should only have annoyed Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorer rating.
&quot;It&#39;s difficult to stay mentally and physically on the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and momentum changes very easily,&quot; said coach Maurizio Sarri after Thursday&#39;s 2-1 draw at Udinese Calcio.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, Turin had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve owed the reassuring lead at the top of the table above all to the weakness of their competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his hat-trick in fourth-placed Lazio Rome&#39;s 5-1 (1-1) win at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski to win the title of FC Bayern contributed.
The current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next chance for the title awaits the &quot;old lady&quot; of Italian football.
Juventus are in the last 16 of the Champions League but need to recover from a 1-0 defeat by Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the finals in Lisbon.
In the next knockout stage, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all the penalties and court rulings threatened, drivers continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the speeders are making the judicial authorities work more and more: the public prosecutor&#39;s offices between Constance and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations into illegal racing in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year up to Already 151 at the beginning of June.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the Interior Ministry&#39;s response to a request from the SPD state parliament.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
Most of the drivers were German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the number of tragic accidents and processes in recent years and reported them more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, drivers slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the open road for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular &quot;race track&quot;
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and souped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because the drivers switch to Germany because of the high penalties for speeding and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to just a few stretches: &quot;With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on the autobahn,&quot; says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert for the SPD parliamentary group.
&quot;The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren&#39;t allowed to legally drive at 200 kilometers per hour and more here and there&quot;.
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: &quot;Anyone who ignores all the rules in this way and not only jeopardizes their own lives but also the lives of other road users can hardly be reached with reason.&quot;
ADAC calls for stronger police action
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not enough: &quot;We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits,&quot; says Holger Bach, Head of Traffic and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-speed showdown to become more painful and serious: since January 2019 and up to April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them bystanders in a night-time crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have had a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles went off the road, hit a garden wall and lay on its side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, stricter penalties are not necessary: &quot;There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely,&quot; says the Interior Ministry paper.
Blue light from July 23rd: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises on Talstrasse at around 3:40 a.m. and ran in the direction of the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who was helping himself to drinks from the refrigerator and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed-in front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong build.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and light-colored shoes.
The police are taking further information from witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage of Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann fought his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from the Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in a mass sprint on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Sibiu after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the third and fourth win of the season for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders had lined up for the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters fell victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
&quot;I&#39;m really happy to start the new season with a win,&quot; said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
&quot;The sprint was really hectic,&quot; said the 26-year-old.
With 300 meters to go, he simply picked up his sprint, &quot;and it worked out perfectly.&quot;
In accordance with the rules of the world association UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
The control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf – Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came in just before 1 p.m.
&quot;A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation,&quot; a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely began investigating how the accident happened.
The fire brigade spokesman: &quot;We assume a tragic accident in the apartment&quot;.
Nuremberg: unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1,000 people took part in a &quot;tuning meeting&quot; in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement that such events would be monitored more closely.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in the south of Nuremberg.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia police, around 10:30 p.m. the Nuremberg traffic police noticed an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large car park on Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
The police only recently announced that they wanted to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the &quot;scene&quot;
The officials counted a good 700 vehicles and around 1,100 people at the top, according to the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be assigned to the &quot;autoposer&quot; and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular keeping the minimum distance and wearing a mouth and nose protector.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
&quot;The police headquarters in Central Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the appearance of onlookers,&quot; it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: &quot;They all have nice rims, we mustn&#39;t scratch them,&quot; said Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to damage anything.
&quot;After all, young people should get their cars back undamaged.&quot;
Figures from the employment agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse during short-time work
According to its own statements, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work benefits.
&quot;That&#39;s extremely little with more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work,&quot; said Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for the operative business of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;.
When a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the Corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
The test usually takes up to three weeks.
&quot;We didn&#39;t have that much time in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will definitely be a lot more to come.
We are not naïve and have staying power&quot;.
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of bankruptcies in the fall.
&quot;Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the worst case scenario and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money&quot;.
The numbers are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam – About 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden on Friday evening.
The collection was broken up at 8:48 p.m. by the patrol drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said when asked by PNN.
The teenagers then left the park.
On Saturday evening some young people played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the foundation&#39;s parks, there are always gatherings where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Handling Ordinance are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with around 300 people in Babelsberg Park, and a week later around 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed at nightfall.
According to the park regulations, camping on the meadows is prohibited, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish behind and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as announced by the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to remain in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
&quot;There are cancellations and cancellations&quot; of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, of the dpa.
A few guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
The first infections became public knowledge on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several bars and could have been infected there.
&quot;We all liked to do that when we were young,&quot; he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to sensitize young employees to the dangers of Covid-19.
Hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were then tested from Saturday.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread across Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of focus for new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (AP) - The English soccer record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year&#39;s absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over their direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea passed them and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
Aston Villa was allowed to celebrate in the fight against relegation.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90+8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45+1) and Olivier Giroud (45+4).
&quot;It means a lot to me,&quot; said manager Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season at Chelsea.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea&#39;s win against Wolverhampton, who overtook Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) win at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
Jack Grealish&#39;s late lead (84&#39;) was immediately equalized by Andrei Jarmolenko (85&#39;).
The 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches during the season, is relegated after five years in the top division.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn&#39;t save themselves with a 3-1 (2-1) win at Everton.
At the end one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle had taken the lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38&#39;), Divock Origi (59&#39;) and Sadio Mané (89&#39;) turned the game around for Liverpool on Sunday.
&quot;It&#39;s been an exceptional season for this wonderful club,&quot; said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, &quot;that should spur us on to defend the title.
It&#39;s going to be difficult&quot;.
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Football in England was suspended from March 13th to June 17th due to the coronavirus crisis.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about stopping the game early or playing the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any major incidents - albeit without spectators in the stadiums, as in Germany.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
Violent clashes broke out during the night.
The Israeli police used violence against participants in a demonstration against right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for taking part in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu&#39;s official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu&#39;s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters banged drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site &quot;ynet&quot; reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister&#39;s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man has been arrested near Tel Aviv, according to police, on suspicion of spraying pepper spray at roadside demonstrators from a moving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator suffered minor injuries in the neck.
There have recently been multiple demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hit the country&#39;s economy hard.
The unemployment rate was recently more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the corona virus in Israel has recently risen to new record values.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - van crashes into car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen – A rear-end collision on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon caused nine minor injuries.
A driver was driving towards Beckum with her two children (3, 5).
The police: &quot;Presumably she suddenly braked because she wanted to turn&quot;.
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen that too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van suffered minor injuries in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after suspected corona case
So far, North Korea has seen a &quot;bright success&quot; in its own measures to defend against the corona virus.
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of the first official suspected case of corona in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological countermeasures over the past six months, &quot;the malicious virus may have been introduced into the country,&quot; state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea says it has not registered a single infection so far and has described its defense measures as a &quot;radiant success&quot;.
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a &quot;runaway&quot; who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea that the border had been crossed within the four-kilometer-wide military buffer zone that was still largely mined.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea&#39;s military acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were investigations into some people.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers&#39; Party chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday about the suspected case.
The &quot;dangerous situation in Kaesong could unleash a deadly and devastating disaster&quot;.
As a preventive measure, Kim ordered &quot;to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others&quot; on Friday, it said.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her were quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the &quot;runaway case&quot; and the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
According to estimates, around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Excitement before the council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before the long summer break
&quot;In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale downtown development east project,&quot; says the middle section of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majorities in favor are narrow, recently even negative in individual committees, depending on attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council, fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as &quot;extra-parliamentary opposition&quot;. &quot;unaware&quot;, &quot;speculation&quot;, &quot;denigration&quot; and &quot;deliberate false statements&quot;.
&quot;Everyone thinks they know better,&quot; says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year and is the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens&#39; List.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: &quot;I know what I&#39;m talking about&quot;.
The exit is cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is to be renovated for 8.5 million euros, contrary to statements by the city administration after subsidies, of which Klein is convinced.
The city will develop very differently from what was forecast in the town hall and by the advocates from the economy.
Shaping the city through your own efforts and not an investor: that was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administration areas and a small-scale redesign of the inner city, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. The politicians in the city are not innocent that this has to happen because they neglect regular bus services with thinned out intervals and little commitment to cycling have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is joining the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal day-care centers and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a long delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener did his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in a GT3 car.
&quot;There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season,&quot; says Zimmermann.
&quot;With ABS, for example, you have to take corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun.&quot;
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
&quot;I&#39;m not a motorsport beginner, but every new series also brings new challenges,&quot; says Zimmermann.
&quot;Steijn and I get along really well and we&#39;ve made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring.&quot;
This is exactly where - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will hold its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track.
He was last a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
&quot;It worked quickly and I didn&#39;t have to get used to the track very much,&quot; says Zimmermann, who competes for the Graf Zeppelin racing community in Friedrichshafen.
&quot;The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast.&quot;
How fast Zimmermann really is will become clear in two weeks.
&quot;Of course, the teams gamble a bit during the tests,&quot; he says.
&quot;In the end we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring&quot;.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
There are seven races scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT steering wheel.
British transport minister caught off guard by quarantine order
According to press reports, the British government&#39;s decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return caught the country&#39;s Minister of Transport off guard.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be in quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the rule will only apply to those who are just on holiday on the cut-off date from Saturday 1 August and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain has so far been considered one of the &quot;safe countries&quot; in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
&quot;Many ministers may have known in advance that there was a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers to Spain,&quot; commented Labor MP Diane Abbot.
&quot;But nobody seems to have bothered to tell Grant Shapps.&quot;
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is increasing again.
Virologists blame nightlife in particular for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favorite holiday destinations for the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that his country&#39;s warships will be equipped with the latest hypersonic weapons on Navy Day.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
The underwater torpedo Poseidon, which can be equipped with nuclear weapons, will continue to be built, it said.
The proposed sea drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who also sailed in a military boat himself, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual naval associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
The Navy has been reliably protecting Russia for 300 years, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
The naval forces also celebrated Navy Day with parades in many other Russian coastal towns.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated their strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets.
Hurricane &quot;Hanna&quot; reaches Texas: Help made difficult because of Corona
WASHINGTON - The first hurricane of this year&#39;s Atlantic season has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the US state, said the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency in several counties.
The corona pandemic that is rampant in Texas is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to the US media.
Evacuees cautioned
&quot;Every hurricane is an enormous challenge,&quot; Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the hurricane in Texas, he added, &quot;This challenge is complicated and is compounded when you consider that it is sweeping through what is the state&#39;s worst-hit area by Covid-19.&quot;
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who would have to leave their homes to exercise caution.
They shouldn&#39;t disregard practices &quot;to which we&#39;ve become accustomed,&quot; such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been made available in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for Corona.
Damage was initially only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, &quot;Hanna&quot; hit Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
A storm surge warning was initially issued for the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities are expecting a slowdown as &quot;Hanna&quot; moves further inland and toward northeastern Mexico.
&quot;Douglas&quot; is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading towards Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it should be near the largest islands in Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
According to a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
Up to ten hurricanes can be expected from June to the end of November, of which up to six could be very strong cyclones, the authority had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of a below-average only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is monitoring the storms closely and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals disallowed: video assistant &#39;punishes&#39; Sassuolo
Sassuolo&#39;s Filip Djuricic were disallowed two goals
Naples – four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening at 0: 2 (0: 1) at SSC Naples in the Italian soccer league Serie A – and was really angry with the video assistant of the referee.
&quot;A festival of unsuccessful goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never acted so hard against a team,&quot; commented the &quot;Corriere dello Sport&quot;.
Hosts Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute through a goal by full-back Elseid Hisaj, and in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially celebrated the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) ruled the goal out for offside.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - VAR intervened again.
The referee team also withdrew the goals from attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) after being advised by VAR.
In added time, Allan made it 2-0 for Napoli and a bitter evening for Sassuolo.
&quot;The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a speed trap on the road and is punishing Sassuolo like no team has before.
The new technology sets records,&quot; writes the &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;.
Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winners FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered &quot;reasonably well&quot; after a short vacation and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury to world champion Benjamin Pavard after the first team training session.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and is in danger of missing decisive premier class duels.
In Munich&#39;s bad weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the field in a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
Playing in the second leg of the round of 16 against Chelsea on August 8th should be difficult, but the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament that begins on August 12th in Lisbon.
Bayern don&#39;t want to let the mishap from Sunday&#39;s training stop them.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes that he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal&#39;s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final on August 23rd.
&quot;We have simply mastered the mandatory tasks with the championship and the cup.
Now it&#39;s time to create something special,&quot; said Flick.
Before the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve beforehand, they have to play against Chelsea in the round of 16.
After the 3-0 win in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in their home arena, as they did in the lost &quot;Finale dahoam&quot; in 2012.
&quot;We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,&quot; demanded Flick.
A warm-up test is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time since moving from Manchester City.
&quot;Like all the newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well,&quot; reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané &amp; Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the Londoners are now training as a team, which, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, is in the rhythm of the game.
After that, Munich could face a quarterfinal against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semifinals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A route to the final in Lisbon &quot;isn&#39;t that easy,&quot; emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 preparation.
Working with his current team is &quot;a pleasure&quot;, praised Flick.
The &quot;focus on winning&quot; is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with teams of nine on Sunday was also ambitious.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago, who was willing to emigrate, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the premier class season are not certain.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world championship titles.
All America races have been canceled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more specific
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed grand prix so far, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, it will be driven at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will be fighting for World Championship points on the traditional Italian circuit in Imola.
The 2020 racing calendar currently has 13 races.
&quot;We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in finalizing our plans for the 2020 season,&quot; said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the already officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the world championship.
Even if, as is currently planned, only two continents will be raced, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing “extraordinary circumstances” due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be canceled at short notice due to the looming corona crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be visiting America this year.
Cancellation met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
&quot;We look forward to being with them again next season,&quot; said Carey.
The cancellation of the America races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: &quot;The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it,&quot; said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a refusal.
We are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert&#39;s well-known late-night show via video link and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video link.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous &quot;evil eye&quot; when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - For the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has garnered attention for her tireless efforts with the &quot;Fridays For Future&quot; movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known late night show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late night presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful in the world.
&quot;There are some things that surprised me,&quot; she said.
&quot;How far people go to take the focus away from the climate crisis,&quot; she was shocked.
She has experienced &quot;everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets&quot;.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her or even try to silence her on social media &quot;funny&quot; because the reactions show her &quot;since they have no other answer to it&quot;.
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the internet.
The short clip became a GIF, an animated image, which eventually became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at that moment?
When asked a relatively open question by Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: &quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t think that needs any further explanation&quot;.
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a short laugh.
With her &quot;How dare you?&quot; speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life has been a roller coaster ride: after a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, with further statements expected in the coming days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional response, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a &quot;monumental loss&quot; for all members of Fleetwood Mac, past and present.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green founded the now legendary band in London in 1967. His dreamy instrumental hit &quot;Albatross&quot; is still unforgettable today.
The musician&#39;s life (&quot;The End Of The Game&quot;, &quot;In The Skies&quot;) was like a roller coaster ride.
Green experienced a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac - but the band then celebrated their greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there is said to have been a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group&#39;s profits to charity.
He began to appear in loose robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental health problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970, just three years after its formation.
Social decline followed.
The blues-rock guitarist suffered from substance abuse and schizophrenia, according to biographers.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
For much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a time on an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 into a Jewish working-class family in London&#39;s Bethnal Green.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as BB King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned his first guitar moves.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B&#39;s Looners.
A little later he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the summer of 1967, in the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
Green&#39;s song &quot;Albatross&quot; gave the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green couldn&#39;t cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: &quot;The worst thing that has happened to me in life are the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit&quot;.
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprise hit in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac meanwhile swam in a new formation on a wave of success without him.
Their 1977 album Rumors sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
At the time, the British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; spoke of a rock star who had returned to earth.
Drug free, Green released a few albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
