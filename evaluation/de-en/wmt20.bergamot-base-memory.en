Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within a 500-metre radius were evacuated, with schools and kindergartens closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which stipulates particularly strict security requirements.
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methane thiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the environment smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an accident at work, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run off from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days was missing from the bitch any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got nauseous," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but to no avail.
Donner had put dog in a panic
Hoping Katie might still be staying at the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the front desk. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago,"" Carole King recalls to Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and views in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I've never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man came forward and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King got there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to Daily Inter Lake. "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found it."
Bundeswehr losses: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six machine guns of the type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" scale.
In the case of the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident from a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which is classified as classified, which the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland reports on.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a piece of weapons and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared so far. The weapons and weapon parts that have still disappeared are, among other things, six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven rifles of type G3, four rifles of type G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 gun barrels for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The volume of gun and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr is "frightening," said Martina Renner, a member of the Left Bundestag. This was all the more true, since hardly anything had been found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "sleek balance sheet." Renner criticized that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigation against the suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A.. "And that's despite the fact that a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was given as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said it was waiting for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was on the 19th. July was raised by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the lake road of Hormuz under accusation of having violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The state security has been taken away from the horrors," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold record. Despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog "Electrek."
Demand is strong, so Tesla could place 110000 orders, Musk's circular said. The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla would have to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-figure figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so fiercely against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even before touch. This is due to a low-lying layer in the cerebrium, which already triggers the laughter in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touch. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign contact and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were amplified.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-touching and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In the process, they sometimes prematurely broke off this initiation in the experiment, showing flight behavior or stare. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and people.
Disaster averted: Major fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy told the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have leaked out. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within a 500-metre radius were evacuated, with schools and kindergartens closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticised by own sister
The prime minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in parliament after Wednesday night's lifting of the forced recess. The Prime Minister is threatening to see the country on 31. Taking October without a deal from the EU should Brussels not get involved in its calls for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he intends to achieve this, however, is unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Premier said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to make this country one again would be to make the EU exit." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum election campaign.
Memorial to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They are reminiscent of the roses that thousands of people had deposited in Oslo Cathedral in the days and weeks after the attacks.
At the same location, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to attend the opening.
Right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had 22 on the 22nd July 2011, a car bomb detonated in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The U.N. General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai, among other things, for medical examinations, explained shipping company chief Erik Hånell. By noon, the ship had left the Iranian waters. "Nice to have it over," he told Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the arrest of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards had the tanker on the 19th. July, under the accusation of having violated regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They would have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunite it with its families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected behind the arrest of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: In early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been intended for Syria, was put on the chain. The shipment, according to the authorities, violated EU sanctions against the war-torn country of Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected assumptions that it was a barter business to free the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The U.S. single-handedly pulled out of the international nuclear deal in 2018, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended agreement to other territories. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. is working on a coalition for military protection of the merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined a "war-finisher." In the face of the punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese manufacturers by America's President Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reschedule. Chief financial officers of Asian firms considering moving their production from China to another country, India cited in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. This does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be creating a more significant role in the globally swept-up production chain.
But now India itself has come into focus. Derogatoryly labeled by the Haudegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Tariffs," America stripped the emerging market of the trade concessions for 2000 products in early June. The U.S. prohibitively accuses India of high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India, of course, merely represent a side show. In addition, America also considers the world’s largest democracy through safety-political glasses. Delhi and Washington share concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just run for a second five-year term, is likely to weigh himself to safety.
The problem, however, lies in another place: The empirically confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive construction permits for buildings faster. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more handy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic optic, much has turned for the better in India in the first five Modi years. But this does not apply in trade policy. Animated by the fact that companies that are not competitive internationally protected from foreign providers, the national conservative government even set new barriers.
In the West, Modi is attaching the nimbus of the energetic reformer, which radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well which vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, however, the "India First" advocate never backed away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the foreclosure of their industries are among the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, applauding this short-sighted politics.
Jacques Chirac funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. A public funeral service was scheduled for Sunday in Paris's Invalidendom, according to media reports.
The competitor is carried to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world leader was already in the finish line when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium. In the first lead-up of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to sway dangerously. He could barely keep himself on his feet a good 300 meters before the finish, running in an unhealthy stuck position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hooked him under and hauled him supportively the last half-stadium round to the finish. However, the forces were still enough for both to stop the running wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene hadn't been curious enough already.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shetyly dodged, did not want to talk at all about his feat. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this was going to be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't have even started. "That's why I'm proud to walk here for my country," he said.
He did that that evening with emphasis - and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead-up. In the end, everything had used nothing, because the busby, which only came to the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the world athletics association in the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I’ve been under 18 minutes before.” However, only in training, since best times do not count.
Million-dollar march: Egyptians gear up for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. In central Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in past days, the police had stepped up their street checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for messages and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They targeted the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not taken place in Egypt in years. The Egyptian contractor living in exile in Spain and actor Mohammed Ali, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million march" in central places in the country for today Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution." The man is not a "good guy for most young Egyptians, because he made millions for the army as a subcontractor, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. At first, these figures could not be independently confirmed. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time,'" HRW said, citing lawyers. The allegations against those arrested, according to their lawyers, range from "proliferation of misinformation" to membership in a "terrorist association." In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, also arbitrarily questioned and searched passers-by, according to HRW data.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. The government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, explained the Ministry to a question of the Greens parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - subsequently ended up in the trash. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the tax authorities evaluate in-kind donations such as a turnover, which then generates sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate non-sellable products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online retail, but also to other shops from the fashion store to the hardware store.
Banksy art to the auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work "underlines the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it on 3. October is to be auctioned. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29. March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament."
The picture could change hands for a million dollars.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard exchange of blows with the opposition on Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons after a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants Brexit, which has already been postponed twice, on 31. October if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who, with a chisel, breaks a star of the European flag. The plant is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a 'walk in the park'
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. "We enjoy that. We will leave the EU and we will win.”
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of "betrayal" of the people, among other things. Accusations that he could put MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats, he dismissed as a "humbug."
Cummings said the only way to get calm back is if MEPs would finally respect the British people's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has not yet withdrawn from the EU three years after the referendum.
In light of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen, too."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. "If this goes badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations has a responsibility to Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had revoked the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region, thus abruptly increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government is reacting with a hard hand. She has the population shooting with live ammunition, over 2000 arrested in the prisons join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get to grips with, no matter how hard it goes against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, one in three people in Egypt live below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, with inflation at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression, but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and more. That was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months it was checked whether the complicated system braid in the BER fire protection works in interaction. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not finished at the BER yet.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said there were still shortcomings to be worked off in the terminal. "We have a lot of detail topics, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done on the processing of the defects," it said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport chief expects this to be in place by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoke aprons that shut down like a canvas in a fire so the smoke doesn't spread. They're driving down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen since construction began in 2006 from two billion to expected around 6.5 billion euros to open next year.
Because passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, those in charge are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, it should be in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18. October goes, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, with Human Resources Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put airport finances on firm footing.
Chemnitz: Automaten for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up several machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply. There was a million dollar damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation because of the causing of explosive explosions in crime unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which was led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the loot, he apparently financed his narcotics dependence". Four times alone, the bomber had between 20. August 2018 and 31. May 2019 Parking ticket machines on the Bürgerstraße blown up.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody. Police investigations against him are ongoing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automaton blasts in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is implementing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," an Austrian Airlines press officer confirmed to the APA on Friday. Previously, AviationNetOnline had reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over this in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Deutschland.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson explained. Flight times are to be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device, would be operated. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war has broken out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's battle announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time, AUA board member Andreas Otto said on Friday: "We remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: In the Italian holidays in early month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31). The palace announced this on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married," the couple, who have been dating since October 2018, said in the official release.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29) - and also posted on her Instagram account.
A royal party
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big celebration as the wedding ceremony of Eugenie on 12. October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the main factors of influence for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences was insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to be possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations, according to the hospital. About 200 would be added each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also benefit from the research of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between the heart and the brain, the heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data to research other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. As a justification for his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on and very gratefully in Hamburg three years ago.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. In the case of genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
A human's genetic material can now be decrypted within 24 hours, according to the UKE. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to take place on 1. October begin, already at the end of 2020 all 9000 samples are to be analyzed. The following year, the first results are expected.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. After indications from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially still minor victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said they had been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held on the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers in "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained to a small room.
The Koran school has existed for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities at the facility. The parents had shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They would have known nothing of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koranic schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region are suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Police officers have freed nearly 400 pupils from horrific conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children had been discovered on Thursday after a tip-off in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humanly unworthy." Officers arrested the principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept like slaves at their school and put on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a recognizably poor state of health.
World footballer's choice: More allegations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Football 'signature not valid'
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world footballer's election, accusations come to Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not scored at all - with a curious justification.
Much of Fifa has proved to be infamous in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa world footballer's election has so far not been suspected of running off unclean - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to sympathy rather than objectively.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available vote overview.
Fifa apologizes in that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid." The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally scored: with Lionel Messi at number one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Accusations had also been made by Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my voice are false, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Federation simply voted on his behalf.
From the association came on Friday now the message: True, but of course was not an intention. The completed election documents were "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, the association said in a statement. But the second captain, Manuel Rosas, actually voted. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," the statement said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte, however, had voted for Messi, "as it says in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases have FIFA now examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer's choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Senior Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation into the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, few have made unease about it. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. In the process, the moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policies, such as the easing of environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. “The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it.”
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally have no say in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Still, the first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." U.S. media also report that the first cracks between the Republicans were occurring internally.
The affair could lead to the initiation of impeachment against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefits.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment trial. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could strain a so-called impeachment. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, came in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore slim. So far, no U.S. president has been removed from office through an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are alleged to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she illegally approached the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - their house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious allegations against Rackete are being made. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the Sea-Watch 3. The suspects have been arrested at a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but do not have any reliable information on this itself," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It is Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid agencies now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy's right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk seeks Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog "Electrek."
Demand is strong, so Tesla could place 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said. The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla would have to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-figure figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget dispute: Again, only a bridge financing
The new financial year will be in the US on 1. Start October without a decent budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has transitional funding until the 21st November decided.
Although American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, the United States faces the one on the 1st. October begins new fiscal year once again without spending plans. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21. November decided. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred at midnight on Monday, a partial closure of the federal government. President Trump has yet to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the Federal Administration cannot, for the time being, from 1.3 organic to 1.4 organic for the new financial year. $ extended spending framework benefits.
Democrats have completed ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. The spending laws, however, reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less willing ten of the twelve spending plans that are barely majority-capable.
The spirits differ mainly on the topic of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to 12 billion. $ for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's big priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the wall, the spirits differ
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding over the 21st November out. A shutdown is not excluded either.
Against the backdrop of Congress's continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the accompanying threat of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Template S. In 1877, in order to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Administration would automatically continue at the previous year’s level, prevent the travel activity of the parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual expenditure plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination should also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill, according to which all women can claim in vitro fertilization. This is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The bill still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that numerous "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops’ Conference is also opposed to innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defended Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial insemination for all women is to be borne by the social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still banned
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that should give widows access to their dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem." In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain for the surrender of the sperm of a deceased person. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a child then bears a "particularly difficult fate."
Numerous MPs from the ruling La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and MPs of the opposition had spoken out against it in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the late partner. They stressed that a widow would be given a "double grief" if her desire to have children remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot father children. You must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: Calls for flight tax for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. That is why the country intends to have a climate levy paid there in the future. The principals say they don't have money for it. But now they are also coming under internal pressure.
Universities should also be restricted in flying. Photograph: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is getting going again. After the state rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a university of education advocate compensation for service flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it said in their opinion. The cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fisherman again
According to the FSB intelligence service, those arrested were said to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At the time, there was an exchange of gunfire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the coast guard of Russia is driving patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, according to the information, three fishing and two motorboats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans even after lawsuits by domestic entrepreneurs this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgy Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage from North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-knit synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future, only 18,000: US lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives at the White House.
The richest country on earth is isolated from those seeking protection: As State Department in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal influx of refugees is further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, the U.S. State Department said. In the almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has dramatically lowered the willingness to accept protection seekers from around the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's predecessor administration, far higher admission limits had applied.
The targeted cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee programme was introduced in 1980. The State Department nevertheless described the U.S. as "the most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase that strongly recalls the incumbent president's use of language.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing the refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction there, Trump explained. For his tough course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Zelensky affair and a potentially looming impeachment trial.
According to the Foreign Office, the U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have thus been in danger, according to the State Department statement. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The U.S. wants people in particular to apply for asylum in this "northern triangle" of Central America in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration on the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a reception station for great apes in the US at the request of the Argentine justice system. Born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, the "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person", which is why their release was mandatory. The animal was taken to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilogram human emphet is not able to adapt to life in the wild, it should live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles," formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to endure a roughly 40-day quarantine at Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The trial of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational institution to preserve biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Hussar ride on the almost 3000 meter high grand battlement in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double bottom or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-meter-high north wall of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom from vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. In doing so, he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant increase in profits despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (nearly 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
Revenues rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period to the end of August. Nike sales rose most sharply in China with an increase of 22 percent. In this way, the Beaverton-based group in the US state of Oregon also benefited from its approach in the People’s Republic of its approach of addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures - the sporting goods maker's shares rose more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban over racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifetime stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus, who is from Brazil, had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter should never again attend a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa president Gianni Infantino had said at the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants at the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin recently. Italian authorities have now imposed stadium bans on 38 rioting fans of record champions Juventus Turin. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, police said. For the rest, therefore, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had started the investigation with a complaint last year.
The ultra-leaders are said to be behind the black trade with tickets, according to Italian media reports. They would have "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get to cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are covered with gripping designations. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitude to life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With that call started on 21. September officially the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, with which the opening event of the 19. China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was ushered in, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started raising crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a formative industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as a technology-supported crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimization of administration and government services," and built with care the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending." In this way, the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local advantages through the connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as figureheads to provide intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, and companies for organic agriculture, which are leading in the "3+2" sector At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone covering all areas and of tourist resorts of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape were integrated, the state of the buildings for civil services and public service were comprehensively improved, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" were vigorously further developed and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level was advanced. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-U.S. conflict: Rouhani speaks of end to sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken of an alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions after his return from the U.N. General Assembly. The United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, would have promised an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on its official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the events as follows: The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had urged that a meeting take place. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," Rouhani added. The nature of the punitive measures that should be ended was up for debate. "And they have clearly said, we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this push was not in an acceptable way, criticized Rouhani. In view of the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, had expressed hope that Rouhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Major earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftersheaks
After Western Turkey was rocked by two earthquakes within a very short time, fears of disaster are growing. 34 people were injured in Tuesday's earthquake. Since the quake the previous day, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Friday. This raises concern about disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake had rocked the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, weary made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which were registered as refuges in the center, have long been built. First, 20. Anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the quake of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at about seven kilometers depth, as the civil protection agency Afad announced. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not initially been reported. State broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for safety reasons. Some students were crying, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the quake near Istanbul in 1999. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that a magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 earthquake could threaten. But when the earthquake will occur is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies draft contingency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said eight people were injured after returning from New York. Some buildings would have suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning of aftershoes in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
The date of the quake is indicated by 13:59 (local time) according to official data. Just minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock, according to CNN Turkey, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions, the disaster protection agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be an advance warning now. It was more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later, the big quake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake also sparked great worries in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also quaked on Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment trial, the US Democrats are encouraged: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president hold important indications for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt." He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight has been diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
At an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday night (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be freed from the narrow cabin. She had been locked up in it for about an hour, US media wrote, citing other passengers. For the onward flight towards San Francisco, passengers had to change the plane.
In a video circulated on the Internet, which is said to come from Flight 1554, according to US media, can be seen how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're working on opening the door at the moment, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative "The Transformation," the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published on 27 December. November in German, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams" who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to let nothing and no one stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers, in high positions, beg the catastrophe of a no-deal downright - then a writer must wonder what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write.” The novel "Machines like me" about artificial intelligence was published by McEwan only in the spring.
Kafka's 1915 first published narrative is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a tremendous vermin," is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," Diogenes Verlag said.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are getting whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail links between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel cancelled until 31 October
German tour operator Thomas Cook has all travel up to and including 31. Cancelled October 2019. Travel could "not be started for insolvency reasons," the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin brands, which have already been paid or paid in full. How to Travel with Start from 1. November 2019 stands, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the pull of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels again from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, should receive money from the Zurich insurance company. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman told the German Press Agency. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are not asked to pay or otherwise coerced from these hotels from now on," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their local accommodation themselves. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to data from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the way. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts of hotels by the Zurich Insurance only help the travelers who are currently still on the road. Things are looking bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to go on holiday. Late Thursday night, the company said all travel up to and including 31. October would be canceled. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
How to Travel with Start from 1. November 2019 stands, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out about the possibilities of refunding the travel price on the Kaera website and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosives mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, Britain's Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed a explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circle in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosives master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she was walking at the time. The pictures, on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997, had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stalled Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly decided: With him, there is guaranteed not to be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are of eternal duration in the polarizing British. The UK's recent ruling hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blonde head. His suspension of parliament to be able to stubbornly carry out his Brexit course by the exit date was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by parliament obliges Johnson to do so, in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31. October to bring about an extension of the bilateral talks. However, Johnson had categorically ruled that out again and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
Yet the pressure doesn't seem to be palpably over with Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he suggested that in the event of a non-agreement, he supported an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU at 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is gradually running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have around six weeks to prevent a UK exit from the European Union without a deal. But even the recent talks have not made a breakthrough again. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. She fears Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US agency: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injured in this context, said the U.S. health agency CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 people affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the US.
Fears of new protests in Egypt are growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times on online networks. The Spanish-based contractor and actor is calling for a "people's revolution" in it. For today Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass rallies with a million attendees in central squares in the country.
The security agencies are alarmed. An increased police presence has already been observed in central Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in the past few days, the police had stepped up their street checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly on messages and photos in connection with the protests.
On 20. In September, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt in years. The security forces reacted accordingly harshly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW said, citing lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. According to the report, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially convicted in recent years.
'Ocean Change': Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the Port of Hamburg, he was greeted by, among other things, the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar explorer said. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. We have known for decades that the earth is warming. Many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place to the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenlandic glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "Fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. “He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades.”
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, demanded, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday's edition).
Promptly came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese would not only have ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be found in the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, said the innkeeper.
A call in Ukraine, and everything's broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face impeachment after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and the US democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: The president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He had exploited the dependence of Ukraine in the process blackmailed and thus forced it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be understood in the now published communication with Zelensky, although it does not reproduce the full text. The phone call of 25. July, however, is just one episode of a much larger story, centered next to Trump, is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports from Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the just elected President Zelenskyy, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation, which is what we have the right to do," he tells the newspaper. You might think it was inappropriate, but “there’s nothing illegal about that.” Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor appears to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is about exactly the investigation that Trump will talk to Zelensky on the phone in July. The version of Giuliani and the president reads: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine commissioner of the Obama administration, has pushed for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin. This is to stop the investigation he was responsible for by the gas company on whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was on. Biden senior has slapped Ukraine financially to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was slightly different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general go, the investigation into the gas company was already complete, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by this. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the U.S. government was far from the only Western partner to push for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation into the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp disruptions: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded since about 15.30 clock again and again. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also appears to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. More often affected by disturbances
It's not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been out for several hours. And as in previous cases, users are also resorting to Twitter this time in particular to make their anger air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling by dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - it took less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, at just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes more spàter we were above the inflatable boat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely taken back to their research station.
Attention: NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn of wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, however, the researchers have always measured above 30 degrees even with the perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only rebounds in capacity, but it also does not last so long overall. The service life is therefore lower. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since battery replacement is always associated with high costs for modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of a battery replacement even again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and arduous plug fumble. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which, for once, even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has made international headlines before: From him comes a photo of mountaineers who went viral in the spring, who are queuing on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass crowd sparked a debate about stronger security measures on Earth's 8848-metre-high mountain and highest peaks. In May, eleven climbers had died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14. Eight-thousanders: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is, among other things, bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
There are estimated to be only about 7,000 elephants in Sri Lanka. In theory, the death penalty is on her killing.
Deadly British oil tanker leaves Iran
British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was arrested by Iran. This was announced by the seafaring office Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the British-flagged tanker on the 19th. July, under the accusation of having violated regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to comprehensively investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is supposed to be about the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not want to financially join the struggling company. "Our interest is in the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors," said committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves in London. "Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of the genes in the familially increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits are therefore likely to be more severe than previously thought. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares go up
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek." The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it said in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla would have to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-figure figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered over whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law against an unregulated Brexit, which was last passed by parliament. When asked about this, he said on Friday in front of journalists only that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday had expressed the presumption that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will be on 31. To leave October, and the best way is with an agreement.”
Iran apparently ramps up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has stepped up pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states show ineptitude or unwillingness when it comes to concrete action," Rouhani said Thursday at a news conference on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. In the event that they were not among their promises, he put "further steps" away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The U.S. single-handedly stepped out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in Middle East policy deemed aggressive. The administration of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now counting on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by restarting the uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium, or at least prepared them for use. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. But there will still be further talks, which will hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed the attack, but this was considered a false commitment by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rouhani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such allegations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders could not have done that in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have only invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would first have to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to pivot to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of other star thwarts solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was achieved beforehand. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused interest from astronomers around the world.
The well-traveled comet was on 30. August was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-ups of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be sighted during a flight of our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain insight into an alien solar system from nearby before disappearing again and again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical velocities of objects orbiting the sun," Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. space agency Nasa reported in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is traveling on a so-called hyperbole railway, which leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. She is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which had initially been listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was designated 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object to have been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are in luck: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in the approach. So the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be possible to observe with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers in an initial investigation. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets of our solar system, and that indicates that their composition must be similar," IAC researcher Julia de León reported. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed by processes similar to those in ours, added de León’s colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new path to the exploration of certain processes in other solar systems. How often such visits are, however, is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could potentially intercept a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet interceptors) by 2028 on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, she should either lurk on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport, Daxing
Just in time for the 70. The birthday of the People’s Republic is the time: A first passenger plane of the China United Airlines has landed on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled at the new airport annually, and in 2025, there will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's latest prestige project is also called the "starfish" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-New Subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 and is much smaller, has so far been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: From London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the UK Space Agency is dreaming of. This flight, which is planned for the 2030s, is to make a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire develops, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying. "That's the technology that could definitely accomplish that," agency chief Graham Turnock told the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
To drive the project forward, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris line from 1976 until the discontinuation of its operation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the start of a Concorde at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, which killed all 109 occupants. Last year, U.S. aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to work with the U.S. space agency Nasa to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane." Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with his high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable frame devices".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told U.S. envoys to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past one had dealt with such "a little differently" than today.
This was seen as an attempt at intimidation against typists. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media outlets circulated audio recordings from the address on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Due to great public pressure, the descriptions of the whistleblower had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the US president "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about previous business dealings of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: leading government employees had made an effort to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was drawn up. After the conversation, however, this was removed from a database usually provided for this purpose on the instructions of lawyers from the White House and was instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Trump again questioned the source's credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may not be any tipsters or spies.
As Trump expressed in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower, but sparked outrage. U.S. House of Representatives Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmed and complained that Trump’s testimony once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been going on in various committees for months. In the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with renewed force to set in motion a possible impeachment trial against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly berates Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sphere, who mostly worked under Democratic but also among Republican presidents, backed the Democrats' investigation for possible impeachment in a statement released on Friday. Should the allegations come true, it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could indeed pursue a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, came in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore slim. So far, no U.S. president has been removed from office through an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: Jobs are being cut 'sneakingly'
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the carmaker's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of these, 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to this is the personnel costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a workplace can only be cut at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment protection applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are actually not to disposition, are "sneakingly" dismantled via a different path - i.e. past the official course. Thus, vacant regular positions would often not be refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the reoccupation. Meanwhile, in many places, personnel are missing, the work compaction is increasing, the worries about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment is as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and centrally manage new projects. This should also reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann, CEO of production, said at a managerial conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
There are already successes in this way: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Speaking to reporters, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, the one on the 24th, was set to happen. October in Wolfsburg is to be presented, shortened by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production period, according to information from our newspaper, it is round at the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg headquarters is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems in the conversion to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test method.
As production board member Tostmann announced last year, however, "perspectively" one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg. This is to make the bundling of golf production in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant is handing over the golf production by retrofitting to the site for electric car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of the Gulf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, he is to remain the Wolfsburg bread-and-butter car for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: Trafficker sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn with oaths, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerians who wanted to leave had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were taken across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wages were therefore completely paid to them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the injection and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to deal with," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the sentencing hearing. "Some were really disgusted."
The verdicts are on commercial and gang-like injection of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
The flight attendants’ union UFO has once again threatened strikes with the Lufthansa Group in the permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "on 14. Inform October about the industrial action measures in the LH Group," said UFO tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been rejecting collective bargaining with UFO for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, UFO now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the labour court Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to determine that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court dismissed the motions. The company confirmed the decision and considered appealing against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think is unlikely," UFO board member Flohr said.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurt Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union has not appointed a board member for months and is therefore not in a position to fill its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, in the course of which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board have resigned, including the long-time union boss Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended an already begun vote on strikes of the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about its leadership.
Ease entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But that is about to change now. The Persian Gulf country wants to introduce new visa requirements.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors will be increased to 100 million per year, the tourism commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the orch-conservative kingdom is hoping for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik, as well as the Churais oil field. Following this, national oil production collapsed dramatically, oil price projectiles soaring. It is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed suits on Instagram, asking his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple want to get married next weekend.
The Biebers said yes at a New York registry office a year ago. There had been no bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue recently, Hailey explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two killed in Czech Republic plane crash
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a wooded area near the city of Mecin, police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday night after the crew issued a distress signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are in danger of extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all the 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 would already be at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered," "highly endangered," "endangered" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct." In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide than endangered.
Eberesche and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, mainly Ebereschen (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. “Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by converting or weakening their habitats.”
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat, in addition to a mushroom, is the Balkan minier moth. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks and avenues are not taken into account in this assessment.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously produced new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and nearly half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make protecting these species a priority."
Istanbul earthquake: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths, according to the data. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake had shaken the region around Istanbul. Authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform on the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It's not getting any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of himself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On the 2. February 2020 will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the halftime show. “Now it’s even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I’m going to perform with another Latina.” She can’t wait to “show what we girls can do on the world’s biggest stage.”
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages worldwide, representing Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two "queens" have been on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and halftime show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the US. Even if you've dropped audiences last: This February, the spectacle in the U.S. attracted the fewest spectators in more than ten years. Still, there were still nearly a hundred million people on average.
There had been a turmoil about the halftime show of the past Super Bowl in advance: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform last February. Eventually, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick sparked a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been clubless since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to cost the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There are threats of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the Financial Times in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to pay off overall write-downs of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (around 2 billion on their books. Euro), according to the report. This would have been shown by estimates of the consulting company AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to write down from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million. Buy pounds. The amounts actually to be written off are more likely to come to the upper end of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will become apparent after the insolvency proceedings have expired. A person close to this procedure did not exude too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s approximately 40 aircraft in the UK are “old” and many of the properties are in poor locations. The most money could probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it said.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but do not have any secure information on this itself," the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, told the dpa news agency.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had on 29. June illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa and rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are said to have arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government over Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network equipment supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the Handelsblatt newspaper in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that requires every company "under Chinese case law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such inquiries," the FCC chief said. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has meanwhile agreed to require suppliers to have a "declaration of trust."
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not just made of hardware:
The software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to track down security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company, which supposedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
The U.S. has evidence that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to advocate for the US position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, the responsible prefecture said. The Interior Ministry had urged citizens to stay in buildings as much as possible and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals indoors, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that smell will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were on duty at the scene of the fire.
A gigantic column of black smoke had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol company's factory, which makes additives for oils. The production facility is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The Normandy factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored, according to authorities. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian town of Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told BFMTV news channel it had initially not been found to have "high toxicity" in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine cannot be ruled out. In the river, dams against the pollution were built, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at about 02.40, authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French finance minister: "Germany must invest and now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investment to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Action would have to be those states that would have budgetary leeway for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, citing his country's high public debt. This is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced," Le Maire said.
In recent years, appeals have repeatedly come from France to Germany to make more public investment in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to get a grip on its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, unveiled on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vest Movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson dodges question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the "Capitulation Act" passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. But critics fear Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician dodges.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered over whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is intended to prevent exactly that. When asked, Johnson told reporters only that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday had expressed the presumption that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will be on 31. To leave October, and the best way is with an agreement.”
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, declared that he perceives the political disputes over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and expressed confidence that the desired EU exit will still come about: "We enjoy this, we will win, we will (note d. Red.: leaving the EU), don't worry," Cummings told the British newspaper Telegraph at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the chief strategist at the British government headquarters in Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Premier into an almost hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Pockets) delves deep into the McCartney family's all-private world.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrious guests also included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made them, a few hundred of which are now first published in "The Polaroid Diaries."
It is portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s until the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," art critic Ekow Eshun writes in his foreword. And of course, there is always one in the center: Her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland, they also lived a normal life. So Mary McCartney said, according to the BBC, that she had slept in a bed as a baby that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it hasn't always been tidy with the McCartneys either.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The shots of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It’s about the decision click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," Paul McCartney said. “If you take two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the ability to always capture just the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the picture section and the colors are right, which not only makes "The Polaroid Diaries" an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but is also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes also sometimes look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the recently reissued Beatles album "Abbey Road," which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighboring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cut off oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of the US threats."
Even so, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The U.S. has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" toward the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear deal with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the slump in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
U.S. government seeks to restrict admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to dramatically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said the U.S. would continue to be committed to supporting refugees. The most important task, however, is to protect and serve US citizens. The U.S. immigration system is currently overburdened.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State Department statement. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number stood at just under 85,000.
Aid agencies reacted in horror to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," International Rescue Committee chief David Miliband said. The U.S. would thus continue to damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - legally as well as illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Comes close to a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has given appropriate guidance to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a snitch," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event Thursday in New York. Several US media outlets report this in agreement.
Trump spoke in front of employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events at the White House, he replied: "This comes close to a snitch." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little bit differently than we do now."
Observers assessed the latter remark on a possible reference to the death penalty. Democrats drew sharp criticism for Trump's remarks and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It is also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment against him, wrote the chairmen of the committees for foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-released complaint of having abused his office to solicit interference by another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested to him to initiate investigations against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
People repeatedly try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The often too small boats regularly capsize. In the sinking of a rubber boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants have died in the sinking of a rubber boat. Among the fatalities were a baby as well as four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods of the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a smuggler, Chios' local news portal, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Which countries the migrants come from is not yet known. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who cancel concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of an ailment of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of Wednesday night's performance (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it while it's still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology, adding that Daltrey "can't really speak now." Townsend promised the audience to get their money's worth at a reparation concert. A date has not yet been set.
Performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver canceled The Who. They are due to be made up for at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly discontinued: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company had sold founder Adam Neumann as boss a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British Financial Times reports, among other things, that WeWork has stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect. In New York and London, among others, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office space for the long term and rents it out to members in some small units at short notice. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company posted a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs due to the rental of ever new large areas are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the renting of new land with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in obligations of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork, one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets, has rented nearly 300,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new land on the market during this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have risen during that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider." The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, which was bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet WeWork's requirements with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a part of the hoped-for billions in revenue. They do not have access to WeWork's - already scarce - reserves despite the long-term leases. This is because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coast guard has again cracked down on North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of a further 262 poachers have been arrested who have illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shelled and three of them injured. There were no casualties this time, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the coast guard of Russia is driving patrols to protect its marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, according to the information, three fishing and two motorboats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans even after lawsuits by local entrepreneurs this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there at times in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgy Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage from North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-knit synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. The ships themselves also do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian coast guard were injured in the previous week's arrests, according to Moscow. A likewise wounded North Korean later died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On that 17. In September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
U.S. imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department justified that in a statement Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he is head of a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued travel bans against members of the Venezuelan government and the military, among others. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The U.S. has imposed a whole host of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the U.S. and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time difference before the protests over Europe drag on to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Protesters also wanted to gather outside the White House in Washington.
How big the worldwide support will be this Friday after the record turnout of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we'll do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the influx last Friday was very large. A good third of all global protesters - around 1.4 million - had taken part in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had put himself in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has resulted in the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests are mainly attended by pupils and students, but increasingly also by scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global heating and the threat of climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained to below 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week transatlantic trip with a high-seas racing yacht. There, she had most recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke urgently into the conscience of the world's leaders. In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This envisages a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," an emergency ministry spokesman told the agency Tass in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is scheduled to be on 1. October comes into effect.
Those who still smoke must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Blow to cybercriminals - Investigators excavate servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time dug up a large server provider for illegal business on the dark web.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Attorney General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested during a major action on Thursday night. The darknet is a shielded part of the internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second-largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market" - which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to the attorney general's office.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access operation with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighboring countries. She was the result of nearly five years of investigation. At noon, investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg plans to attend a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21. Century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in front of the power people of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and leads young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne felt chosen to advocate for a more just world. At that time, he was also able to win over a number of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently embarked on the trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even tried-and-true followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the journey by boat was probably also set up too much for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own in the media worldwide very well and a lot of money flows thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now divided: is it morally right to enrich yourself financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects from certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is currently thwarting our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently thwarting our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently thwarting our solar system. He was christened 2I/Borisov after his discoverer and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of its kind to be spotted while passing through.
The great opportunity for astronomers now is to catch glimpses of an alien solar system from close range. Apparently, the Come is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is of a clear interstellar origin and is currently operating on a so-called hyperbolar, which leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers can observe it in depth. Because unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in his approach, which means that he can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be possible to observe with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The new visitor's predecessor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems similar to our comet - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed by processes similar to those in ours, added de León’s colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to study certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely reprehensible': Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is getting more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges the warlike language of the prime minister as "tasteless" with clear words. It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation," "fraud," treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to upgrade - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender, as if opponents of an EU exit should be "hung, long-drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She thinks this is extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who had run for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK" in the elections to the EU parliament.
She was particularly struck by the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly lower house MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their memory can best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to an MP who was murdered by someone who shouted 'Britain first'," Johnson's sister said. The perpetrator apparently came from the far-right camp, which felt "reconciled by this kind of language." For those who mourned for them, it would be very distasteful.
Cox's widower also sharply criticised the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to stand up passionately and decisively for what you believe in, no matter what you think you are. But never should we “demonize the other side.” He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned from his post as secretary of state and his mandate as a Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to family and national interest in recent months - it is an indissoluble tension," Johnson said.
Johnson's language also faced sharp criticism in the church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country." In a joint statement, they said: "In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should talk to each other with respect.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is making a strong mark in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform Latino roots. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I am incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo. Because this one has an incredible strength in the U.S.," Shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will be its 100 next year. Birthday celebrates, finds on 2. February in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be in German cinemas in the drama "Hustlers" from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever."
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US each time. This year, many also consider the selection to be a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policies.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million TV viewers watch the NFL finals, it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
There was political controversy in the run-up to the year. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up while playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against black people and had been harshly approached by US President Donald Trump, among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had turned down a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 performed was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber puts Egypt's ruler at risk: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who have influence over whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt, have spent the past week both abroad. One of them floated back into Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 deposed Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's crackdown on political Islam and not lost a syllable over the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. He has "no reason to worry," Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians are not misled."
Misleading - that, according to the president, the other man who is currently determining what is happening on the streets is trying to do. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he evaded the grip of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-pointing voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea rooms: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets," Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president is reveling in luxury and let himself be built magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi props up his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen in his second profession as a contractor for 15 years, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that's the impression of many Egyptians, as the downright skyrocketing click numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisi’s grip on power last week, and nearly 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a “million march” for this Friday. That so many people would really venture onto the streets was unlikely. But there were occasional smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanding his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be independently verified at first. Security sources said police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the outage roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed because of "maintenance work," most of the roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim brother Morsi entrenched themselves in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was intended to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a large rally for the president here of all people.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not clash with police officers." But this is not to be understood as a retreat: "All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. In the event of abnormalities, customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transmission rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be reached, explains the consumer center Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. For example, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," the consumer center Bavaria points out on its side.
If the connection is much slower than advertised, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of 14 days to produce the promised service. Those affected do this best in writing by letter of insert.
If this does not cause anything even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim compensation. But if there is no success, only the legal route will help.
First senior Republican for inquiry
As the first senior Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken out in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established," Phil Scott said at a news conference Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president - are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Because Trump is observing Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have made unease about it. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump's policies several times, such as the easing of environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man to stay in MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was unclear how the films about Tom Holland would continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home." Several US media outlets report this in agreement. According to the theatrical release is already clear: In the USA, the film is to be from 16. July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant," Marvel boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on its Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring.”
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney, which includes Marvel, would contribute 30 percent of the revenues of incoming Spider-Man movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
That's how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the 'Suits' finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who played in the series for many years, were also paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing first: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives once again featured the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she greets him after his suspended prison sentence.
Yet even her real husband, Prince Harry, was casually mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight towards the altar to marry his fiancee Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark regarding his suit. Whether he actually threw himself a coat, the surprised Harvey wants to know from the groom, only to then snippish: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
When capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, the Greek coast guard announced on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he intends to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU commissioner, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about what the refugee situation is like," Seehofer said on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help cope.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip on Friday with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants continue to arrive from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, the Greek civil protection ministry said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased figures recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is progressing only laboriously on the Greek side due to a lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are waiting for almost 29 400 people, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5200 migrants are currently housed.
Never since the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact came into force in March 2016 have there been so many, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "quite certainly" one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and increasingly led to heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, the elderly and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Party leader holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has gone unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Green Party, never held the reusable coffee cup with a metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was featured in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and also distributed to the media - and the cup was still a sniffy (cardboard) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Greens leader has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post subsequently accused May of manipulation and that the party was producing fake news to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection." And this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and spurred the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and said on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, she said correctly was made of bamboo. She always has him with her. A spokeswoman for the party said it was only a matter of putting the party logo in the picture, and not about covering up anything. Only one snippet of the photo can be seen on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, and asked herself something from her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, could they not do something with my face, so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of single-use plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoon on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was allegedly assured of an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for business class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from economy class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng is followed by more than 65,000 users. On 30. It is May from Taiwan to New York and on 7. June flown back.
On the outbound flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, despite showing a mail in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter is said to have been received by the influencer from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they checked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail allegedly came is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
Airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Because Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline doesn't want to settle for that - and is now turning on a lawyer.
Oil prices give in after Yemen ceasefire report
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday noon within a very short time. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the price slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone strike on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production to a halt in mid-September. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war-torn country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually come about, one could focus on growth and demand worries, Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank told the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are thus continuing their downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost up to nearly 59 dollars, Brent nearly 65 dollars.
Most recently, Bloomberg had reported, citing insiders, that repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than thought after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases, citing insiders, who report on rapid progress of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping company chief Erik Hånell told Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Britain had at times significantly driven up oil prices in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late July. This was stated by an anonymous whistleblower. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The sense and chances of success of such a meeting are questionable because of a lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the resolutions of the summit the previous year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said. He also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea. But he hopes for a "wise" and "brave" decision by Trump, so that it comes again to a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, they met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. In doing so, they agreed to revive the consultations, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Gun makers to help with mine clearance
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, Britain's Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically detonated and destroyed a explosive mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded. With regard to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to get rid of them to commit to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation on an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is adding to the pound sterling. The British currency edged up as much as 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars on Friday.
The sales were triggered by remarks by the central banker Michael Saunders. This brought an interest rate cut into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, since the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, since Saunders is considered a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokerage ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the strains on the economy caused by the Brexit hickhack without directly signalling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants his country even without a divorce agreement at 31 if necessary October lead from the EU.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Athletics Championships, new details of the doping scandal in Russia come to the fore - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even partially. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). It turned out they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sport. The Wada had blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes in the country competing under a neutral flag, and 168 Russian athletes competed at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to attend the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup with the host took place in Russia as a participant.
Lack of positive findings
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yeah. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," David Howman told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in an interview on Friday. “We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data that Wada received from a whistleblower and the ones she received from the Russians in January.” Many positive findings were missing, which had been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the IAAF's stance: The Athletics Federation is the only organization to hold on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
Earlier this week, Wada had already put manipulations in the room, urging Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed suspension of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
