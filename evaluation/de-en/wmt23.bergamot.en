Diego Cocca becomes new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico is hosting the World Cup with the World Cup for the first time with their first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not one of the favourites for the post. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed bead should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) place the plant signs in the flowers of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht flowers" also includes information about what is blooming there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an action by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centres, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought to the ground since 2015. Objective: In the Geesthacht urban area, bloom islands are to be created on a wide scale, on which insects find food at all times. "In favourable weather conditions, the bees will fly out in January to seek food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthachter Nabu. He has himself hives on the property.
To ensure that the endeavour not only remains an action of conservationists and the city's specialist service environment, but also draws wide circles right into the private gardens, explanatory tables are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to inform themselves what is blooming here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will plant specifically at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the Wildhasel
Younger date are bushes such as winter devil cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the ground of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaving, and have recently been covered with further signs. "The winter devilk cherry is a very broadly bushy shrub and can be between two metres high and three metres wide," read there under further information on the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bedding plants now show flowers. In the first week of January, the season was already the start of the Wildhasel. It flowers particularly sufficiently on the direction of the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them if he looked down from the sky to the Munich Ostbahnhof train station!
Every day on Mondays three women meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at a little bit of tap dance - together they are an unbelievable 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102. Birthday.
For the native of Munich (15. January 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh" is the Montag DER highlight of the week. "Dancing and steppes is my life, without me I can't imagine."
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dance legs with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would be told to musical actress, collaborated with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life with dancing, actors and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the round of tap dancers. She says: "We simply have fun with our dance teacher Sissy Engl here".
Wikipedia: The tap dance was founded in the 19th century. developed in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wood soles first used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created during dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is accordingly Tap dance and the French Claquettes. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they create a well-audible tone while dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Your advice to all: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With increasing digitalization, some people are growing the desire for analogue
The speed with which our everyday life became digital hardly allowed us to set up rules for dealing with it and adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either one belonged to the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or one belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make phone calls for a bottle of Radeberger with the relatives. Or you were looking for a telephone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic listener and the clicking of the coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other's face when calling - picture telephony, I thought what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 Days for a New Government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has commissioned former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to achieve this. Recean has been one of the president's advisers so far.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as it itself announced as an explanation for its resignation - apparently it was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for their "enorm victims".
Moldova is a neighbouring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken up tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (action and solidarity party) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, because it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and its cabinet is therefore not a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian - with the support of the Kremlin - have become more popular.

Oberhof: Kühn Achter in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive show despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to close to his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, which is there as a TV expert, is still undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even some strong fog did not prevent permanent winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the race pedal. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay was already successfully defending the title.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the hunting race number three will follow. In the persecution, Bö is once again the clear favorite. Its running shape is outstanding, so that it can easily compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, nothing went together with Doll. After the experienced team had awarded all the chances of a medal to kick with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there had only been sixth place, things did not go better three days later. Three penalties already in recumbent shooting and two others were a great disappointment for the elder in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he surprisingly won with 0.7 seconds advantage in sight of Bon. It was one of only three career successes Dolls, who once stood on the podium this winter so far. The Olympic Ashes of Beijing moved away wordlessly after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees finished in 19, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "Musit to stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on the preservation of democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula replied with regard to his right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left politician Lula prevailed in a run-off election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On the 1st Lula took office in January. The change of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital, Brasilia, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a gloomy way reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then President Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," said Lula. "Come on to me," Biden replied - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF search posters? It was viewed by the members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a denunciation culture, which existed before Corona, so publicly suggested mood, against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here with the really dangerous in a pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is otherwise more likely to be found in the S-Bahn or Onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there is a lot of room for pictures in this world, which is part of Asia, Africa and Latin America may include more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, it's not what: in place 1 to 5 (!) is Mrs Wagenknecht, then follows Mrs. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my surroundings who reads this sheet. If only, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing left below.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Mrs Wagenknecht should not yet be the most popular politician of all, not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and antimilitarist people. (And here no more differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler submits divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have split up. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser against the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says: "I can confirm that my client has submitted an application to the competent court through his family lawyer to the competent court. I don't say about details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, separation rumours have been around for about a year. After his jungle camp participation, the fashion designer is said to have moved to Berlin from the joint house in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS-Massakers in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, a memorial centre was established in 1999. A year ago, France's President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the Order of National Merit. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German Peace. The survivor had campaigned for German-French youth meetings, among other things.
A curve position for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ series Northlippic hamlets: In Homeien, three or four generations often live under one roof. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In the summer, 300 motorcycles also roar the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup long - and some are back.
German bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high rate of inflation necessary for "absolute". "The inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also temporarily give prices a boost," said Sewing of "World on Sunday".
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth year and another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 February. March promised. The key interest rate in the euro area now stands at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates more expensive loans. This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates. Higher interest in lending can also lead to investment being postponed and thus economic growth is weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden on highly indebted euro states such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more severe than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we must keep this in mind, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability for the euro area at a rate of two percent inflation in the medium term. This target has been far away for months. Although price increase weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher rates of famine reduce the purchasing power of consumers are reduced, because they can then afford less for one euro. Strongly higher energy prices, which are driving inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse earlier or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Deutschland-Tempo" in infrastructure projects proclaimed by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it might also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out that it does not necessarily have to be as quick as with the LNG terminals that were put into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply a bit due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "Deutschland-Tempo" on the occasion. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes to it. However, this should not automatically mean that we are always acting so categorically from now on and putting a pear bike in the garden for his will," said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process, which as a society is found right and wrong.
In the past, the classic set of rules were tried and not made. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was so right. Perhaps we have also exaggerated it with the set of rules and made it too complicated."
However, in view of the many open tasks involving the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it is."
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
The IG BCE chemical union warns about the dismantling of the Group after an announced change of head at Bayer. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer is in perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future with its three main friends," said Francesco Grioli, member of the board of the union and Bayer Supervisory Board, the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health division with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of industry is only managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk spread and sustainability - and not hedge fund activism."
The background to the head change at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals company announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post later this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to be appointed in early June.
Baumann has long been in criticism. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, which was completed in 2018, is dependent on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen had brought expensive litigation into the house about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. The Bayer share was on a descent for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to give the CEO at the Annual General Meeting discharge.
It has been known for some time that Baumann did not seek an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. They had printed long-term strategic investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also helped to help. According to a media report, Bluebell is increasing to split the group.
The very small fund with unknown amount of investment in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off "the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase shareholder value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post". However, it does not consider the spin-off of the much larger agrarian division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands wanting to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, too, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing the concentrated protest on the streets to a government project. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people across the country are expected again on Saturday to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the centre government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. More than a million people have been taking to the streets twice and there have been national strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. A turbulent debate in parliament has been underway for the controversial reform for a week.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 years, if they have not paid in long enough for a down-decrease free reindeer when they reach the age limit. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, the opponents of the reform mean. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health in the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the workers would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the level of pension stable, the population had to work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money in order to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government does not only want to raise a pension age. The increase in the required deposit period for a full pension decided years ago is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is expected to rise to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered to be one of President Macron's most important projects. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt was stopped to implement the reform, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. A number of presidents before Macron were already trying to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - broad protest and strikes were certain to everyone.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to get the reform through the help of the conservative Républicains announced the support. However, some of the Members - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a tight vote, Macron is probably worried about paralyzing strikes at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they would be quiet and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather awaits - in high altitudes lots of sun
A mighty high pressure area is located above Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm weather is expected to take place at least to midweek. "When viewing the weather maps, a powerful high pressure area immediately catches the eye directly over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "This high shifts a little east over the next week. However, it will continue to be the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather does not necessarily mean sunny weather in winter, says evil. "So a high can even be quite common and give people in the lowlands for days dreary high mist grey, while in the high altitudes of the low mountains there is sun pure."
Thus, Sunday starts in most regions neblig-trüb. According to DWD, it can also rain a bit from the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover rises during the course of the day and the sun is becoming apparent more and more often. In the rest of the country it remains covered with many clouds or fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, then then then then buckled the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, back at the Hochnebel and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day long, elsewhere it must first fight through the Hoch Nebulan ceiling. The highest values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine it is expected by 11 degrees, but only 3 degrees are expected in the continuous grey in the southeast. We have a mild wind from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands there can be only tough resolution of fog or high fog again. Otherwise, the weather shows itself after fog dissolution. According to the forecasts, the sun shines in high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and the Alpine region. The temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin quangers: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The beaten peeful Sofia Goggia has been deeply disappointed after her end in the downhill of the alpine skiing world championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't do the performance I can do," said the Italian woman on ZDF after she had threaded at a goal and had left. After all, the 30-year-old was able to prevent a possibly heavy crash.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. Four of the six season races in this discipline have won them. After Gold 2018 in Pyeongchang, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, which is known for her risky driving style, must wait for a World Championship medal in her leading discipline. At her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was missing due to injury.
"I actually thought I was good at it. After the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France, it was about hundredths of a second," Goggia said. "I am disappointed. I have given it all. But that's how life is." Sometimes you believe things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: "But she is not."

Selenskyj and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the demand for exclusion from Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint telephone conference, they had agreed to draw up a declaration to prevent attempts to send back athletes from Russia and Belarus to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports told on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine lasts," said Minister Jurgita Ziugdinien.
The video consultation was held on the initiative of the United Kingdom. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I have made Britain's position very clearly: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint declaration on this issue".
Prior to this, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other senior representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Selensky. He published his speech in his Telegram Canal. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a war party because the country provides military bases for attacks to Russian troops. Selenskyi called on the officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The occasion of the conference was the announcement of the IOC to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott if the IOC allows athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, said that he had also confirmed the need to refuse to reject a start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris during the discussions. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to be subject to the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The effort of the IOC to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," said a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior on a dpa request.
At the end of January, Home Secretary Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed: "The sport should be clear in condemning the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasises that sport and politics need to be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently declared that there was an exclusion "because of a passport or the birthplace" against the prohibition of discrimination.

Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's tanks heavily decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? USA see Moscow's tank population severely decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. We are talking about the "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tank in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Modefying or confiscated by Ukraine, Celeste Wallander, State Secretary for International Security, said the US Department of Defense, Secretary of State for International Security.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks covered and destroyed by the US-idea at an online event of the Center for a New American Security event.
Ukraine is to be preserved from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The UK has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2-combat tanks for March. In a coalition with other states, Germany wants to deliver a battalion to Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The USA also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, your delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to submit
In response to Western military aid, former Cremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has begged up aircraft, missiles, tanks abroad," said Medvedev, who is now vice-head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
A law has been in force in Russia since last summer, which enables a stronger orientation of the economy to the needs of the army. This means that individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Swirls around cast post in army
The post that Christian Ortner will be held in the future by the former director of the Military History Museum (HGM) was not announced. The personnel representative of the Herwig Jedlaucnik Academy suspects post-corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment to a previously unoccupied job is taking place, said the Minister. She does not want to comment on "Sects by a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of the military past of Austria, he was confronted with severe accusations of bullying. These are cleared out of Tanner's view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability. This is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current questions of security policy.
The SPÖ requires Tanner to clarify the "unusual ordering process". The "appearance of Postenschacher" says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to take back the appointment. The ÖVP is "continuing to the neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defence. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools come to the knees at cost
In a different way, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs are difficult to cope with safety in waters, among other things, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "train of cheerful people" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's greatest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades were cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne holds on to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We are holding our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Clauses. But here, too, the financial concerns are pressing: If more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were even more paid, reserves would have to be hit - "that's not possible every year". The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: There is a price increase of up to 60 percent for the confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fast Night Train Friends' Association. Due to happiness in the accident, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that it will become more expensive. Safety needs twice as many staff as 2020.
If you are on the wayside on the Rhineland on the Rose Monday train, you could get less camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don't have that much with them. Kamelle back or forth, the number of visitors is likely to be large: "I believe that if it doesn't rain out of buckets that day, then we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, coach manager in Cologne. "This is due to the fact that for two years there was a regular rose monday train. The train cannot be replaced by anything, of course."
The festival committee in Cologne does not express itself in detail at cost. However, the train is generally "deficient", that is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and self-mentioned vodka
It is not for nothing that Ukrainians are considered drink-proof. There is local beer such as obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other big breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I cannot notice much difference in taste. The same is true for the vodka, which is widely used. They burn this here especially on the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. Nobody knows how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption has fallen by a fabulous 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that you should be careful as a tourist. But this only applies if he goes into the mass sale. Then there is probably also a wrecking.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards herself for a great deal of effort: "Match happiness on our site"

Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees the favourite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and Oberhofer mascot "Flocke" at the arena
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medals in Oberhof's World Championship sprint. But there were two ray of hope in the fog.
As much as the Federal President made an effort, it was not clear on Saturday from the official gallery whether the windows were really falling on the shooting range. "I had to get the results via their mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with smiles and referred to the fog who repeatedly moved into the stadium, which severely affected the view of the race trail for the spectators.
Nevertheless, Steinmeier enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon Championships in Oberhof, he received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier had won gold in the first race, I was fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and praised Oberhof for his modernised sports facilities: "The rough arena is great. The athletes also say this - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the award of the World Championships". In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now "one step ahead" for many others and thus "for the next few years and even decades safe".
The Norwegian Johannes Thingne's gust once again spent athletes singing. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second world championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his penalty-free brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penal round/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) perfectly won the Norwegian quadruple victory.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph, the local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals. Johannes Kühn took eighth place after a shooting error and with a lack of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. WM debut Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After its palletized mixed operation on Wednesday, the Black Forest had five windows standing this time and disappeared as 55th deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
In front of 14,300 spectators had entered the race with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, during his last two standing shots he was lucky enough; they each landed at the edge of the windows and fell still. The 29-year-old the award ceremony then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, five years older: "It is the best feeling to be here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the persecution on Sunday. Among the women, on the other hand, the German hopes of Herrmann-Wick are suspended. "When you start with number one, the goal is not to get in as a tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend number one," Sports Director Felix Bitterling took his "Caromotive" into its duty. The organizers can expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 3.30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "bee swarm" on the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides at epial ball.
Aggressive start-up players or complaint coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmencies. Referee head Fröhlich points out a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviors of the players who, according to decisions, surround the referees a little like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old from the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmencies. We will pay more attention to this again - and will sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches were also considered with court references. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the Red Card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was known as Gelb-Rot. "The trainer behaviour also falls within the area of unsportsmenade. We have noticed that unsports are increasing in this area too, that behaviour has become a bit more demanding or aggressive towards us arbitrators. We also want to consistently punish such unsportslike," said Brych.
DFB arbitrator boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and impartial. "Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent backlashes. This will have to be the case for the person concerned. This should not be anything shattering about the world," said Fröhlich of the German press agency.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from the emotionality during the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal vilification, then one must also accept that the corresponding measures are taken by the arbitrator side," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have dispelled things after. "It would only be important if a circumstance thinking process were to get underway that such behaviour simply does not belong," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organised by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to potential impacts at another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always stain. There is a role model effect, resulting imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behaviour," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometre long cross-country ski race of the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter, achieved victory. The third party was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.

They prepare themselves with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will be held from the 21st topic. February to 5th February March in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team can feel this," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.

Arrest Warrants after Building Collapse in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favoured the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued an arrest warrant against dozens of suspects.

In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants were issued against 33 people, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors.

President-in-Last President of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left-wing group in the Bundestag said. The 95-year-old died on the night of Saturday. Group chairwoman Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left politicians as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," the link in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing "a significant figure," explained the head of the parliamentary group, Dietmar Bartsch, and former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1. Secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on the 13th day of the wall, In November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's chamber elections on the 18th In March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maiziere.
The chairman of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the Twitter short message service as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist." Bartsch added:
"Up to old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
"The entire peaceful course of the production of German unity was precisely a special merit by him. This will remain his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary. It is also worth:
"His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS has always been to represent also that part of the former GDR population who was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat in the German Bundestag for the PDS between 1990 and 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As the German Press Agency (dpa) report says, Modrow saw the new state "quite critically". According to dpa, Modrow criticised many interviews too quickly, and the GDR had become too unconditionally going down, and it was condemned as an "injustice state" too one-sided.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Selensky sentenced Russian missile attacks. However, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs on the electricity grid.
Kiev - The recent wave of Russian rocket attacks once again forces emergency repairs on the Ukrainian energy network. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several heat and hydropower plants were damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The electricity supply in the area of Kharkiv is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytsky Station (Kutery) plants, and production was smelled at the Khmelnytsky Station (Vovene and Southern Ukraine) nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Selenskyi condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received this week on his trip to London, Paris and Brussels.
Selenskyj does not want to let the small town of rumblem
On 24. War has been held for a year in February. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to the important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. The danger of Russian rocket attacks, however, continued on the night of Saturday. In the capital Kiev, the air alarm was triggered for the fifth time for this day late on Friday evening. "It is threatened with drones," said the military administration of the Kiev area. Iranian combat drones were also sighted and shot down in the south over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal Government selects consultants for network company
Demands, among other things, the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split them off, failed because of the coalition partner SPD. The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, is to be jointly oriented towards the public in future. This means that it does not need to make any profits and to pay off.
Redevelopment backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government to support this process. The remediation of the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently operating very unpunctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of removing this problem by completely resurgently removing entire rail corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations of the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had not even spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse had not come down even after coming in. "So a race," and that at the Home World Championships, "you can't describe that in words," she said. 11,000 spectators joked to roe the downing threshing music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into the arms.
"Enjoying biathlon," she had planned
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure was particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the world championship as the biggest, if not the only German medal hope, away from the relay. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She currently ranks fifth in the overall World Cup. And even if the performance density of the women in the peak is significantly higher than with the men, where only Johannes Thingnes BÃ3 and his Norwegians dominate at present, they had more others on the note for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years imprisonment
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been very tense since 2018. At that time, demonstrators who demanded the resignation of Ortegas had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. In the following years, thousands of people left the Central American country, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of forging a plot together with the US government to overthrow.
Bundeswehr: Armaments industry demands more orders from special assets
The first arms projects have therefore already been cancelled, further projects are threatened with the same thing as the "World on Sunday" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be abolished in concrete terms. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible savings need at this stage," says the Federal Government's reply to a request by the member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechen (CDU).
The background to the declining investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully loan-financed special assets, which the Bundestag adopted in June 2022, has to bear the interest burdens for the loans themselves. If these steps up, therefore less money is available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the purchasing power of the remaining amount is falling due to the current high inflation.
Copper cell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.2), around 01.40, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to drive left towards the motorway in the direction of Heilbronn onto the motorway to the motorway. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as the police announced. During the BMW driver's turning process, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both accident participants stated that the traffic light installation installed at the scene showed "green" for them. A review of the traffic light system did not reveal any complaint. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars were subject to a total of around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarters commemorate the victims of the earthquake catastrophe
Many Stuttgarters followed the appeal of the Feuerbach Ditib-Moscheegemeinde on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is great sympathy - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is occupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people were thinking of the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many members of the community had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's supplication and silent. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. He asked, among other things, for health, protection against plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The municipality also asked for assistance and strength to "take our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The prayers were also translated into German on Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already gathered several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations of kinds in the Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be brought into the earthquake areas by lorry. The helpfulness there, too, was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat insert - Ebersberg
"After dinner you should do a thousand steps ".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Through home office, who does not sit in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow, now uses the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or, in substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least one could win this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 pm not only dog owners can cavort.
One reason, of course, could also lie in the fact that people of modern times can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of an optimal time slot usage. Why not learn news from the settlement from the long-being neighbour on the occasion of a short march through nature? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? In this way, too, you could be connected to work and private life - who says that the appointment cannot take place outdoors with a tax consultant, lawyer or investment consultant? Unless there are no ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do is the acquisition of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands with a hit on a table along the way. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if you have not already considered the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. In Hinteregglburg, an elderly couple leave the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and regret in the voice. "It's a pity, we have unfortunately forgotten the money."
The disappointment can be compared, but you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What the sympathetic chance acquaintance is also known. What the man replies: "But that's not true! You have a bag with you!" It shows on the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an extra headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one starts the way back with meat insert and has become richer in this midday short trip not only for a lamb singing, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Clamped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old took his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, from an unexplained cause, departed from the roadside in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a leading post, crashed sideways against a tree and stopped a few metres away. The collision caused the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency services took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of riding initial ability, the collection of a blood sample was ordered. According to police report, the Audi amounted to a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled that the tax authority has to hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry said in the decision of the ministry of Friday.
Contrary to political practice in the US, real estate entrepreneur Trump had not publicised his tax return as a candidate or later as president. He opposed a publication until the Supreme Court. A public prosecutor's office in New York has received the documents in the meantime, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The publication to Congress is probably more sensitive to Trump: there, the circle of authorized persons is slightly larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, there is repeatedly coming out of parliament confidential.
The chairman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican tax documents is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as president," said Pelosi.

British criminals captured after long fleeing in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. The British criminal investigation department NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai policemen in a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the criminals most sought by the NCA.
According to the authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 before the start of a court case in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison in absentia for attempted import of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros) in absente.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and who, according to his own figure, loves Viennese humour, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. This is what the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits with this. Whether this fits well in the generally predominant local scientific scepticism here is a must be seen. His humour fits very well with Vienna.
By the way, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's younger life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York in 2019 as a stand-up comedian. Now, however, he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge juice actually is and what it can - and what not. Corona also occurs, of course, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks down to the most important question that many are pushing ahead: what is really important? All this with a huge wink, untwitched and very ironic. And so not only are therefore good at work, but can also learn something.

1. General information
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the fighting from the viewing perspective of a tank driver. The battles are held in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with provisional protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-hole tanks, as well as nimble rockets, which are becoming increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. They cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can reach a high score through a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction process, the game inductor sequence, the game set, the initial input for high results and the self-test process. The latter operating mode represents a special process fUr the checking of the control elements and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game process is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the play noise becomes audible. If the last player armor is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that are visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by respecting the text displayed at the top left display angle of his cockpit. For example, a note can be: GEGNER OF RIGHT. In addition, on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, a point that represents the enemy position is visible.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, GEGNER IN FIRE AREA is displayed in the upper left warning display.
At time, UFO's become visible on the screen, which fly over the battlefield. These are safe missiles who observe the combat events and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be recorded by the radar. The UFO's are said to round off the fighting events and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with opposing tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the opponent's armor. A shot by the player brings this 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: for a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a rocket 2,000 points and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super-tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the stand the opportunity to use a gameplay 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the show of the rocket varied for further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option can be found in the image.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of the high scores, ER or YOU can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the end of play. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, the filming of the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the mains voltage, the table with the maximum results is deleted. When deleted (RESET), the ten (10) top scores with their initials are received and re-entered on the screen to challenge more players. Each score , which is over 100,000, is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their pders their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enroll strokes. After this, the device will switch back to the attraction gameplay. CONSTRUCTION REGULATION
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer part of the housing, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the centering bellows made of rubber, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever into the middle position. The micral teres are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y playing was extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of diser switching technical k, more lines on the screen are created at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and calm image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply, given by expanding the circuit. D. The Gerate housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin setting. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended for smaller players as a platform to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation station.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown on Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform some check to round off quality control. To be confident that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be made: NOTE: Device not yet following the 220 V network. A. Check out the outside of the case for damage. B. Open the device's maintenance flap and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all wire harness plugs for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose plugs together.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The connectors are provided with forced leadership, so that a correct connection is established. A 180 degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the game PC board on proper and fixed fit. (3) Please note the production number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check whether the punched production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, control/Audio II PCB and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the cover page of this manual. This number should always be specified when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the operating console and the TV monitor for perfect installation. (5) The device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a view through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-coloured opening of the panel. If the opening is not exactly centered, the fairing attached to the housing, which is attached to the housing, must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the device to the mains, it must be ensured that the voltage voting connector on the power supply 1 (s. Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the plug-in values as listed below:
HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips to help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time and check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. With the DirectX diagnostic program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please do the following steps to start the DirectX diagnostic program: Click the "Start" button and select “Run” option. Enter in the text field "dxdiag". Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphic and sound cards. Among other things, you can check whether graphics and sound work properly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you to change options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It may happen that other programs seize the system resources that the game needs to run properly. It is not obvious to all of these programs that they are active, and many are automatically started when the system is booted up. Such programs, which are constantly active on their system, are also called “background applications”. In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend you to finish such background applications before you start the game. - If your system is running antivirus or crash guard programs, you should close or disable them before you start the game. To do this, look for the icon of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the corresponding option (“Disable” “Close”, or the like). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also stop general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section “How to exit all unnecessary background applications”. Cleaning up the system
Before you install software, it must be ensured that your hard drive works optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to “clean up” your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup to make everything run properly. Then the chances are great that current games run on your PC largely without problems. A “clean” system also has the advantage of having a much more efficient work, and thus other applications that you otherwise use, run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help Files to get ready through the ScanDisk or ScanDisk tools Error checking, defragmentation and data carrier cleansing. Using the Windows Help
1. Click on the "Start" button and select the option "Help" (or. “Help and Support”) to call the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the Search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. B. “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), "Error exam" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive instructions that will explain how to use these tools.
The game crashes or depends?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This way, you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Below are the latest graphics card manufacturers:
How to Stop All Misturic Background Application

Now the “Close application” window is displayed, where all background applications that are running on your system will be listed. 2. To finish a background application, click the entry in the task list and then click the “Stop Task” button. Note: Under no circumstances do not terminate the background applications Explorer and Systray, as they are required to run Windows. All other background applications can be safely terminated. 3. The window is now closed and the task is finished. Repeat the above steps to stop all other background applications (except for "Explorer" and "Systray"). Windows 2000/XP Professional
1. Hold down CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press ENTF. Now the Windows security window is displayed. 2. Click “Task Manager” to open Windows Task Manager. To finish a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the task list, and then click the "End Task" button. Note: Depending on your system settings, it may happen that the Windows security window is not displayed when printing on CTRL, ALT and ENTF, but the Windows Task Manager will appear immediately. Windows XP Home
1. Hold down CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press ENTF. Now the Windows Task Manager is displayed. 2. To exit a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the task list, and then click the "End Task" button. Before you call the hotline
If you wish to call, you should sit down at your PC and keep the following information ready (see section “Checking the System Configuration”). Please also prepare note material. - PC brand and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (memory) - Information about graphics and sound cards and drivers
Alone WORDS FOR THE EARTH
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me a new means of expression, with the help of which the world could be reached its limits. For me, it was a way to open up new horizons. I came to myself like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th Century before: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything was still needed to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games took advantage of only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too much out of “action” and about it a fundamental element of the human experience world: the sensations. In the meantime, the technology continues to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expressing, transmitting feelings. Even if this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting against hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting on boxes to obtain ammunition, but also has far more sophisticated and profound content. It is proof that you can tell a story as well as offer a game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are more sceptical about video games, I may hope that Fahrenheit will help you change your attitude to this. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has presented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we have repeatedly been forced to question many of the principles that had previously been considered irrefutable. I would be lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also did not pass you entirely without a trace. David Cage

This SERVICE MANUAL is intended to familiarize you with the installation and maintenance of the QIX TV combined machine. On the front sides, the gameplay is described - in addition to important notes for the installation and maintenance. The subsequent service tips require general knowledge of microprocessors, TTL circuits and TV monitors. Without knowledge in these areas, no repair of the electronic device part should be attempted. The electrical plans are completed. We ask you to carefully observe the instructions of this manual in order to ensure the satisfactory function of the machine.
The information and illustrations contained in this SERVICE MANUAL correspond to the status of the current printing. CHANGES IN THE INSINARY PROCESSING PRODUCTS, EVERY NOT AFTER EVERYTHING! Please note when making a list
Transport damage
Insofar as external transport damage is recognizable, they must be objected to immediately, kept on a transport certificate and confirmed by the delivery company (forwarder, federal rail, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Mains voltage
The device is set for the mains voltage specified on the nameplate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to the VDE regulation, the device is equipped with protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Implications-free work of the coin complex requires the right to set up the device. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor at any time, please switch off the automatic machine for a short time (plug the network plug) and on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Pull off the power plug before repair! When monitoring and testing: Tension-leading parts do not touch! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still cause dangerous voltage. ATTENTION, HIGH ESTATION! There are about 20,000 volts at the anode connection of the picture tube. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A blown backup signals overload of a component. If the backup is replaced by a higher grade, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuit/connections when the device is switched on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (at a minimum loan 2) for 2 players. You have to try to get a lot of space without crossing the path of rotating QIX and without encountering the migrating SPARX. The gameplay is set so that a minimum preset area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX is displayed by red timing lines. At the coincidence of the red lines, additional SPARX will be released. When the alarm, the SPARX becomes SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your area, your marking sign gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed, as you cannot cross your own path, or can return. If you hesitate and do not complete your surface, a fuse will be infected and your mark will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. With slower drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control pulse, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work properly. For further information see "Service Program". The volume can be done on the volume heightener (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This advertisement chooses the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set with the help of the "Sub-Test" button. If the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Application programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, a "highest number of loans" that may be allowed to be set before the game starts can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By using multiple pressure on the "sub-test" switch, the factory or Basic setting is achieved when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press "Up" button. The values are reset, the pointer (as the green appears called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score pointer to the next program display until "High hit rate until now". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs so that his own initials (names) and the hit points can be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the boundary is crossed, the coin take-off is blocked - if the coin lock is available. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be placed so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero if over 99 is added. A free spin mode can be selected by setting "High number loans" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": amount of % number that needs to be achieved to switch to the next passage
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": difficulty of the gameplay
"Train on the holder": no sound at stand-alone operation
for "1" clay also at stand operation (animated) "table model": for "0" standpipe
at "1" tabletop device
The loans per coin are set to the "insertion slot programming" display. High score program display (highest hit rate until now"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set to highscore selected on the previous display (adjusting from "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "total evaluation". By pressing the "Up" button can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total loan: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts from the beginning. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or the W1 plug connection is removed when the device is switched off. Left-side coins: Number of coins thrown in in the left coin insertion slot. Medium coins: (not available) Right-sided coin coin coin coin insertion slices: coins inserted. paid loans: Number of loans given for thrown (overvalued coins). Loans granted: Number of loans given by the device. % Free Spins: Granted loans (paid + loans granted per 100) Decreasing minutes Played: Number of minutes played. Decreasing minutes: Number of minutes, at extended or won game. % Leisure Time: winner minutes/played minutes per 100. Average playing time in second: minutes/paid + granted loans
High Score: Number in which a player had enough high hit odds to displace other players from the highscore list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Insertion slot programming/normal money suspension. With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be selected from the stand or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" button, while the top digit lights green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the number. If the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is taken over. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. After a single pressure, the upper setting count is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by selecting a setting that is obvious to its desired values and only changes the values that are not appropriate. Once the setting is done, each new size can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. The standard setting appears when pressed unintentionally. The "Up" and "Down" switches can increase or decrease the values. By pressing the "Test" switch, the process is ended. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted by an assigned slot. Coin units - "credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. coin" is a value that accumulates loans until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) OFF
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in dom all programming stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are set to factory setting. This condition probably indicates failure or fault of the battery.
ERROR CHEON and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Print the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The checks and settings can be entered for the respective program display, and the next program is displayed by pressing the "Test" button. If a long-term test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in auto test mode. With this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. If the display "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. With J 19 removed plug, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O Ã... out / I Ã a / X test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the checksum ROM is error-friendly, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display needs to be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional security of the memory, which is shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt with the above etc. Display holds, a bug has been discovered. If the Communications RAM fails during the video board test, the error may have caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board of P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are enrolled in another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all storage points are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device is equipped with the above. Display holds, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers follow will be checked for correctness when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, related multiplexers and decoders.
Video-Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is checked by enrolling a pattern on each page. The results of these registrations are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy will keep the program and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If an display RAM fails, notice the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not indicate RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it shows that the next check is begun (data hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be available and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappears
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for Stern No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without recognizable seam errors. BUT I was too happy for this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she is supposed to sit so tight and I did not want to fight myself in a S or M at my bust size.... In the end, she would have fitted in length and at the hip...in the rest I could swim. In addition, the food material already came towards you when the package was opened and distributed everywhere. Just a pity.. She is sent back :/
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. They can be worn well from both sides. We ordered her for our daughter, she is totally enthusiastic. Otherwise it wears the 158 and it fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my fault. I then slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad is very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. It is possible to use the nut or the whole area. Has worked without problems. It slips nix more. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too large for under 1 year
The product itself I okay, but not under one year. As the area to chew is nevertheless much too big for a small mouth. We brought him when our son was 7 months and he could not use it for the size. Now at 12 months we were looking for him out and he can use it. Has not yet been able to bite anything with its already available teeth. And when he was in the refrigerator, it calms him away.
Quality not sufficient / unfortunately goes back
I have probably had myself blinded here by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I want to send in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large (for the storage of the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small low pro has now finally become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day, I purchased this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the renowned products, which are sold at far higher prices.... Guys, that's not true! I had really hoped that it was so, but it can really not be talk of it. The padded walls are considerably thinner and do not provide such protection as my Lowepro. Ohs the separations inside, are of another caliber, much more unstable. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared with my Lowepro. The rice closures and the materials of the small material for the small material are not exactly high. Therefore, I decided that the backpack goes back. If I create an equipment of many thousands of EUR, then unfortunately I have to take the money into my hand for a reasonable backpack. Quality appears to have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it is not the case that I had made the decision difficult. When I unpacked the backpack, after 2 minutes I knew that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will find your things much faster than with a grey inner life. For someone who has other demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
Until now, the electrics series of E. L. Todd likes best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommended and had really looked very much at the third part. In the part, all the time about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily prolonged. Taylor has been enthusing about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and is then like a little child in every argument and warped?! At the same time, there were also discrepancies, my feeling, because in the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe he when he said that Taylor would stand on him and tries to convince the ex that Taylor could not do it without him and he himself had heard it. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this was the last part of the row and think that this part was the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. Nevertheless, I will read the fourth part and hope that will finally come out, who is Taylor's girlfriend Sarah the ex from Volt. That would bring more tension into history.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn! First of all, Sooo is not bad the film now, as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and repeatedly conceited according to the same scheme F. When you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn to do so! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often did I only think of the film (although I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, then you often shoot tears in your eyes. Jurassic World The fallen kingdom is already really well done. It's just a pity that the person simply doesn't pick the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying the animal and the environment and the end of our planet and ourselves. From greed and profit, and stupidity and arrogance ! Empathy for the environment and living organisms :Fell display. 4 stars, because the movie is well done, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Still well done popcornKino.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film Ã la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is above all "French" - it is also calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and brings you to cry - if you get involved with him and do not expect anything from him that he doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but do not care. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bluebefore than ever! Then lapse 5-8 times daily. Little helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been since 1 week. It is noticeable that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given at the larger full 5 ? That is very strange!
terrible stench and small result! I dyed my blond hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. At the first time I noticed directly that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, there was a chestnut brown (a little darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions for non-satisfied results. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first attempt. What was all the worst, it has spent weeks after application still smelling.. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell simply did not disappear.
Highly recommended
I'm taking the tablets space for a long time and getting one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time because of my work, too little exercise and an even longer additional disease. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy diets but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 something on the trials. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to keep in mind how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not quite perfect !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case, I discovered the following rough defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The shell has problems with the time to "connect" to the mobile phone. This means that the "Power On/Off" button is not loaded for 3 seconds. If you remove the cell phone from the shell and reintegrate you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the mobile phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it detaches itself from the shell, which is why I almost lost it several times. These are not many rough defects, however, I think that a shell with battery should work perfectly in its function and therefore I am very disappointed with the product for the cost of 30€, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how to achieve this whole rating. Ultimately, it is actually an eyewear cleaning cloth, which you get a gift from each optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is almost with a kitchen towel and not better. I promised much more of these cloths it is really very thin. Since I have used it I cannot exchange it anymore I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far more than 2 euros you should not be.
I doubt at the frequency response
I bought this loudspeaker for the shower than my smaller free loudspeaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (me shcon liked in the shower), gives bass back like bass, Bluetooth works great... Suction cup, of course, you have to water, otherwise it will solve itself.. it can present sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as a bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just well audible enough. My old speaker didn't show up as bass well as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in the volume. With Onforu this is not really the case, which I already find a bit annoying. Therefore I have to peel off a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
The color was chipped off and if you only walked over it with your hand, the color went off to some. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we did not want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did it all for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in quality. Items are supplied to pieces which you have to stick together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman the product has literally stuffed into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I did not complain about it because I urgently needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks tidily - like chewing gum, which does not get hard. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off from the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry (at least, it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to stick to everything. The templates are partly incompletely punched. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, however, at a wedding I would invest a little more money and resort to a high-quality product.
Not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic clasp + beautiful look + stable when it is assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors bang through magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber studs) - some unclean places
- Supplied dowels are much too small and shaking (had no others and she was not in the house since there was no cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wiggle something (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If he didn't look so good and had such good measurements, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything suitable to be really satisfied. In addition, I also find it a little too expensive for it.
The coffee tastes good to me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if any!). The additional plastic waste (individually packed s.photo) also means a star print for me. I hope the manufacturer will change this and soon collect full score.
Go to the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and very loud. I couldn't put them quieter either. Probably a defect, allegedly this was possible. The quietest radio shot was also too loud for me, so I immediately step out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned his face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too light for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you cannot dim the coloured light. Well, I also found that it has a battery so that the clock and the alarm time does not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure. However, it would be returned for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, insufficient processing
I have replaced four lamps in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a frame - instead a board laughs at this point... There was nothing in the box. "6 Pay - 4 Received" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have settled this accommodatingly and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see it as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two star printout. The light itself is great. The rooms are now illuminated very brightly and evenly. The light colour is more likely towards cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living spaces I would personally reach to warmer light. All the way comparable with a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do these things and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is an aid, I would be pleased to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would love to share my first look. Yes, positive. I think for a long time if I order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 °F. **They do not forward the heat and can be touched directly with it. **The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after wipe and they are gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-Ware as Neuware Sold
Amazon Prime Shipping Simply Tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, tap unpacked and all parts checked.We noticed that the part was already installed. We have seen considerable scratching and abrasions on all assembly parts. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even scratch marks / streaks can be seen on the chrome-plated tap. This part has probably been delivered before and returned. We keep this tap and build the one in the sink in the basement because there does it do not look like it. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods via Amazon but rather give something more in the DIY store where we get sad goods. Just find it sad that customers are so affected!!!
Product top, Outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation went very easily from instead, and the radio range is also very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside out. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, and plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably in place, because completely astronomical values of outdoor humidity are always displayed. This is a pity, since the device was attached outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt to deliver stand today is still rolling with Hermes through the Republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon was outstanding as always with the triggering a replacement delivery. The mower quickly arrived at me and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and the result is a nice section. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a big drawback. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and in between of the fabric. If you only settle it briefly, then of course it is compressed and parts of the content fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator already points to red at half a full catch. That would not be so bad if the mower did not lose large parts of the cut material from then on. Always empty the basket with a large lawn area when it is only half full, cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned and sent the device back as well as possible. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, which becomes unusable for me due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. Very good is the included insertable sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solid. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only shown once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed quite fidtly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses the connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and return after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to cut the Hotbed really well. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, nevertheless the hotbed there is still too high and on the right there virtually falls out, because it is not at all tightened even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the car are straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because it is impossible to print something out. To be built: The setup was quite problemless You could only show how to lay the cables because you otherwise have to relocate them several times, which is very strained. I have already written support now but still did not receive an answer after a week of waiting. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. I had expected a little more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the spirit after many years, so a new one had to come here. This makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurement. There are two batteries, so that you can get started directly. The packaging of the slider is simple, but it fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full points and believe it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. From there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, permanent odor
Have bought the bracelet and for the time have not worn, as it exudes a disgusting smell. To date, this smell is not gone, although it has been "ventilated". After returning is no longer possible, I disposed of it. Rate of purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so that it seems quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite a bit. However, the chain is very simple, so that I have torn the closure twice. So far I have been able to fix it again and again, but I think that it won't go/keep for long. But for the low price you simply cannot expect anything really high quality.
Very nice jewel
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple buckle actually lasts! You just have to pull the end through its mouth, it can't rise, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: those who have something magnetic on the arm: The buckle is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was ok. Now to the function: If only connects after some gimmicks... doesn't keep to the instructions it even work, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also the display of the three stations was very different! All in all not to use for me! The thing went back! Would affect a purchase, only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I already had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inside shaft was done. I only bought them again for one reason, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the derivation would fit. I hope that the shaft at the previous pump had a production error and that the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the artificial housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend to pack the pump a little better in the future than just use a thin-walled carton. I still kept the pump, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and did not affect the pumping performance in the plastic housing.
If one could have been better able to think through. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than walking around with a huge keychain all the time. At the beginning everything was quite good. However, the paint then lowered quite quickly and the screws always had to be pulled. It's great that this also goes with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slotted screwdriver, which would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. To get to the most annoying thing: the attachment of the keys. You are nice by the different parts, the screw to different sizes or. Lengths can be put, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need a pair of pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Applying the keys in themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the third times mounting the screw in the thread has broken off and thus the complete thing was unusable. Conclusion: If at all for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but with the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all in a spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will actually be able to judge the goods only after the first bet. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the case - as before. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since there were still two smaller bags in the round cosmetic bag. Not processing high quality, I still wanted to mention that. That the cosmetic bag has a different colour and is made of other material, than the other bags, does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a tasting price and that's ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and has worked until after Christmas. Now that when I wanted to use it again, he didn't do it anymore. Battery? Exchanged. But he still does not work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
Care is always good! Application is simple, but it is already very careful to go suitable with the brush not to damage a needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound of my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables. Battery runtime is enough for a long time. Definitely perfectly sufficient sound. I like that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The earcups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is good wearable for the most varied occasions.. Price-performance is fully in line with this, especially since I also bought it in the flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (has recommended). I would only have liked the neckline would not be so deep, and the sleeves could also tolerate a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Fingers away. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect such a scrap to be sold today. The drive is operated on a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It is believed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD normally goes, Blu-rays are recognized as maximum unreliable. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes noise like old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives no longer than one has heard them since the 90s. After minutes you can either restart the computer because there is nothing left or the disc is finally recognized. But then you can't press a pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or even anything during the film. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar additionally, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it is supposed to do, but it is not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually eyewear, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that why I was a little disappointed when I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a despicable extension, I would certainly not have bought this shaped lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my miscalculation, the extension fulfils its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not simply get around in the area as with a completely normal extension cord. So no real mispurse, but my euphoria is within narrow limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) as well as being able to connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I also had to send back could not do so. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller per BT on my tablet and that of the HDMI on TV. Simultaneous loading is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else I use my PlayStation :P There was a small adapter with which one can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, this does not fit with the adapter. Well keeps so secure and has contact from there... All in all, although somewhat expensive, however, justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole piece and made stable in one aluminium. Price performance fits.
Any amount of performance
Top device. Runs without problems for months. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings neat performance. I find the meaning of the temperature rather too cold and therefore always on the road at level 2. Has already fallen on the tile floor several times and has survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitive products like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference is very large compared to the original, but does not make a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without restriction.
Great product with weakening battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode is the location on 0.5m accurate. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, he likes to jump a few meters, but not disturbing. Would I buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. He currently holds about 1.5 hours. Here would be a solution great which 7-14 days would be created. There is an XL version, but unfortunately this is too great for our taste, as long as the battery does not have to hold out with us and change daily we also find impractical. One should not be engaged in the dog with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
Waste after a few weeks
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son is only wearing the shoes in physical education class, the sole broke after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used any further. With the last couple, it was also in normal use so that they didn't last very long, but I thought it will be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are more expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs after 5 years unfortunately broke down, so I had ordered new ones with pleasure. These here are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance. They are easily just like the one I had before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the retaining band by the heel sits quite loosely and very unlike five years will hold like my previous one. I'm curious!
Surprisingly Good
Since there are hardly any reviews to be read here, I was very sceptical. However, since I drive to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them for good luck. The mattress and a car air pump were included. To the mattress: I spent them testing in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mould on one side. I wiped it away and hope it doesn't show up again. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly. It is good on it and fits perfectly with the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace its own bed, but the one for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Before that, we took out the seats at the back. It fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is placed in the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder). Since my friend is skilled in craft, he was able to repair it and assembled the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress into zero comma Nix. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I am looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that she will not lose any air and will last long. Likewise, it does not reappear mold. After the test I can definitely recommend it. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar of me only gets two stars. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open via several doors by laying down the laying processing directly on day 1. On the 21st No more doors were dormitory and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly because they already fell to him. The parts often get out of each other, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to bring the parts. After the car is completely assembled together, parts will fall off when playing. (Most of the windscreen. This can also be very badly reattached.) In itself I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend anyone. The manufacturers may reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter is flying with it. Inside, the flies very well and the 5 min. As a rule, flight time is enough. I didn't expect anything else at the price, but falls from the floor to the floor, no matter whether tiles or carpets, are no problem at the price. For questions nice contact.
Play ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. Didn't see when buying that it's not a game CD, but merely a code that you can use to download the game. That would be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is an insolence. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging on, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately it fails due to the battery's battery
I was very happy about the watch. Design and look great, messages etc were easily displayed. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Drr large hook: the battery and its runtime. In the evening, overnight located only on drm closet and 11% less battery in the morning with non-use. When the day came a lot of news, the battery was already at the end of noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, for me not useful. A very pity.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely buy a cover. I have last liked shells into which you can also plug the credit card. This is what the shell here offers. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather shell makes a sturdy impression and seems to be well finished. It looks noble. The cell phone is embedded unlike many other cases around it, only at the connections are cut-outs. Otherwise you can operate on an off switch and volume control on the sides well through the cover. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone by the thickness of the shell. It does not even work on the QI leather charging station by TORRO. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be loaded when the cover is done. Otherwise really chic and well finished !
high quality sleeve with bulletproof glass film
Robust case mt a real bulletproof glass as a protector for the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily mounted. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not contaminate. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some stop. It is not too bulky and is fixed on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
