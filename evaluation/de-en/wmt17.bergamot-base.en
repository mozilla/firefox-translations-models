28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother testified that he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "Finally it went uphill again with him."
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco medical department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had gotten up his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughter said they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will sorely miss him," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"In everything going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's information telephone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this unequivocally clear in an interview.
“I’m always put in drawers or get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I myself do not have a desire to always be perfect and successful.”
“Honestly, these things are rather sniffy to me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dud and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
To the white glow, she brings the question of the desire to have children: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be complete," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - Love is Not a No Child's Play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The movie will run from us from the 25. August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a first.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their after-work, they chased home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.
A kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And with that, the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back close to horses.
He was led with his family over the facility of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swing for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th. Winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been promoting the next generation for decades.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsleigh driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policies in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those rather small when in doubt and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, Trump claims.
He will massively scale back regulations, and he is campaigning for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people and needs money for it.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, they are both very close to the issue of infrastructure.
They must be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic Democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.
So Trump could still have internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the US again.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
“It’s going to be either China, Germany or America — I want us to be.”
But not only in terms of infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade deal, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They should be better paid, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must go up, then he says he must not be changed.
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics hold him, so the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton stands, who at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby with him who is at most one year old.
One of them put her young son in her arm.
He looks into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table top.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women alone and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich’s Frauenhilfe.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard outside the door.
"It's not an exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls," she recounts.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, this continues.
"That smugglers, for example, are calling for a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon," Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that will end as soon as they arrive in Germany is crazy, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
“Some of the children certainly did not come into being voluntarily.”
Many women are so used to say nothing.
“Or they don’t dare to talk openly about what they have experienced, because the shame is too great.”
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, women who have refugeed alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, in some shared accommodation there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
“If privacy is lacking or if men and women are housed together, there may be – more continuous – violence against women.”
The washrooms in particular should be separate and easily accessible to women, according to the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the rush, which is on the house in Munich.
"Since it's been said that we exist, we've got a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Calls for new industrial action
Assistant doctors' deputies have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The British Medical Association's Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called for its entire advice to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC testified that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
Resident physicians and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "perseverely calm" to problems, causing the treaty to be rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins in early September.
The disputes led to residents going on strike six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Residents Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings that took place even before the vote by 54,000 resident physicians and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Received Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report, a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin tributed, accusing Ankara of having stabbed Russia in the back.
The offense was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also rocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its response to the attempted seizure of power a weak response.
Add to that the ongoing grudge over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup.
For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent one, as one analyst once described to me, "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel disowned by the West and feel badly treated and now ally.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it's certainly better for the two leaders to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She backed the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and staff in Inverness-shire during a sightseeing tour.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" the chief executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori hits 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He relied on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said: "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the cheers as he picks up victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone that few before him have reached.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already picked up 6,000 wins if he weren't just a weekend and grand tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden in the UK for almost 30 years of winner, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole host of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue at competitions until the age of 50.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old has been appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, it reads that Putin, without giving reasons, "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's website states (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of government personnel.
On his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This move has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men claimed the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of it here - especially now, just before the general election.
So is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president would like to run Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
Once, it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before announcing his termination.
On the set, there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details of how the character Gibsons will be written out of the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is on the 28th. September scheduled.
Mystery surrounding fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandals spewed out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, the ca. Living 500 metres from the sea, a video of the spectacle posted on Periscope in the hope that someone might shine some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blower" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 slashed ropes.
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the countryside to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the final section of the deck is now in Rosyth with a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, approx. 6,000 tons weighs and with a slope of approx. 3% had to be pulled up.
Delicate, since the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men have 'lucky still being alive'
Three men have "lucky still to be alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded the BST at 13:20 on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety while their boat moved on on their own.
"We saw the boat roting around it near them and imagined the worst," said the head of Moelfre Vince Jones's rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their range until we let it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who have been thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop line, but this detached from the person who was steering the boat while capsizing the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
She could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
Therefore she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be much more obliged in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of housing" for the next council meeting.
But disputes are programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the existing building.
The big point of contention in the town hall, however, is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing on such land.”
A new urban housing promotion program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is set to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, a worsening of the situation in the housing market is approaching.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the skilled workers.
But the program is not yet completely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1300 affordable apartments, the funding of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be bought by the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
In one fell swoop, the problem could be solved.
Because in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: that's what the owners, the housing associations don't want.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, one moves away from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There should be no concentration of socially disadvantaged people in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join the boat."
It has focused on more building sites for single-family houses.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.
Therefore, it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest dropped somewhat before the game's release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "tapped."
A generation who played the game when she was even younger joined the madness and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
A lot of public education campaigns on health, which people want to get people to "take 30 minutes," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" have come down to deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Still, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships while hunting.
As always, there are also grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What the hell?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will subside over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthier.

Simone Biles manages gold in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
effortless on the beam.
Breathtaking on the floor.
All along the line brilliantly.
And now finally Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone's eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics.
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles gymnastics on the suspended beam during the women's individual multi-match final in art gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and overall the fifth, while consolidating her reputation for being the best of her generation, or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion told Mary Lou Retton of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
It awaited her a final trial in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver each in the women's singles multi-match final in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation point at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long road to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their floor exercises - which include their typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became a force.
She hasn't lost a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two twists, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently embraced her as they awaited her end result - a pure formality - and tears flocked to Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but went the bronze medal in a tiebrake to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her floor exercise, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot dead in car while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead who died in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first Phoenix serial killer case while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elli's daughter, Maleah, were on the 12th. June shot while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
Police said the triple murder does not appear to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The Phoenix Sgt Police Spokesman. Jonathan Howard said the shooting tricked investigators into becoming a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas, within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to be the serial killer's work.
Investigators found bullet casings and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It's getting better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I can’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get myself into that.
Which isn't true at all -- of course you've got into it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize him.
"My first response to that was, 'I didn't know people were still doing that,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until the age of three, and he still cannot speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can run with support and ride a bike.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund came up with for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as well as in Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosy in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood-projected vehicles, boats and sandbags were mounting.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed over much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will in all likelihood reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas via the treaded rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "propagated rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been significantly soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classroom failure in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa indicated 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets have been closed due to the floodwaters and sandbags have been provided for takeaway for residents who hope to be able to keep the water from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of homes are said to have been reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was punctured by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was classified as critical at a hospital and he had to undergo multiple surgeries.
The boy's family told the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are currently investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be located.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several gunmen.
Shell casings for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles oversaw the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on either side of the sidewalk, were pods.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police officer Anthony Ginaldi told police in Philadelphia.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar on her arm as she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine among the women's Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than a reason.
First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have had an inspiring effect for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering unexpected yet masterful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman to win gold at an individual multi-match event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but that's not what gymnastics classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. This is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued as desired.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must enable the communities of countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and more accessible gym training.
I started my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to the youth, who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting Olympic team gold and thank you, catch her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first resident doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Residents, said in a statement last night: "Asidentians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance to participate in the government and sometimes deafening silence.
That's what happened to that of a promise Jeremy Hunt had made just last month about the fact that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the resident doctors.”
If he does not, the resident doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 resident doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the resident doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Action-based action does not achieve anything of little, but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only causes concern, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Associated Physicians' Committee and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per day drug after authorities have been advised to administer this more people for an extended period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE's regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE's regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that make up coverings.
When the surface breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack as a result.
When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE's draft guidance, published today, recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all individuals who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft instructions do not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Makes Voter Fraud Flourish in Muslim Areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud knowingly being ignored in Muslim communities, as a damning government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an antorruption king, said that intimidating voters for religious motives would be so bad that it should be allowed for police to set up barrier tapes outside voting booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter just needs to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when casting their voting vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed in particular alarmingly on the fraudulent postal vote - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping ID to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence, it was appropriate that pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
“There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of “politically correct” hypersensitivities to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists editing postal ballot documents to stop "electoral harvests."
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and welfare fraud purposes.
Considering options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use unremovable ink on a person's finger once they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic postal vote.
Banned that political activists handle complete postal votes and envelopes of postal votes.
Give the police the authority to set up barriers around polling stations.
A change in the law that facilitates an indictment for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
photography ban in voting stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (except for Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charge was filed after the Tower Hamlet's case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He became guilty on the basis of a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check-off checks" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning sign.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cyclist double and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week have fallen out of line over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive doppelganger.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer to have his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you're allowed to believe social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who bear more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Crew member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the racetrack, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-promine Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images in which he looks eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star emerged.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take centre stage this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doppelgänger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: This user is of the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested to by fans, an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt" on the same.
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish at the 4x200m freestyle swimming squad outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmyp Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squad.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the commentator team of the CBS to add more "color", could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squad 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, " Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "like a pig died"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squadron for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, at which many confronted him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #angekelt.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologised live for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologise for the commentary about a swimming performance broadcast."
It was an unfortunately chosen wording, we're sorry it happened."
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the notes via Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a notice.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on air and our followers on social media last night.
To be clear, Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance rather than her as a person.
Still, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by testifying that it was not his intention for her to be construed as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad on the CBC Olympic show," he said.
“I was referring to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.”
Of course, no contempt was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged by woman who shamelessly tries on underwear in the middle of the store
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
To make the situation worse, she surveyed how she looked in it, stripped her and put her back on the shelf.
She continued to browse, trying on four pairs of underpants at a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting her back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, "she got back on and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky as Oskar."
“Everyone was staring as she took off the underpants again, which she obviously didn’t like, as she put them back on the shelf.”
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, got back on and walked out.
"She didn't seem to mind anyone watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried on."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that had another person on and who were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "As I've heard, the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and took off again and they were not washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is the incident that turns out on Tuesday, the 9th. August at our branch in Folkstone happened, consciously."
All the products in question have been pulled from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
If you're approaching from behind, then you should turn around first so you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him in the groin with his knee and twist the gun out of his hands while the attacker curls up in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it does it to Mizrachi.
But remember that with a robbery, it's safest to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and strangulation reflex to serious scrutiny - by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his train on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about promoting gut bacteria, as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flush buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film, he recounted: "Even as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the movie, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after their luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one in less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in various places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with us saying "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Anti-social family destroyed before delogation Social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left her social housing after a delogation with a £50,000 damage because she had terrorised her neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family have been relocated and it is believed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I'm of the view that people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will presumably be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who, in the meantime, lived in the apartment and police said the terror that had inflicted the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
There were ripped open the wooden floorboards in the property where drugs were traded in the past
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting in the street and regularly had to be called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the estate this week after she gave them an extended 11-week deadline to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delogation is always the final step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terribly watching for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have bravely approached us and sent us the information, have done.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation
Workers of the property management will now have to clear away garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police carried out a raid on the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash totalling £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in trade intent.
She claimed the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private property in Plymouth.
Many of the house's room walls were smeared with graffiti.
Police say it will delegate tenants who fail to abide by house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think to themselves that they can behave without self-reproach as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal witnessed the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft put on an incredible crash flight
The air forces said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment when terrified tourists begin to panic after a low-flying jet crashes down a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within reach above the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming towards them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew really very deep over twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility from nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was never at risk at any time.
Landfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, in which four people on the island of Madeira were also killed.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his vision
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super Cup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are struggling to take the first step towards the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans will compete in the duel for the Spanish Super Cup away against FC Sevilla, the return match will be played three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner will have to do without Neymar, among others, in the test of strength with the inferior Cup finalist and ruling Europa League champion, who will contest the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament sprain in the knee in training, which clarifies the question at Barca, at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been competing for the number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far waived a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Before the first competitive match of the new season, there are doubts at the Spanish champions about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a Test match by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the trial gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Sevilla, in turn, have the 2:3 defeat to digest after extra time in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and are aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The world ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with success in the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final as expected and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title in the sign of the Five Rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the plate, between the sets and in time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés loose on each other in fair competition alone.
“I played the matches so far for my country.”
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang had consequently said.
After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace at the plate and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected rousing match did not develop.
However, enough breathtaking ball changes could be seen.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had contracted a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was in medical treatment afterwards, had to "ultimately" settle for sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had by the way become Olympic fourth in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits 'violent problems' in election campaign
The leadership of U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the multi-millionaire, who usually appears large-scale and self-assured, expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
Having kicked 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
The fault is false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Wobble Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on a par.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Exactly how I have done so far.”
And pushed afterwards: This will be "either successful, or I will take a very very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is okay, said Trump.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is said to have threatened Trump to cut funds in support of his election campaign, should he not be able to present better poll ratings.
Instead, they want to help the Republican candidates for Congress.
Olympics: Brazen fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes face unease after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had said that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team leader of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The world association IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case to seek its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and impersonated Ferguson Rotich, gave up the rehearsal and signed," explained Kenya's Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list for training checks.
Ferguson Rotich had finished fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been pulled off from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against cash payments.
He is said to have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
When announcing the more than 2000 doping target checks put up by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular would be targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
Subsequently, WADA took Kenya off the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's track athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a number of television reports of the ARD, allegations have been repeatedly made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athletics.
It could be proven that in this sport was doped nationwide and systematically.
Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespearean year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classical and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their tempo and tune.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with wistfulness her love affair with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She's very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his gaze, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important in general!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly up-to-date: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was suspected to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing in this is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane heading towards Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months became a widow.
Reid says Clinton will remain at Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court in case of election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination were lackeys and aid worker of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for president.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from old-school playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nudeness, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the calendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person on open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-related Foundation Dialogue and the World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Because of the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," Ali Toprak, the association's chairman, told the Welt newspaper.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey.
After the foiled coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start afresh in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that accepts refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The association chief called for the federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is taking place.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition activists.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculars," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation for Dialogue and Education, told the Welt newspaper.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already made up the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany recognized for political persecution before the coup.
As of the deadline of 30. In June, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as asylum-entitled (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of prospects.
The asylum according to the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted persons.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it can't be stupider than before: summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting votes, are only difficult to find.
Until the 4. September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again campaign narrowly pass the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalition-worthy.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is making an almost unremarkable election campaign, apart from his big posters.
He travels around the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendaryly barren predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's blossoming.
Their refugee policy, their "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained recently in the NDR.
But it also hurts no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert thinks, only plays a "minor role".
The Union has also noticed that it is crumbling away from the base in the countryside, that it has to make a great effort to find a connection to the people again.
Like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the far reaches of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn the holiday hardship into a modern virtue and move their election campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," state chairwoman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners go in search of traces for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and finds it still beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 renovation: Restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished.
There is everywhere praise for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and do not end until around 8pm.
"They did everything pretty jagged," Elvira tells Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved south at the beginning of the week at half-time, by the end of October everything should be ready.
The concession of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift entrances.
Since the construction site migrated south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel the B 27 from Ofterdingen again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be receding.
"There were some considerable complaints," says Florian King, deputy head of the main office responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise, because many sneak paths were looking for and more familiar to their navigation than the signage.
Which caused some trucks to fray in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant overruns," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was with 77 kilometers per hour in the tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales slumps in them, lets everyone you ask, see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
If you have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, the renovation has hardly any consequences for you.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "most slight decline" at the car dealership Maier, but also admits that, of course, "the running customer base is missing."
The most bagged are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existentially threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had it "hard hit".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
He puts the revenue losses at "well over 50 percent."
The road renovation had thrown his operation "back by two years."
He had to fire half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been laid off, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant otherwise benefits from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.
In all the lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now stop by less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
Laws are constantly being screwed on in the name of counterterrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As interior minister, however, he was interested in results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has let a little time pass after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security agency should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies also comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship to button the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
Some of them have it in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more opportunities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are brought to the country in a targeted manner should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally delicate.
Some things still seem unsophisticated and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of the tolerated, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that kept people deeply occupied could not be excluded even in election campaign times.
Internal security has come into enormous focus.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns coming up.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
First a nasty dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also demand a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling for conciliatory tones.
He thinks nothing of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them doesn't make sense.
And in a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be revealed.
There's a lot in it that could make for a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to distinguish itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still getting through smoothly.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But it is not in all markets that is running smoothly.
In the recall, there are swirls around a term.
Volkswagen is starting deliveries more cautiously into the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest carmaker has continued to show a plus in the course of the year so far, despite the diesel affair, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, again burdening the overall sale, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also weighed on, explained a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
The mainstay for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still mildly due to the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to book.
Group Sales Director Fred Kappler was able to continue to show an increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issued the customer after the conversion a "guarantee" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in company circles.
The reason is legal intricacies.
The “Focus” had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
From the Department of Transportation, it was confirmed that this meeting took place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) declared, according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration will take place in the event of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type approval will continue to exist.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "guarantee," as it was said in corporate circles.
With the wide term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers can get into a workshop half a year after the conversion, for example, with engine damage - and could rely this back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the customer interest, too, it is important to avoid that in the case of any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, there is uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
That's why VW doesn't use the term "guarantee."
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require high-rich savers to pay penalty interest in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in checking or daily allowance accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers would "not have to fear to pay for their savings penny penalty interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund will charge this fee back from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros in current or daily allowance accounts from September.
“The first 100,000 euros is free.”
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit.
"These are with me in the central bank account and incur 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
“I can’t put down 4000 euros for every million.”
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four robberies, I do not want the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Very few migrated to other banks.
The cooperative association Bavaria declared: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
Wearing them alone is "not possible in the long term in the business sector."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits of three million euros from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines in 2014 with its Skatbank branch.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay nationwide fees for deposits, the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong for that."
One banker said there was "a clientele at Lake Tegernsee that is somewhat more lavishly equipped by the assets."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if she is guarding money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association Bavaria "is currently not aware of any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative against the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce, and there is a threat of the churn of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the wide range.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Middle-aged lonely men love records.
Before you rush to the comment part to cover it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllELonelyMenMiddle age, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are, in all likelihood, between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It's also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53% and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%.
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and wildly studding before I stop, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent vendors were once based - there are still a handful of fantastic slab special stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around 20), is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess I do," he says.
I have ca. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record business offers a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that is so with a lot of people.
It's an easy way to get involved mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member flutes out from a stack of plates.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while scrolling through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just recently came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are just getting in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colourful audience than I walk in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but gnawing psychological traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for several minutes, looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a window shopping trip than a bulk shopping.
She doesn't earn much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she drifts off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be sampling the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just purely decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "record art."
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain.
It's no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even though my research revealed that YouGov’s findings are right, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums disregarded.
These people presumably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record shops and scrolling through plates while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, 30-year-old false presenter towering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - Video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional shops where people within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or sell simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also stated that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people doing the 72 provisional business, but acknowledged that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lagers, which is run for non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympics disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to let himself be subdued.
"I continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable 12th place on the Sugarloaf.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to calmly analyze what reasons led to the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to take a close look at everything we’ve changed recently.”
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-final
Laura Siegemund's victory ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world rankings-32nd from Metzingen missed through a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to bring her serve through once and looked powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met Britain's Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games were last in 1992.
Never before has a German duo stood in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend – Microsoft also wants to benefit from that.
The technology group is buying the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam did not launch with its offer until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can abandon missions and face enemies and provide equipment to players.
The giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle in Washington, are moving to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi announced.
For the customers, therefore, nothing should change as a result of the takeover.
Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch had been bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's parent Alphabet.
Here is the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s speeders must adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested, which are intended to transfer speed sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident focal points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to the time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer in the ramped-up state with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, incidentally, also bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and has now also been used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK pick up silver in 7th rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain's impressive performance at 7's rugby came to an abrupt hold in the final on Thursday night at the final at the final in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, trailing, line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' significant defeat, 7-5 in the same-day semi-final, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at its best at that form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but probably won't it - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks bounce off GB's out of fun.
It felt to captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into moving buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau pied over in the corner.
With four minutes of playing time left, Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right-hand corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou squeaked through further weak tackles by the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
It's like that.
GB made fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long gone in favour of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the final seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked crushingly into the turf.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork, scoring a goal in the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to row victory by battle with the coach's cancer
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was just the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all-present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the twosome without a helmswoman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he was able to begin his treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital running around on the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't out to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did as well.
The couple will take time out for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took around six months to realise that I'm an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
Provided clarity for 31 years in an exemplary manner
The managing director of the water association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the big water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Lower Franconia government paid tribute to the special purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered "as exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of staff for 31 years in the special purpose association, 28 of them as managing director.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, produces about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and towns.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water manager in 1985 and was already appointed managing director of the special purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget preparation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairwoman said.
She cited the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), purchases of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There was no standstill and innovations have been taken up again and again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of passion for his water association and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water steward and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the special purpose association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the pipe break at the high container near Kirchlauter on a 3. January.
Here, it will have to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized in her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at Milan's Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship crime in Bargteheide - man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at around 10.45am on Friday in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and stated to have shot his significant other," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly searched.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 metres tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a bald head.
Police have since released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald head.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship act."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not initially want to give any information about the course of action or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, it confirmed that a person had been killed.
“It’s a homicide.”
"That's all we say at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operations commando (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity funding are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge in the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really glad that we were finally able to achieve that after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers, who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cash register.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ there was now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced, an EEG surcharge of 20 percent would be incurred.
But even this is not raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on own electricity generation.
This largely stipulates the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful effort is of particular importance for the steel industry.
“With regard to our ‘Steel is future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
“More must follow.”
"In the case of the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets must also be weighed up," explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation intensified further when the world’s largest producing country, China, threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry prime minister Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual plants.
Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, the business association Stahl announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, spirit, health: Singing does seniors good
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher training studies she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular gathering, seniors can make and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also had this experience in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.
Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly demand your lungs, you will not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often combined with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-sick people revent long-ago events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special way, explains Lenz.
At the same time, to focus on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone, practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing yourself: If I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, you should not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found over the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats are more sensitive than hangovers to cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meow did not leave the males cold either - but they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of arousal of cat babies in the meowing of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who feel in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have found.
Cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between meowing less and strongly aroused young animals are either not perceptible to the males or are of no importance," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight cats from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
They were played, on the one hand, shouts of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, responded to the screams in a differentiated way," Konerding said.
They turned around to the loudspeaker faster when this calls of the very more aroused kittens played out.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Super Cup with 'Gala'
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Super Cup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even with the imposition of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, the government asserted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed for the attempted coup.
This is not stopped even before football.
The prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
The Sükür, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy watches" in public squares across the country declared Erdogan finished on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With cup winner "Gala" it will be particularly important again on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne team proved its sporting value last season: With 17 goals and nine submissions in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatic" cheered him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He has finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champions came to a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only enough to rank sixth.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win anything.
"We managed to do that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 goals of the season as a Süper-Lig top scorer king the base to the 14th. Title laid.
That's also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
The AC Florence, under contract and only on loan to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt, not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European Championship holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the trade magazine "Kicker" quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
But the striker would have to be prepared to forgo about a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Yulia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Juliya Yefimova, who had sued her right to start just before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 metres chest).
It offered itself a whimsical scenery: with a smile put on, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it was clear that she would not fetch gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.
But there are numerous other athletes who compete in the Olympic Games in Rio despite the doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the world number one over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit out a six-month suspension in 2010 after being proven to have taken the painkiller oxycodone.
She had a severe toothache after an operation, defended the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, world champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowing intake and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world so far over 200 and 400 m.
Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently stripped of so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to surrender Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title for testosterone abuse.
He received the also revoked bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a ruling by the International Court of Sport CAS.
With 80.04 m, he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favorite did not test positive until May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the suspension of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was mild and ran on the 13th. July off.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it.
She had planned her journey home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded on Thursday evening in a nightlife district.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb blast was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular bathing beach Patong, according to police.
In Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, another bomb then exploded that killed a municipal employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive device went up in a flower bed in front of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured.
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin is expected, it said.
"The bombings bear the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We assume it is a coordinated attack.”
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities have received intelligence in recent days of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and the places.
It is still unclear which group was behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officers across the country to step up security around key government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
Hua Hin has a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is not recommended that unnecessary travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This grants the military great influence also in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, considers itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels, which has been simmering in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were also killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'identitarian movement' indications for aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order," constitutional protection chief Hans-Georg Maaßen told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
This is why we are now watching the movement as well.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
She opposes "multicultural madness," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation."
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians."
Maaßen said his authority had coordinated closely with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," the constitutional protection chief said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
Islamists and right-wing extremists would do that.
This is not a betuchable advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its targeting and thus become extremist by certain people who are extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have controlling influence over the party.
This is not recognizable.
With a view to the significant increase in right-wing-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee shelters or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults were the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
“So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or have voted for the CDU, SPD or left, for example, who have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist sentiment.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
On social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his run-up with a backlog of 48 seconds and finished the 59th. Place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still competing in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special starting right by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming better known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habete just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media outlets described him as the "Robel of the Whale."
In reference to a "belly of prosperity," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the run of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a run-up to 100 meters of freestyle.
Frenetically, Moussambani was cheered on at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsried woman had left her business at around 5.30pm on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned at around 8.15 a.m. the next morning, about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the looming election defeat so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Florida.
Should it become nothing with the election as US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he would not care: "Ultimately, it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with U.S. television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, said Trump.
This is how he called U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance has recently formed.
Post enters the trade in electric vans
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post Office plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle as well.
The company plans to start trading in the van shortly.
The Post Office intends to offer its electric vans on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," a Post spokesman said Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other companies.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said there were always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based group intends to soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and is targeting a complete changeover to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he had said in late July.
I can imagine that we are changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership steps down after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him fail.
Turmoil at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a new start in personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already departing with effect from the 12th. September from the Supervisory Board.
The management of the Executive Board will take over as early as 1. September, the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company announced.
He is to officially take over the function of "board spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company cited "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the disappointment of the further absence of the restructuring initiated years ago had been great among the shareholders.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"However, the fruits of the restructuring are yet to be seen even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually become uneasy.
"If that were the case with BMW, so would the Quandts," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
Based on the first half of the year, sales of €721.2 million shrank by 3.4 percent.
Profit in the second quarter was particularly affected by the company's decline in value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of €139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, brought the Group a loss of €148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into ditch in crooked horns: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her information, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to dodge an oncoming truck, which partly drove on the opposite road.
The bus came to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
Firefighters freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an emergency medical vehicle came to the scene of the accident on the state road 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken by a scheduled bus back to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of wastewater are from 1. October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an overwhelming calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was found when the budget was approved by the district office Kulmbach that undercovers are accrued for these wastewater plants.
Due to the legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.
From 1. In October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Administrative Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market municipality was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases by the fact that all three wastewater plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater base, which ranges between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is declining slightly.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three plants incurred to a considerable extent, not least because of their age, renovation and repair expenses.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater plant due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch and at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were the updated care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low wastewater in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "fully impact".
Schmidt added, the market community has been spared from large maintenance costs at the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be expanded to include these facilities because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria posts inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged, as in the previous month, for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education unchanged.
Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that is already bordering on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, property-wraving tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps are leaked to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage went widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter was reminiscent of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly opposed the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American arts student whose tweet was widely disseminated about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injuring and to say the least unpleasant."
She added that "it was difficult to argue with juxtaposing a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filtering effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the derogatory extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company to cross these cultural trip wires.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that's offensive to a user, "it's much harder that things like this go unnoticed than it used to," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account prompted others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believed racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in her workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable, to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat left mostly unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resources officer focused on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not O.K."
Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence, Congressional Committee Notes
United States Central Command military personnel altered intelligence to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called. Drawing Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional inquiry committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Command, Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, which was typically nodded off by senior Centcom commanders, regularly painted a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analysis is presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom extend to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report highlights detailed ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, said in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's peaks changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on Islamic State.
The report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are ongoing.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday that were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said Adam B, a member of the House of Representatives. Ship, known in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaging morale among analysts and "gave excessively little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of White House intervention at Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of Congress' investigation were released Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on any reports from Congress while the inspector general's investigation was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then-Government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupying force in Iraq and little time was spent thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. According to government agencies, Hooker noted that contrary to government statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they would have put temporary refineries into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, that finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was placed at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel replaced.
The US wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is imminent
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3-0.
Five goals in two games was supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who remembers their gates.
However, she knows this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on par in their group with the British women in first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first-place finisher will avoid the strong Dutch women a little longer, who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the American women have sparked a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at three years old had a hockey stick in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she failed to qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and with that, things began to turn for the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to take the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the match with a backhand strike from close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and limped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who has so far had to score one goal each in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of Saturday's next game.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a frenzied relay race between competition and pursuit.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod served from crossbow shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffe shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among those well-known names broadcast at prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I might modestly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the trampoline's discreet charm.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the past 16 years that many who, I had interviewed, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that for the women.
Dong Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics for the unenlightened ear.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means "springboard."
Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to take a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."
Twinty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls have to go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the starting wall, but in the television broadcast also another sneering goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even move a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I find a bit tiring even when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite of this.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is on top.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no bulging into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the gagging and objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-wrestling, new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses testify that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets demanding fundamental policy changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, presumably from last year or earlier this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or jail, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and these have no other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the opposition's last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden's National Liberation Front, which has been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of simmering beneath the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublicized disease in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at perceiving early signs of discontent and using special envoys to work opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear the outcome will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were seemingly bogged down by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this period of riots passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal disfavor.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked business in Gondar, an Amharic city, by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin balancing act."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday attempted to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by specifying that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group had not been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidates’ communication skills as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow soldiers, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant.
After making the insinuation at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump back in relation to Thursday's claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump, he's just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the allegation perfectly serious.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help mitigate the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism slams on Mr. Trump down while trying to turn the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling poll ratings.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump to return to this issue again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should have Mrs. Clinton's emails hack, but he later declared "Of course I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump pushing the language boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" according to what the reaction turns out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll ratings have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published Friday, showed a leadership with a large lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump in general is trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes put his loyal fellow soldiers in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani, therefore, he on the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements were questioned about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely false and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the administration under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowing ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively bring the situation in the Middle East under control.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continues his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He scorned the "poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just further proof that he was unfit for president.
Once pushed over price from the market, cafe in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as a last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, it's reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers.
"A lot of old customers were also ousted by awards from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was because of the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudges that the soap business took the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the soap offered Cherie to make a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still go into her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon, making his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice restaurant wants to bottle the cold-brewed coffee and sell it.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said entering the eatery and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, as dessert, a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman tells in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, no-frills takeaway in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive bits, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found this fitting for a discussion of food in the Great Depression era.
"Rich food was very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pâté was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the paths with which the country dealt with no longer being the land of squirrels.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food scraps," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unsavory ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focal point of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange blends were tried out because a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
Ziegelmann goes on to say, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country's eating habits of this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and live up to the challenge of turning pamp like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic treats.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens are tasty, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Cake-Food attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he was dining like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and was wearing a tuxedo.
He was gloriously unrealistic.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleak prepared.
Many of the species from the Great Depression era of dealing with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated to have understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law better - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone, somewhat reluctantly, dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a lookup three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets," a civil defense group that has so far saved nearly 60,000 people's lives, according to Bild newspaper.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to draw people from bombed-out homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian gunman showing him from the rubble of a house in an 11-hour rescue of an infant went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war.
However, as a hero, he has never seen himself, according to Bild, "For me, this is the real Jihad."
“When I die saving lives, I think God sees in me a martyr.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing raids in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.
This slow-focused lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" anyway about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the sea of ice off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know accordingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Prey make these sharks anyway: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting dormant animals or patrolling at the bottom of the sea of ice and looking for carcasses that stork downwards from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen brought in from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the sharks' lens core.
This center of the eye lens arises even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons trials hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, however, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to be its 50 in its investigation in 2012. Have celebrated birthday.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon 14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 o'clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark at 502 centimeters is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only have offspring when they are longer than four metres.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be at least a century and a half with the propagation.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrate animals at the moment.
That such methusalems live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a saving flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.
Building ground in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the local council focused on issues relating to construction.
With relief, the panel took up Mayor Robert Putz's announcement that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential building space can begin."
After the land, parcelling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and sleek seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can now report to the town hall, the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with inquiries about the settlement of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-areas, which was only newly drawn up in the spring of this year.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, the industrial area already designated there will be expanded by two plots towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The City of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies that have been moved from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to continue operating financial transactions across the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been sufficient for admission in the UK.
This is what large U.S. banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced plans to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, speaks the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance regulator EIOPA and the risk council ESRB.
Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but is doing worse in terms of infrastructure, just like Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it's not that easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of the management consultancy Mercer, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg in 19th place, Dublin in 33rd place and Paris 37. Place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
But London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit votes, the economists say.
According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015, compared to 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. incumbent ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it from the Hepatits C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation payment for the infringement of two patents by Merck, which were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of wrongdoing by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to remission of the costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to equalize with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have retaken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State militants in the city left it, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council Reuters.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are currently carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which revealed an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former secretary of state reported an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's nominee for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, is publishing his tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backsliding regarding his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic presidential presidential nominee's release.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything before the tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions regarding wealth, his donations to charity, his business conduct and various other connections, particularly Russia.
Clinton has already pounced on the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday calling on high-ranking Republicans Trump to release his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid little or very little tax during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday that said that might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, calling on Trump to exchange their tax returns for a meeting.
Buffett said he was also subject to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump was "fearful" of voters rather than the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has returned tax returns to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about. 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx. 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return showed that they only raised USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike the bulk of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $109,000.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to stop elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms at them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we have been... Having developed toolkit, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, being much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant in the process," said the managing director of honey guide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not quenched, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts open with a bang and sprays fine dust on chilipuder into the air.
A touch, usually, already out to chase away the elephant.
One last option is a launcher that shoots a gold rainy fireworks display in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on St. Goar Rhine bank
Usually the St. Goar investment project of traders with a kissing hand on - the retail sector in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine River in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli primary was removed after "Arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli primary, as Arab guests had "requested" it, according to a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country's country rehearing list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the primary election be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the internet where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given in" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is located near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the allegations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the quick diallist," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police deploy tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to dismiss her.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upswing was achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian mission abroad issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Witnesses wanted: Drinks market in Waldbröl raided
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the aid of a firearm, three darkly dressed persons, who had hooded their faces, demanded the surrender of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW Golf.
How much money was captured, the police do not inform.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
The perpetrators must have run after the raid in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking lot opposite the parking lot with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (at around 19:45), which are related to the robbery, should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
The children and young people of the social education day group/social group of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold spent eight days with their caregivers on their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located leisure home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
For one thing, we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special guided tour of children in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited you to jump, swim and splash.
Children and carers were spoiled with their self-prepared favourites such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, baked, beautiful pieces of jewelry were created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the journey home the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrants from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna was on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of Rome of all ministers in probably two years, the senior ministerial round St. Anna determined to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the episcopal city of Freiburg was ultimately decided, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy at Freiburg Cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.
The night before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb, they took the train to the starting point Villingen, where a cathedral of Our Lady also stands and so the pilgrimage was started by the cathedral.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.
But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches stopped again and again to sing a song together from specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays, parish halls of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and fortifying dinner and breakfast at the stage destinations.
We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day the stage was taken to St. Peter an, which was the most strenuous route, had to descend in sultry heat first about 500 meters of altitude and then be climbed again.
The reward deserved was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburg Cathedral in the later afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in the cathedral, the minis arriving at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scots Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced. The youngster made the legend proud when he stormed home to claim a win from favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place finish at the World Rail Championships in London in March despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the front-runner Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman who has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy accounted for much of the transformation, where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC pundit and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time around.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands."
We've come together as a team over the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
That's an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress over the past five months, that's what successful five days await us at the velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also on 23. March was born (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same from Hoy.
Kenny next participates in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always at its best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued with appointees before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and finish tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced to 4:13,260 in world record time.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a gaggle of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas played out in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition at the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland's smelting plant questionable due to cancellation of energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminium meltdown in Victoria – as well as hundreds of jobs of workers – is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award further subsidies to operate the facility.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland facility are at stake.
No fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk if closed.
In addition, it could lead to domino effects, as the smeltering industry consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company said in a statement.
AGL also testified that the contracts were so-called "back-up transactions" that should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impact on revenues on AGL from FY 18 onwards is currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not interfere with the "ability to operate Alcoas... the smeltering or ensuring power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it still owes an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic conditions.
Referring to the analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as power generators, that wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-sided most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they have forgotten their sister's cover and that ends with a classic twist.
That represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we'd forgot you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting station at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scope more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the tomber, 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, images of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" have been on the cover.
Oscar-winning actress and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she finds herself in good company.
These celebrities aren’t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, one-time Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
Those feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to be passing the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises her primer of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she can be seen on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister, Kourtney, and her children.
Municipal law centres dismiss 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's most aided are turned away annually by the community law centres, while the industry is gearing up for the impact of further funding cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of acts of violence and those who have no means for unjust delogations and the like - are already turned away in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively busy, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, it is envisaged that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the community law centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already turned away each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through breakups, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Queensland Senators, George Brandis, to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centres and their customer communities, and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly drew gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had pointed a firearm at an employee in February while travelling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini claimed to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing "that would not happen."
The campaign director, Earl Philip, "drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd of North Carolina that the "Second Amendments people" - firearms owners and gun friends - should take action should his rival Hillary Clinton be elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign clarified that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint claims damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for assault and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
No response was made to calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4. September) and Berlin (18. September) are looming significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black ruling coalition could govern narrowly further in the north, this is not possible according to the poll ratings in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party would only be slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the state parliament.
The Greens are moving back into the Schwerin state parliament despite slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only be 23 percent in the Berlin election (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates would, on the other hand, in contrast to 2011, miss the entry.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on the 15th August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the vest pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although excruciatingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be opened similarly to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 Deutschmark, so about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold to Microsoft and wounding up.
Today, the market is dominated by providers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and everywhere is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million.
Worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunication companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple’s triumphal march began, and the iPhone is still the company’s most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the go-ahead.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry is struggling.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, responsible for personnel on the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but across the country.
For me, that represented Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was back in London in 2012, when we put in a huge effort to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will happen again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I've been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we'll embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in educational growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2 built in the midst of the world's two busiest catwalks.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 have been a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and Mouse Game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post in which it said users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it harder to identify ad blocking recognition of which part of the site advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to get around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams's spokesperson wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the runderers has already been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it's possible for Facebook to come soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study from last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems worthwhile to invest such a move.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt remedy, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were hit by several cars, police in Vaud testified.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said police, who are calling on them, as well as any witness to the incident, to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark was running on the highway - it was decided that motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a female police officer of negligent homicide was acquitted after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and fell unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that a man's presence on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about Thursday's incident near Morges should report to police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus's past using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, might once have exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus.
The planet presumably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exposes its day side to the sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, which resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus, who as we know her today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative president/general manager of Colorado's Joe Sakic confirmed that decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determinacy," Roy said in a statement.
I've thought about long and a lot over the course of the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, that it needs it and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions that influence the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, the Roy on 23. Had hired in May 2013, thanking him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of that decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed out on the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor disputes regarding pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute sit down at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," it said in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day sessions over the next few weeks, which will start early next year to re-address the issues.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has laid off thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-combination with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had intensified by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that had been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades' star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades' star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate in the cluster at different rates and what the rotation periods with planet formation are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which formed around 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about which we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star steps down
The tears went faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in prime days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will be on the 12th. August against the Tampa Bay Rays wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I'll say 'Goodbye' to both," the 14-time All-Star Game participant from Major League Baseball (MLB) declared.
Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31. December 2017 he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he managed some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players feature similar scores in key statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is unlikely to be included in the baseball's hall of fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his demeanour outside the pitch.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to having taken banned steroids on "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to a tangle in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect of having received performance-enhancing funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the suspension was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done me a favour for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends get the big stage once again in their final games, Rodriguez frequently had to sit on the bench.
“My job doesn’t include a farewell tour.”
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi etched.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be dealing with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy from fans of Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat to the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil and ruled out - immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, this news comes at an untimely time.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was already detected last Sunday.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the run-ups over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a message: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive rehearsal at Danekova leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is said to have already turned out positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been ruled out."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-incriminated nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the "Adrian Zielinski" case was also announced, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier.
Both dispute the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekova case in particular is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian team, with one exception, because of systematic doping the start, also the runner nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang is peeing purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also the focus of an argument with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit out a three-month suspension.
Data theft: How perfidiously, hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in the process.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with blackmail software at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, increasingly in attacks on company networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom to be potentially extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the switch to company attacks has taken place in recent months terrifyingly fast.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, she searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the end-key code to the files, victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is at a standstill.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business activity, in one case, people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks on several occasions, the patients of which can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you just promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
Yet 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."
More likely, however, are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software builder.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"Included is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better back up their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to ward off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful extortion, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the damage potential is still many times higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get an internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom to many a victim.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, looks rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not look tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-crafted and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l available at high and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering, however, is likely to be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane-keeping assistant.
The collision warning is sometimes irritated because it evaluates many obstacles as "approximate objects" when manoeuvring.
The high beam assistant is very reliable.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles speed when needed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers that are typical for air traffic, argued the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: When does the organizer pay
Patients only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without a doubt.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness attributed the holidaymakers to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was thus deficient - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The wastewater treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure of the plaintiffs.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was fine.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the ruling.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - is part of the general risk to life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must respond calmly and decisively at the same time to terror threats.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this increases security and also strengthens the approval of the population for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve an implementation of the proposals by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced another staff reinforcement of the security forces, "in the mid-four-digit order of magnitude over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is to be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently much-discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained, according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the danger to citizens, he said, with a view to psychological abnormalities.
To counteract a radicalisation of refugees, the minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière is planning to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increasing security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a slap for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously denied calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate energy and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly builds up on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But that is to change: the right turn lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when driving over the motorway feeder (A 43).
The state road construction company will extend next Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17. August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße the right turn lane by 700 meters.
Motorists can then thread directly from Hammer Straße on the right.
The big advantage: traffic is split earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The roadway narrowing on the feeder annoys motorists especially between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backwater extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the eye of the needle on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only steered in one lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled a good three-quarter years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load-bearing capacity to take up heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will last, the responsible state company can not say.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official remaining useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right turn lane, the state company has deliberately selected the weaker time in the school holidays, because disabilities are to be expected.
Traffic will be passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane.
Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's association and the Junges Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a presentation of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbare Haus" by the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 attended the staging in the Kleiner Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the youths in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were nevertheless able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junges Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration background between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are planned.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has put a dash through the bill for the shooting star-shooters in southwest Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to observe the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will certainly see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the alarm ringing.
This is anything but restful.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently perceive their sleep as not restful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep-in and sleep-through disorder.
Many people find sleeping through it as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Family Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially in the case of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are mutually dependent.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and may start to think about everyday problems and worries, Weess gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired during the day, you should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look very different: you are cut off, tired, unsleep, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
To relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, Weeß advises.
He can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's going on?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with respiratory failures, in the case of pathological daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't take a nap," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nasal glasses, a chest strap and a probe on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can put on for a better sleep.
Weess counts on: Regular bedtimes and getting up, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and this is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself protective in front of his criticized ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets €20,000 and a jungle king 150,000 €, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night to Friday.
The support system in swimming is poor, while the doping controls are very good.
With this, we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely or even operate on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that the checks are to be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch by the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is exactly how it should be kept with countries.

Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
At around 21:30, civilian officers in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the policemen from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year and had proceeded community-based, part-time and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Investigation Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had captured a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like it at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
On the facade of a gray house, someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, on the ground floor, however, rooms are still occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel in particular had repeatedly advocated a crackdown by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 a starting point for autonomous violence.
After on the 22. June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patroled for three weeks according to official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, cordoned off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On the 13th July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers pulled away under the cheers of sympathizers and local residents.
This summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of the Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the home projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a neighborhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandaling leftists.
The moat that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between squatters and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the residential projects born from them have also long been part of the neighborhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Riga.
While the Mainzer had been cleared under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhood with them.
This is also evident in the case of rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by thrown-in discs or freshly painted facades, which have been pelted with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the offences account for property damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated homes.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, she is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in the Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Riga Street - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the sovereignty of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-heeled live here," she says.
“I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction.”
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For newcomers who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine Kunde from the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolly milk sow, which has a problem above all else.
Thus, some - less mocking than rather aimed at the multitude of desirable areas of responsibility - had meant when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying woolly milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been at it for around six weeks.
She has a 50 percent job limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are problems big and small, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The costs of building, renting or renovation of these shelters must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private housing.
It does not work so far, but you are dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.
Therefore, community housing must be upgraded, as it is so nicely called.
So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße.
But only with housing it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent place to stay, it is internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and that motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive outside impact.
This is "not occupational therapy."
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers also jump in here.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach, must not work and is useless, will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says Kunde honestly, "people who are not working at all." The work of Deuschle and Kunde is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: After the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde very clearly, "which some may call naive." However, a residual risk cannot and should not exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also an issue among the refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So full-time and volunteers have to look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
Answering this question clearly is what politics shy away from.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people reasonably.
This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars wanted by helicopter
The police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men violently entered an apartment in an apartment building in the Lindenweg at around 8.50am on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and slammed the unholds into the run.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres tall, arguably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards the city centre.
For the manhunt, the police deployed several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter.
The search went without success.
Possibly the unknowns noticed before the fact near the apartment or in their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on snack bar
After an attack on an Ulm snack bar, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breach of land peace.
During apartment searches, evidence and drugs had been secured, the police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rocker-like group had thrown bottles and stones against the shop window of a snack bar in July, according to police.
After that, they are said to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
After that, they fled.
Damage to the snack bar and the adjacent building amounted to 10000 euros.
According to the investigators, it is about a dispute in the Ulm rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
