Diego Cocca becomes new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada, with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the job until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked anger within the club.
Geesthacht: New flower bed signs encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) place the plant signs in the flowerbeds of the pedestrian zone.
The &quot;Geesthacht is blooming&quot; campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. &quot;Geesthacht is blooming&quot; is a campaign by the NABU in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. The goal: to create large flower islands in the Geesthacht city area where insects can find food at any time. &quot;When the weather is good, the bees fly out in January to look for food,&quot; says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht NABU. He himself has beehives on his property.
To ensure that the project does not remain just an action by conservationists and the city&#39;s environmental department, but also reaches far into private gardens, explanatory signs are put up about the plants. There are around 50 signs so far. This way, passers-by can find out what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately replant them at home.
The Wildhasel season started in the first week of January
More recently, shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter viburnum have been planted in the flowerbeds in the pedestrian zone. They have been in the soil of the pots on Bergedorer Strasse for a year now, are leafless and are just showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink, and have recently been given additional signs. &quot;The winter-scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide,&quot; it says, along with further information on a suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe stresses that it is not just the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. The wild hazel season already started in the first week of January. It is blooming particularly profusely on Richtweg near the gradient, in Gutenbergstrasse, Wilhelm-Holert-Strasse, Fahrendofer Weg and in many hedgerows.
Ernestine is 102 years old: &quot;Steppes keep me young&quot;
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of you if he looked down from heaven at Munich&#39;s Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday at 3 p.m. sharp, three ladies meet at the &quot;Mandolin Motion Show Academy&quot; for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. &quot;Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can&#39;t imagine life without it.&quot;
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also dance with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today we would call her a musical actress, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. &quot;I have spent my life dancing, acting and singing.&quot;
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something of a youngest among the tap dancers. She says: &quot;We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl.&quot;
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. Two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles used initially, are attached to the front and back of the shoes to create rhythmic sounds that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French term is claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. &quot;We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome here.&quot;
And what is the recipe for such a long life? &quot;Exercise keeps me young,&quot; the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone: &quot;Sport, healthy eating and no alcohol.&quot;
Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With the advance of digitalization, many people are once again becoming interested in analogue
The speed with which our everyday lives became digital left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, you had three options. You were either one of the lucky six percent who had a private phone line. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in your neighborhood and could call your relatives for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a phone booth. I will never forget the smell of the plastic handset and the clicking of the coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person&#39;s face when I made the call - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What&#39;s next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has commissioned former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean was one of the president&#39;s advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced in explanation for her resignation - apparently she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her &quot;enormous sacrifices&quot;.
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, holding 63 of 101 seats. Confirming the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, in recent months, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, there will be a proper celebration in Veitshöchheim again. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn&#39;t need to be asked twice.
State governor Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria’s Environment and Consumer Protection Minister, Thorsten Glauber, chose the children’s hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came from the depths of the sea to Franconia.
Completely off the rails: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
State Parliament President Ilse Aigner chose none other than “Mama Bavaria” as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria&#39;s Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder aka Construction Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria&#39;s golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at the carnival: Bavaria&#39;s Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side is his wife Gerswid.
On the road: Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be left out either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD parliamentary group leader&#39;s passion: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen went royal. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was out and about as a mime. His wife Andrea was at his side.
If politics doesn&#39;t work out, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg&#39;s mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
On the move like a bee: Bavaria&#39;s Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR&#39;s legal director, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A little dig at climate activists from Franconian crime scene detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was also there: Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 world championship titles and is catching up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 world championship gold medals. Even heavy fog at times did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday he had already successfully defended his title with Norway&#39;s mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that the third chase race will follow. Bö is once again the clear favorite in the pursuit. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate for shooting errors with alarming ease to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, things weren&#39;t going well for Doll again. After the veteran had wasted all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty lap in the mixed relay and only managed sixth place, things didn&#39;t go any better three days later. Three penalty laps in the prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago, he won in Hochfilzen by a hair&#39;s breadth, just 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Doll, who has been on the podium once this winter. The eighth-place finisher at the Beijing Olympics left without saying a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees managed to finish 19th, and the second World Championship debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: &quot;We must stand up for democracy&quot;
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will focus on the value of democracy. Both will look back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
&quot;The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test,&quot; Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. &quot;We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength.&quot; Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: &quot;Brazil has isolated itself for four years.&quot;
The left-wing politician Lula prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro&#39;s supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently entered parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not care much about international relations. &quot;His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and night,&quot; said Lula. &quot;Sounds familiar,&quot; Biden replied - an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed members of the Red Army Faction who were being denounced and shot.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, this was a public way of stirring up sentiment against the most dangerous enemies of the Federal Republic of Germany; let&#39;s say bourgeois democracy, let&#39;s say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous people in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more interested in hooligans on the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is publishing a new edition with the &quot;war criminal&quot; Putin&#39;s friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world that includes Asia, Africa and Latin America, there are perhaps more &quot;friends of the Russians&quot; than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that is not the point. Rather, Ms Wagenknecht is in first to fifth place (!), followed by Ms Schwarzer.
Well, I don&#39;t know anyone in my area who reads this paper anymore. If they did, it would be high time. We have reached the level we know, where nothing is below that.
And now, dialectically speaking, Ms Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all people who have not yet gone completely stupid, that is, peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is necessary anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler&#39;s lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper and RTL in the same words. It says: &quot;I can confirm that my client has submitted an application to the relevant court to dissolve his civil partnership via his family lawyer. I will not comment on the details.&quot;
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, and there had been rumors of a separation for about a year. After participating in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In 1999, a memorial center was set up in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the national order of merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned for Franco-German youth meetings, among other things.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ series North Lippe hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, the residents find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even return straight away.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate increases are &quot;absolutely&quot; necessary in the fight against high inflation. &quot;The inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs could easily rise again, and China&#39;s opening up could also give prices a temporary boost,&quot; Sewing told &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the eurozone for the fifth time in a row and announced a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the eurozone is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher loan interest rates can lead to investments being postponed and thus economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy. &quot;The consequences of permanently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries,&quot; said Sewing. &quot;Of course we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently.&quot;
The ECB is aiming for medium-term price stability in the eurozone with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far from being achieved for months. Although price increases weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will &quot;collapse sooner or later,&quot; warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). &quot;I currently see this as the greatest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.&quot;
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung is hoping for a broad debate on the &quot;Germany pace&quot; for infrastructure projects announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). &quot;There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it will perhaps be a bit more controversial,&quot; he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that the end result will be a set of rules that will not necessarily mean things will go as fast as the LNG terminals that came into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to partially close the gap in gas supplies due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new &quot;Germany pace&quot; on the occasion. In addition, the federal government recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
&quot;First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that should not automatically mean that we will always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in our neighbor&#39;s garden against his will,&quot; said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process about what we as a society consider right and wrong.
In the past, they tried to use the classic set of rules and didn&#39;t succeed. &quot;We should think again about whether the previous approach was correct. Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.&quot;
However, given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, Hartung said he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved. &quot;As a consumer of this energy, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible.&quot;
Union warns against breakup of Bayer Group
Following the announcement of a change of management at Bayer, the chemical union IG BCE is warning of a break-up of the company. &quot;From the employees&#39; point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future,&quot; said Francesco Grioli, member of the union&#39;s board of directors and Bayer&#39;s supervisory board, to the &quot;Rheinische Post&quot; (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. &quot;The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism.&quot;
The background to this is the change in management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave his post this summer. The former pharmaceutical boss of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is set to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The takeover of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, which was completed in 2018, still haunts the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes into the house over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer shares were in a downward spiral for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was actually supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had put pressure on him. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off &quot;of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company&#39;s value,&quot; said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the &quot;Rheinische Post&quot;. However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French will once again take to the streets to protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing a government plan with concentrated protests on the streets. Hundreds of thousands of people plan to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate again on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron&#39;s planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the center-right government&#39;s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. A turbulent debate has been going on in parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France already work longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough to receive a full pension when they reach retirement age. Opponents of the reform say that people in many demanding jobs could hardly work longer. Employees also want to be able to enjoy their well-earned pension and not have their health completely worn out by their job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees have to pay for a growing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the level of pensions stable, the population has to work a little more. Critics doubt the government&#39;s calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government doesn&#39;t just want to change the retirement age. The increase in the period of contributions required for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron&#39;s most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was aborted, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were certain for all of them.
Since Macron&#39;s camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support. However, some MPs - even from Macron&#39;s faction - still have reservations. And even more than his fear of a close vote, Macron is probably worried about crippling strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers&#39; sense of responsibility to ensure that they would be peaceful and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
Calm high pressure weather is expected in Germany until at least the middle of the week. &quot;When you look at the weather maps, you immediately notice a powerful high pressure area directly over Central Europe,&quot; explained meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. &quot;This high will move a little eastward over the course of the next week. But it will continue to determine the weather in Germany.&quot;
However, calm high pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. &quot;Such a high pressure can actually be quite mean and can bring dreary, foggy weather to people in the lowlands for days, while up in the low mountain ranges there is pure sunshine.&quot;
Sunday will start foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, there may still be some rain from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. The cloud cover will clear up over the course of the day, particularly on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and parts of the west, and the sun will appear more frequently. In the rest of the country it will remain heavily overcast or covered with high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
&quot;On Monday, the gradually increasing sun will start to nibble away at the high fog and will gradually dissolve it over the course of the day,&quot; says the meteorologist. Sun is expected all day on the edge of the Alps, in the high elevations of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, but elsewhere it will have to fight its way through the high fog. Maximum temperatures will be between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees on the Lower Rhine, but only 3 degrees are expected in the permanent gray of the southeast. There will also be a light wind blowing from various directions.
On Tuesday, there may be only a slow dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be clear once the fog has cleared. According to forecasts, the sun will shine all day in high areas, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps. Temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her elimination in the downhill at the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
&quot;I&#39;m sad because I didn&#39;t perform as well as I can,&quot; said the Italian on ZDF after she got caught in a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was just able to avoid a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races in this discipline so far this season. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky skiing style, will have to wait a while longer for a World Championship medal in her favorite discipline. She was absent from her home race in Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
&quot;I actually thought I was in good shape. It was a matter of hundredths of a second,&quot; said Goggia after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. &quot;I&#39;m disappointed. I gave it my all. But that&#39;s life.&quot; Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all the experts expected and that she ultimately missed out on: &quot;But they aren&#39;t.&quot;

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia&#39;s participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. By demanding the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The Lithuanian Ministry of Sport announced on its website that it had agreed at a joint telephone conference to draw up a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions.
&quot;We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues,&quot; said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. &quot;And I made the UK&#39;s position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue.&quot;
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. &quot;While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,&quot; said Zelenskyy. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and unacceptable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being allowed to compete. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has &quot;unfortunately lost its honesty.&quot;
The conference was prompted by the IOC&#39;s announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to take part.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, subsequently stated that it had also reiterated during the consultations that it would reject the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. &quot;In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC&#39;s efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong approach,&quot; a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told dpa in response to a query.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: &quot;Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum.&quot; Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Russia and Belarus are currently excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for athletes from both countries to return to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently declared that exclusion &quot;because of a passport or place of birth&quot; violates the ban on discrimination.
Chalk it up where it happens
&quot;Hey, great ass!&quot;, whistling at the fool in the tight sexy costume and shouting lewd comments: all of this falls under the term &quot;catcalling&quot;. The term refers to nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow&#39;s tank stocks severely decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow&#39;s tank stocks severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. It says it has lost &quot;half of its main stock.&quot;
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. &quot;Probably half of the main tank inventory&quot; of the Russian army &quot;has been destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine,&quot; said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs in the US Department of Defense.
At an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide any further details on the number of tanks the US estimates had been seized and destroyed.
Ukraine is set to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The USA has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, their delivery is likely to take much longer.
Russia wants to add to its lead
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. &quot;As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, missiles, tanks,&quot; said Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. &quot;It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks.&quot;
A law has been in force in Russia since last summer that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over Army post filling
The position, which will be filled by the former director of the Military History Museum (HGM), Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The Academy&#39;s staff representative, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
An advertisement is not necessary because the appointment is for a previously vacant position, said the minister. She did not want to comment on &quot;speculations by a liberal staff representative&quot;. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum&#39;s handling of Austria&#39;s military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of mobbing. In Tanner&#39;s view, these have been dispelled.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner&#39;s suitability for the subject. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ is demanding that Tanner explain the &quot;unusual appointment process&quot;. The decision has the &quot;appearance of job-swapping&quot;, says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is &quot;still up to its neck in a corruption swamp&quot;, said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defence. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools fall to their knees due to costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia&#39;s carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, including for security, are difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone account for about half of the estimated total costs for the parade.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg. The &quot;Procession of the Happy People&quot; in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany&#39;s largest, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades were cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein&#39;s carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. &quot;We are going ahead with our event,&quot; says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here too, financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors are not found or the current ones donate more, reserves would have to be touched - &quot;that&#39;s not possible every year.&quot; The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In some cases, prices for sweets have risen by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Association. Luckily, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the parade will be more expensive. Security will require twice as many staff as in 2020.
Anyone standing on the side of the road during the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland might get fewer sweets than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some of the parade participants don&#39;t have as many with them. Candy or not, the crowds are likely to be large: &quot;I think that if it doesn&#39;t rain cats and dogs on the day, then we can definitely expect a larger crowd,&quot; says Cologne parade leader Holger Kirsch. &quot;That&#39;s because there hasn&#39;t been a regular Rose Monday parade for two years. Of course, there&#39;s no substitute for the parade.&quot;
The festival committee in Cologne has not commented on the costs in detail. However, it is no secret that the parade is generally &quot;loss-making&quot;.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
It is not without reason that Ukrainians are considered to be good drinkers. There is local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lemberg. I keep discovering German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can&#39;t tell much difference in the taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They distill it here mainly in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. Nobody knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, here too you can see how little you can believe the Russians. They say you should be careful with it as a tourist. But that only applies when it is sold in bulk. That is probably adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for great effort: &quot;Match luck on our side&quot;
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer after work, you will find great places to do so in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-party drinks. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot &quot;Flocke&quot;
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Championship sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to see from the VIP box on Saturday whether the targets on the shooting range were actually falling. &quot;I had to get the results on my cell phone,&quot; admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a grin, referring to the clouds of fog that kept drifting into the stadium, severely impairing the view for spectators on the Rennsteig.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: &quot;I have been fascinated by biathlon since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race,&quot; he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: &quot;The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have been working here since the World Championships were awarded.&quot; In terms of sustainability, the location is now &quot;one step ahead&quot; of many others and is therefore &quot;secure for the next few years and even decades.&quot;
In terms of sport, Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again ran away from the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second world championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind), who shot flawlessly, and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters were unable to get involved in the fight for medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick&#39;s triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after a shooting error and was 1:04.8 minutes behind. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and came twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey veil. In contrast, Benedikt Doll was disappointing again. After his botched mixed performance on Wednesday, the Black Forest athlete left five targets standing this time and disappeared into the locker room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö started the race in front of 14,300 spectators wearing the number 1 and demonstrated this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, he was lucky with his last two standing shots; they both landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: &quot;It&#39;s the best feeling to be here with him,&quot; said the world champion: &quot;We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes.&quot;
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In the women&#39;s race, however, the German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. &quot;When you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. You just have to go full throttle and attack to defend the number one,&quot; said sports director Felix Bitterling, calling on his &quot;locomotive&quot; to take responsibility. The organizers are expecting an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes &quot;swarm of bees&quot; on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on a drop ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany&#39;s referees want to &quot;consistently punish&quot; unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee chief Fröhlich points to the role model function.
Top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative trends in interaction on the field. &quot;I do think that there are new behaviors among the players, who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to force him into the review area,&quot; the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. &quot;We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it.&quot;
Recently, two coaches were also sent off. Mainz coach Bo Svensson was shown the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg coach Christian Streich was shown a yellow-red card in the league defeat in Dortmund. &quot;The coach&#39;s behavior also falls into the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has increased in this area too, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike conduct,&quot; said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that there is generally a good relationship between coaches and referees. &quot;Overall, the relationship is good. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person affected has to live with that. It shouldn&#39;t be anything earth-shattering,&quot; Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
&quot;Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts during the game. But if emotions spill over into personal insults, then you have to accept that the referees will take the appropriate measures,&quot; said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, those involved have cleared things up afterwards. &quot;It would only be important if a process of rethinking was then initiated that this kind of behavior is simply not acceptable,&quot; said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects on another level. &quot;Of course, incidents in professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior,&quot; said Fröhlich. &quot;Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful.&quot;
Nordic combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia came third.
The German Nordic combined athletes will not be competing in the Black Forest with their best team. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not taking part. They are training in Oberstdorf to prepare for the World Championships, which will take place in Planica, Slovenia, from February 21 to March 5. &quot;We have three world-class athletes at home. The team is obviously feeling that,&quot; said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage in the Marl Sculpture Museum
Initiated the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12th, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There will be some extras at the finale.
The finissage for the exhibition &quot;Wandgebunden&quot; will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3 p.m. in the temporary quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In each of the three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals will attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalogue will document the works created especially for the Marl Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-based art in the service of the community. Using numerous examples, she will present the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and examine the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on the mural paintings of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as the art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in buildings in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the last curator&#39;s tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects following the collapse of buildings during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor&#39;s office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at Istanbul airport. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early on Monday morning, an earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow dies
Hans Modrow has died, the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Faction leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a &quot;deeply sincere socialist&quot;.
Last night, &quot;Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95,&quot; the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing &quot;an important personality,&quot; said faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the SED district leadership in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. In the People&#39;s Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The Left Party&#39;s parliamentary group leader, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on Twitter as a &quot;deeply sincere and combative socialist&quot;. Bartsch added:
&quot;He was an important advisor in our party until his old age, and his wisdom will be missed.&quot;
&quot;The entire peaceful process of achieving German unity was a special achievement of his. That will remain his political legacy,&quot; wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary. It continues:
&quot;His later work in the People&#39;s Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated.&quot;
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state &quot;quite critically&quot;. According to dpa, Modrow criticized in many interviews that German unity was achieved too quickly, that the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and that it was condemned too one-sidedly as an &quot;unjust state&quot;.
What happened that night
Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kyiv has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks has forced emergency repairs to the Ukrainian energy network. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzky, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The electricity supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power network, a reactor block at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was reduced at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with around 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. But in a video message he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24th, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, a key supporter of Ukraine, shortly before the anniversary. The threat of Russian missile attacks continued into the night of Saturday. In the capital Kyiv, an air raid warning was sounded for the fifth time that day late Friday evening. &quot;There is a threat of an attack with drones,&quot; the military administration of the Kyiv region announced. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign to split it off were thwarted by the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, the compromise of an infrastructure company was agreed, which, however, is to be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate or distribute profits.
renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to accompany this process. The backlog of renovations on the rail network is a major reason why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by the railway, however, they are closer to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: &quot;Can someone please pinch me?&quot;
The external circumstances obviously did not favor Herrmann-Wick. She said after the race that she had slept badly, that she was &quot;totally excited,&quot; and that her pulse had not calmed down even as she was running in. &quot;A race like that,&quot; and at the home World Championships, &quot;cannot be described in words,&quot; she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the blaring pop music with German flags, and the coaches and team hugged each other.
&quot;Enjoy biathlon&quot; was her plan
The pressure was particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She is currently fifth in the overall World Cup. And even though the level of performance among the women is significantly higher at the top than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, other people were more likely to be on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been very tense since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega&#39;s resignation found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the years that followed, often out of fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Armaments industry demands more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have already been cancelled, and other projects are at risk of being cancelled, as the &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; newspaper reports. It is not yet possible to say which investments would be cancelled. &quot;There is no need to allocate specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time,&quot; says the Federal Government in response to a query from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The reason for the falling investment sum is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which is fully financed by loans and which the Bundestag approved in June 2022, has to bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, less money will be available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is falling due to the currently high inflation.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (February 10th to 11th), at around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway at the Kupferzell exit in the direction of Heilbronn. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, according to the police. When the BMW driver turned, a collision occurred between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the scene of the accident showed &quot;green&quot; for them. An inspection of the traffic lights revealed no complaints. Further investigations are underway. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered a total of around 20,000 euros in property damage.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart residents commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is affecting the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart&#39;s Schlossplatz.
Many members of the community had responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam&#39;s prayer seriously and in silence. In the prayer, the imam asked Allah to help the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful treatment of one another. The community also asked for support and strength to &quot;bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake.&quot;
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in Glockenstraße over several days, which will be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
&quot;After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps&quot;.... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance in the years of the pandemic. Because those who, thanks to home offices, are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone&#39;s throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or instead for a walk out into the fresh air. At least that&#39;s the impression you might get around Lake Egglburg, where it&#39;s not just dog owners who are milling around between 12 and 2 p.m.
One reason could of course be that modern people can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things by making optimal use of their time slots. After all, why not take a short walk through nature to find out the latest news from the neighbor you haven&#39;t seen for a long time? Or meet the friend you never make it to the movies with in the evening, not even to the old cinema? This would also be a way to combine work and private life - who says that an appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can&#39;t take place outdoors? As long as there are no strangers nearby, of course.
Another excellent way to do this is to buy produce in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, which is placed on a table by the side of the road with a small box. Or potatoes and meat. It&#39;s just a shame if you haven&#39;t thought about the purchase beforehand and made the necessary arrangements. This is how an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg left the farmer&#39;s wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. &quot;It&#39;s a shame, we forgot the money.&quot;
The disappointment is understandable, as you have a companion with a wallet but no carrying case. This is what you let your friendly chance acquaintance know. To which the man replies: &quot;But that&#39;s not true! You do have a bag with you!&quot; He points to the hood of the jacket that you quickly threw on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes additional headgear superfluous. &quot;My wife always puts everything in there!&quot;
And so it happens that you start the journey back with meat on hand, and on this short midday excursion you have not only gained a saddle of lamb, but also a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be necessary that day - after dinner. This time, it is actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons that are still unclear, veered off the road to the right in a left-hand bend, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, hit a tree on the side and came to a stop a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. The fire brigade freed him using heavy equipment. The emergency services took the seriously injured man to hospital. As there was a suspicion that he was unfit to drive, a blood sample was taken. According to the police report, the Audi was a total write-off, amounting to 1,000 euros.
Donald Trump&#39;s tax documents: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided that the tax authority must hand over the former president&#39;s tax returns to Parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the ministry said in its decision on Friday.
Contrary to political custom in the USA, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not make his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought against the release of them all the way to the Supreme Court. A public prosecutor in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless a trial took place.
The release to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: the circle of those authorized to access the information is somewhat larger there and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee&#39;s investigation. In addition, confidential information is also often leaked from parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a &quot;victory for the rule of law.&quot; Access to the Republican&#39;s tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. &quot;The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President,&quot; Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays out between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which cell phone contract should you choose with so many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves to time, people today rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes just squeeze people and hamburgers in between. In her new program, Lucy van Kuhl shows that there is something exciting about the &quot;in-between&quot; state.
Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from real life in a humorous and thoughtful way. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of many things - and one or two things can also be found between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18th, at 8:30 p.m. in the Kirchheim club Bastion.
British criminal caught in Thailand after long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British criminal investigation agency NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA&#39;s &quot;Most Wanted&quot; list.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group fled in early 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the Church Table
Bielefeld
What will be served remains a secret in advance. People should come to the Vesperkirche primarily to meet other people, not because there is something specific on the menu. It starts this Sunday, when Neustadt&#39;s Marienkirche will become a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the trained physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statement, loves Viennese humor, champions science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo, &quot;Make Science Great Again,&quot; fits in with this. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing scepticism towards science in Vienna is another matter. In any case, his humor fits very well in Vienna.
The English title is also derived from Ebert&#39;s recent life story, as he spent a year in 2019 trying to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York. But now he&#39;s back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it can do - and, above all, what it can&#39;t do. Corona is also mentioned, of course, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, calmly and very ironically. And so you are not only well entertained, but you can also learn something in the process.
Please go get typed... it doesn&#39;t take long, doesn&#39;t hurt, and can save many people&#39;s lives.
My cell phone rings with an unknown number. I assume this woman is the honest finder of her wallet.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game shows the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley that is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock blocks that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs appear at regular intervals. These cannot attack the player&#39;s tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction mode, the game introduction mode, the game run-down, the initial input for maximum scores and the self-test mode. The latter mode is a special mode for checking the controls and the computer&#39;s function.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds are audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game begins with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left corner of the information display in his cockpit. A hint could be, for example: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a dot representing the enemy position becomes visible on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player&#39;s field of vision on the screen below. If the enemy is in this area, he can be easily targeted on the screen. At the same time, ENEMY IN FIRE AREA is displayed in the upper left information display.
UFOs will occasionally appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless flying objects that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player&#39;s tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by the radar. The UFOs are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player&#39;s tank and the enemy&#39;s tank. If the player shoots one down, the player gets 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player&#39;s tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks in a game. Furthermore, a bonus tank can be released after reaching a predetermined number of points and the appearance of the rocket can be varied to make the game even more difficult. Details and the exact switch positions of the game play selector for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initials input for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of the highest scores, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that if a self-test is triggered, the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB is pressed or the power is interrupted, the table with the highest scores is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players. Any score that is over 100,000 is also marked with a tank symbol followed by the player&#39;s initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer automatically enters dashes. After this, the device returns to the attraction game sequence. SETUP ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE unit has five (5) new components. If you are already familiar with ATARI video devices, you should note these important differences. The new parts are: A. The joystick. This is a redesign of the ATARI joystick. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, making this unit more stable and ensuring that the switch contacts function properly. Another change is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always brings the joystick back to the center position. The microswitches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI&#39;S X/Y game circuitry has been expanded to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Board. This switching technology generates more lines on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady picture. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply resulting from the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Thanks to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. The device also contains a console that is designed as a pedestal for smaller players to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation location.
These new components, as well as all other main components of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should still perform a certain check to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in good condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Check the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance cover of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check that all wiring harness connectors are correctly and firmly connected. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Never force the connectors into place. The connectors are designed with a positive guide to ensure a correct connection. A connector twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check that the plug connections to the game PC board are correctly and securely seated. (3) Note the serial number of the device on the rating plate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped serial number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the serial number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be quoted when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check that all other main components such as the power supply, control console and TV monitor are correctly installed. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player&#39;s viewing glass, check that the radar screen is also in the bright, orange-circled opening in the cover. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, make sure that the voltage selector plug on the power supply unit 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below you will find a series of tips that can help you resolve most problems related to current DirectX games. Checking your system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the box. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you are unsure if your PC meets the requirements. To run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, please follow these steps: Click the &quot;Start&quot; button and select the &quot;Run&quot; option. Type &quot;dxdiag&quot; in the text box. This will bring up the DirectX Diagnostic Tool interface. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about your graphics and sound card. You can check that graphics and sound are working properly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound, among other things. Note: Unless you have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
There may be other programs hogging the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious when they are active, and many start automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called &quot;background applications&quot;. In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, find the program&#39;s icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option (&quot;Disable&quot; &quot;Close&quot;, or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the &quot;How to close all unnecessary background applications&quot; section. Cleaning up the system
Before you install any software, you need to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to &quot;clean up&quot; your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup to ensure that everything is running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games will run on your PC with little problems. A &quot;clean&quot; system also has the advantage of being much more efficient, and therefore other applications that you use will run faster and more reliably. Consult the Windows Help files to find out about the ScanDisk, Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and select the Help (or Help and Support) option to access Windows Help. 2. Now click in the Search box and type the relevant keyword, such as &quot;ScanDisk&quot; (Win 98/ME), &quot;Error Checking&quot; (Win 2000/XP), &quot;Defragmentation&quot; and &quot;Disk Cleanup&quot;. You will then receive instructions explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or freezes?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try downloading the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer&#39;s website. Below are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new world of possibilities and seemed like a new means of expression that allowed the world to be pushed to its limits. It was a way to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: I was struggling with the still-immature technology, but I was also aware that there was still a lot to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years did not satisfy my hunger. I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on &quot;action&quot; and forgot a fundamental element of the human experience: sensation. Meanwhile, technology continued to advance at a rapid pace. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a real, emotionally expressive medium. While it could have been done in a completely different way, Fahrenheit&#39;s greatest achievement is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting boxes for ammo, but that has much more sophisticated and deeper content. It is proof that you can tell a story and offer gameplay without sacrificing narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are a bit skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your mindset. May other developers feel the desire to follow this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives over the past two years and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, repeatedly forcing us to question many of the principles we previously considered unshakeable. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - like the books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also leaves a lasting impression on you. David Cage

gameplay
Pressing the corresponding start button starts the game for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) two players. You must try to get as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum required area must be occupied before you can start the next area (round). The timed SPARX are shown at the top of the screen by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When the alarm is raised, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and become more aggressive. If your marker gets into the death spiral while you are trying to draw your area, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If you draw at a slow speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, providing data and demonstrating that circuits and controls are working properly. For more information, see &quot;Service Program&quot;. The volume can be adjusted using the VOLUME control on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches in the device, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) used for address programming and the game. The languages can be set using the &quot;Sub-Test&quot; switch. When the desired language appears - green -, press the &quot;Test&quot; switch to switch to the next program display. Bet programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a &quot;maximum number of credits&quot; that can be used before the game begins. The text to be changed is set by pressing the &quot;Sub-Test&quot; switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed using the &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; switch. The factory or basic setting can be reached by pressing the &quot;Sub-Test&quot; switch several times, when the bottom line (RESET line) is green, press the &quot;Up&quot; switch. The values are reset, the pointer (as the green appearing lines are called) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. &quot;Test&quot; always triggers the next program display. &quot;Back&quot; (reserve high score value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display up to &quot;High Hit Rate So Far&quot;. This value determines the required number of points/hits a player needs to have their own initials (names) and hit points entered on the screen. The &quot;Maximum Credit&quot; determines a coin acceptance limit for the machine. If the limit is exceeded, coin acceptance is blocked - if a coin lock is present. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that inserting a coin does not cause the credits to become zero when adding over 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting &quot;Maximum Credits&quot; to 0. Other programming: &quot;Number of Games&quot;: Number of markers per credit
&quot;Threshold&quot;: Level of the % that must be reached to switch to the next round
&quot;Time limit&quot;: Release for additional Sparx

The credits per coin are set on the &quot;Slot Programming&quot; display. High Score program display (highest hit rate so far&quot;). The player&#39;s hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set to high scores selected on the previous display (set from &quot;back&quot;). Pressing the &quot;Up&quot; switch sets the QIX default initials. Pressing the &quot;Test&quot; switch displays the next program display. The &quot;Total Score&quot;. Pressing the &quot;Up&quot; switch can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total Credit: The number of credits paid. The total is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts again. The total can only appear to 0 if the battery or the connector W1 is removed when the device is turned off. Left-hand coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-hand coins: Number of coins inserted in the right Coin slot - coins inserted. Credits paid: number of credits given for coins inserted (converted). Credits granted: number of credits given by the machine. % Free spins: credits granted (credits paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: number of minutes played. Minutes won: number of minutes played or won. % Free time: minutes won/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in seconds: minutes played/credits paid + credits granted
High Score (hit rate): Number of times a player had a high enough hit rate to push other players out of the high score list. Pressing the &quot;Up&quot; button resets the values to 0. Pressing the &quot;Test&quot; button brings up the next program display.
Slot programming/normal coin setting. This display allows the operator to select a standard coin setting or program a different setting
If a standard setting is required, programming is selected by pressing the &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; buttons while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached, pressing the &quot;Test&quot; button accepts the setting. If a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting is desired, the values can be adjusted by pressing the &quot;Sub-Test&quot; button. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that custom adjustment is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment effort by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that do not fit. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be adjusted can be selected by pressing the &quot;Sub-Test&quot; button. If pressed accidentally, the standard setting appears. The &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; buttons can be used to increase or decrease the values. Pressing the &quot;Test&quot; button ends the process. The Coin Multiplier (&quot;Coin Unit&quot;) tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin Units - &quot;Credit&quot; shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. &quot;Bonus&quot; Coin Units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. &quot;Min. Coin&quot; is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. This value is not used by default &quot;0&quot;. CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If &quot;Memory Failure - Service Required&quot; appears on the display, the CMOS RAM in which all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory defaults. This condition probably indicates battery failure or fault.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start the test procedure. Press the &quot;Sub-Test&quot; switch or the &quot;Self-Test&quot; button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered at the respective program display, pressing the &quot;Test&quot; switch will display the next program. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the Auto-Test mode. In this program the unit will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the &quot;Open Coin Door to Test&quot; display appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If plug J 19 is unplugged, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware Tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the unit stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the ROM checksum fails, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decode connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAMs fail during the Video Board test, the error may be caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data Board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or the decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences are checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The Display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writes are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy will cause the program to halt and the LEDs will indicate the faulty RAM. If a Display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this diagnostic does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it will indicate that the next test is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for star number 1. The second one is that the correct jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had based my decision on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in size L. Because it is supposed to fit so tightly and I didn&#39;t want to struggle to get an S or M with my bust size... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and hips... the rest of it was fine. In addition, the lining material came out when you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame... It will be returned :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. It can be worn on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter and she is absolutely delighted. She usually wears size 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will definitely be worn next year too. We can recommend ordering one.
Robust quality
I decided on the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the car jack and that is not ideal. Unfortunately I measured incorrectly and the pad does not fit completely. But that is my fault. I then changed something slightly so that it fits. The pad seems very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is OK, but not for children under one year old. The chewing surface is much too big for a small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn&#39;t use it because of the size. Now that he&#39;s 12 months old, we&#39;ve dug it out again and he can use it. He still can&#39;t bite on anything with the few teeth he already has. And when it&#39;s been in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately will be returned
I was probably blinded by some of the effusive reviews. I would like to say in advance that I already use 2 Lowepro backpacks. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now finally become too small and I need a replacement. I bought this backpack on Prime Day for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, I was disappointed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that&#39;s not something you can say. But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices... people, that&#39;s just not true! I really hoped that it was like that, but there&#39;s really no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same level of protection as my Lowepro. The dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are also not exactly high quality. So I have decided to return the backpack. If I buy equipment worth several thousand euros, then unfortunately I have to spend the money on a decent backpack. Quality seems to have its price here. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it&#39;s not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked was the color inside. You can definitely find your things much faster here than with a gray interior. For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
Up until now, I had liked EL Todd&#39;s Electric series the best, but this book changed my opinion. I found the first two books very strong and recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. This part is all about Volt and Taylor&#39;s feelings and I thought it was unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself and then acts like a little child at every argument and disappears?! At the same time, I felt there were also inconsistencies, because at the end of the second part, Volt tried to convince Taylor&#39;s ex and didn&#39;t believe him when he said Taylor fancied him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn&#39;t live without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time pretty unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor&#39;s friend Sarah is Volt&#39;s ex. That would bring more excitement to the story.
People destroy everything, don&#39;t appreciate anything and don&#39;t learn from it! First of all: the film isn&#39;t as bad as many people say. Sure, the story is completely contrived and always follows the same formula. If you&#39;ve seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: people destroy everything, don&#39;t appreciate anything and don&#39;t learn from it! And that&#39;s exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often have I thought while watching the film (even though I know it&#39;s just a film and the animals are computer-generated): Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to your eyes. In that sense, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It&#39;s just a shame that people just don&#39;t get the message behind the film, even though it&#39;s a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves too. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living creatures: None. 4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always following the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Still, well made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some people expect a film like 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn&#39;t want to be one. This film is above all &quot;French&quot; - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and will make you cry - if you get involved with it and don&#39;t expect anything from it that it doesn&#39;t want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, because of the orange, but that doesn&#39;t matter. A packet every morning for 5 days: nothing has changed, absolutely nothing. My waist has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite stopping immediately, the diarrhea has continued for a week. It should be noted that the smaller package size was only given 2 stars (unfortunately I only saw it too late), while the larger one got a full 5? That&#39;s very, very strange!
horrible smell and poor results! I dyed my blonde hair chocolate brown in October with an intensive tint, and in February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible! However, the result was not too bad, it came out a bit like chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I didn&#39;t get the result I wanted, I used it again, as the instructions said even if I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the result. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first time. The worst thing was that it still stank weeks after I had used it. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn&#39;t go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now, one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin levels have been low for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a long illness. I wanted to give my immune system a boost not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This is working very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed more easily. The price is also great because you have to consider how long you can take the tablets for. Highly recommended.
Function not quite perfect!!! After using the battery case for 3 months, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying: 1) Over time, the case has problems &quot;connecting&quot; to the phone. This means that it no longer charges even if you have pressed the &quot;Power On/Off&quot; button for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and put it back in, the problem is solved in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequently removing and putting the phone back in the case, the cover is now so worn that it comes off the case on its own, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in terms of its function and so, for the cost of €30, I am very disappointed with the product, especially as I have only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don&#39;t know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it&#39;s actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get as a gift in a smaller version from any optician. The cleaning effect is as good as that of a kitchen towel and no better. I expected a lot more from these cloths and they are also really very thin. Unfortunately, since I&#39;ve used them, I can&#39;t exchange them. I&#39;m disappointed and can&#39;t recommend them to anyone. The price for these cloths is way too high and you shouldn&#39;t pay more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a freebie, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I dropped it in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... you obviously have to water the suction cup otherwise it comes off... it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes... what I am critical of is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in terms of volume. Unfortunately, that is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to deduct a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
The paint was chipped in a few places and if you just ran your hand over it, the paint came off in some places. We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn&#39;t want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but it would be as if both chests of drawers were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer. Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money. A compliment to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. The product is delivered in individual parts that you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. As the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn&#39;t complain, as I urgently needed this product. The adhesive supplied barely sticks, but it sticks well - like chewing gum that doesn&#39;t harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. As the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it still wasn&#39;t dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that everything doesn&#39;t stick together. Some of the stencils are incompletely punched out. OK for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but for a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I&#39;m not dissatisfied. The cupboard looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions aren&#39;t that clear. + Magnetic closures + Nice look + Stable when assembled + Shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors bang due to magnets (maybe this can be compensated with rubber studs) - some dirty spots
- the dowels supplied are much too small and wobble (I didn&#39;t have any other ones and as there was no trophy in the house I stuck them on with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a little (I wrapped it in some paper and leveled it out) Conclusion: If it didn&#39;t look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give it fewer stars, as you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. I also think it&#39;s a little too expensive for that.
I like the coffee...but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately the coffee does not flow through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible and extremely loud. I couldn&#39;t turn them down either. Probably a defect, although apparently that&#39;s possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud for me, I immediately fell out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning. But when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, but unfortunately you can&#39;t dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so that you don&#39;t have to re-enter the clock and alarm time in the event of a power failure. But I returned it for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, workmanship insufficient
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board was smiling at me in this place... There was nothing in the box either. &quot;Pay for 6 - get 4&quot; is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have dealt with this quickly and accommodatingly, but I only discovered this after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deducted. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly lit. The light color is more towards cold white. Perfect for hallways, studies, workshops, laundry rooms, etc. For living rooms, I would personally go for warmer light. Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do this too and I may even get intact examples there according to the order. If my review is of any help, I would be happy to receive a positive review. I will try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first impression. Yes, positive. I thought for a long time about whether to order this set or not. **The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole in the handle so they can be hung up **The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on pans with a coating. **They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They also do not conduct heat and can therefore be touched directly. **The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But after a quick wipe they are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it
B-stock sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping is simply top notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock: we unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts. We noticed that the part had already been installed before. We found significant scratches and abrasions on all the assembly parts. The screw connections/hose connectors were all damaged. Despite this, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that there were scratch marks/streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part had probably been delivered before and then sent back. We are keeping this faucet and installing it in the sink in the basement because it doesn&#39;t matter what it looks like there. Our conclusion: We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but would rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we can get decent goods. I just find it sad that customers are being ripped off like this!!!
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after only 6 months
In principle, I am very happy with this product. Installation was very easy and the wireless range is very good, and there are no problems with transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact and continues to show plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is broken, as it always shows completely astronomical values for the outside humidity. That is a real shame, as the device was installed outside in a protected place and is also the reason why I am only giving this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak grass catcher
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still happily travelling across the country with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon&#39;s service in arranging a replacement delivery was, as always, excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The motor is powerful and it produces a nice cut. The noise level is not exactly impressively low, but OK. Unfortunately, the big drawback is the grass catcher. Firstly, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down full for just a short time, it will of course be compressed and some of the contents will fall out. What&#39;s worse, however, is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the grass catcher is half full. That wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the mower didn&#39;t lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Emptying the basket every time it&#39;s only half full on a large lawn is not the solution. So I cleaned the device as well as I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. The plug-in sensor cable that is included is very good and can be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery power they are only shown in the app once or three times a day (adjustable). I am only giving it 4 stars for the following reasons: - The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is quite fiddly to close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses its connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect on its own, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven&#39;t managed to level the hotbed properly. The rear right locking screw is fully tightened but the hotbed is still too high there and the screw at the front right practically falls out because it isn&#39;t tightened at all even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Perhaps someone knows what can be done because it&#39;s impossible to print anything like this. About the assembly: The assembly was pretty problem-free; they could just show how to lay the cables because otherwise you&#39;d have to re-lay them several times, which is very tiring. I&#39;ve already written to support but after waiting a week I still haven&#39;t received a response. Unfortunately, sending it back isn&#39;t an option either. I was expecting a bit more.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper stopped working after many years, so I needed a new one. This one seems very robust and, after several test measurements, is just as precise. It comes with two batteries, so you can get started right away. The caliper&#39;s packaging is simple, but it serves its purpose perfectly. Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper. I would definitely recommend buying it, and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and haven&#39;t worn it for a while because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell hasn&#39;t gone away, even though it&#39;s been &quot;aired&quot; constantly. Since it&#39;s no longer possible to return it, I&#39;ve thrown it away. I would advise against buying it.
OK for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls can move freely, which I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simply made overall, so I&#39;ve already ripped the clasp open twice. So far I&#39;ve always been able to repair it, but I don&#39;t think it will work/last for long. But for the low price you simply can&#39;t expect anything really high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can&#39;t come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with a little leather conditioner, which makes it a little softer and more supple. But if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, it&#39;s junk! I was disappointed as soon as I unpacked it because the small displays on the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was a used product. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after a bit of playing around... if you follow the instructions, it doesn&#39;t work at all. Only after I removed a battery from the base station and put a new one in did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy didn&#39;t last long because after just an hour the connection was lost again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three transmitters was also very different! All in all, it was useless for me! The thing went back! I would definitely advise against buying it, it&#39;s just a hassle!
transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, but unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread on the internal shaft had rusted away. I only bought it again for one reason: I needed it urgently because of the current drought, and I knew the connections on the suction and discharge lines would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a manufacturing defect and that the current pump will last a little longer. Unfortunately the new pump was damaged in transit; the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packaging the pump better in future rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump&#39;s performance.
They could have thought this through better. Since I often have to deal with lots of different keys, I thought an organizer like this would be more convenient than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first everything went well. However, the paint came off pretty quickly and the screws always had to be retightened. It&#39;s nice that you can do this with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn&#39;t find a suitable slotted screwdriver that wouldn&#39;t immediately ruin the whole screw. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It&#39;s nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths using the different parts, but once you&#39;ve screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to take it apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. Ultimately, the third time I assembled it, the screw broke off in the thread and the whole thing was unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then only get all the necessary keys once and then never again, but for that price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material seems robust and everything is lightweight. Since I have nothing to compare it to (my first organizer set), I won&#39;t be able to really judge the product until I use it for the first time. I can already say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can&#39;t really imagine packing everything in there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large items can go straight into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that 10 items were delivered instead of 8, as the round cosmetic bag also contained two smaller bags/pouches. The workmanship is not high quality, but I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag is a different color and made of a different material than the other bags doesn&#39;t bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that&#39;s OK.
So-so
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn&#39;t work anymore. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn&#39;t work. I might as well have thrown the money straight in the trash.
Care is always good! It is easy to use, but you have to be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear any improvement in the sound on my very high-quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. They came with two black cables. The battery lasts a long time. The sound is definitely completely adequate. I liked that the headphones don&#39;t hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are really soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also very low. I would recommend buying them in this price range.
chic dress
Very beautiful dress that can be worn for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is perfect, especially as I bought it in a flash offer. It fits my size perfectly, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t order a smaller size (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn&#39;t so low, and the sleeves could do with a bit more fabric (if your upper arms aren&#39;t as narrow as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It can&#39;t get any worse. I really and seriously didn&#39;t expect that such junk would be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Despite this, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs work normally, but Blu-rays are only recognized very unreliably. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes a rattling noise that hasn&#39;t been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing is happening, or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not under any circumstances press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the film or anything else. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or something similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it&#39;s supposed to, but it&#39;s not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually just a gimmick, because only the port that faces upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn&#39;t know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn&#39;t have bought this shapeless lump with gold plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And thanks to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick doesn&#39;t just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So it&#39;s not really a bad buy, but my euphoria is limited :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With iOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I have already had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Charging at the same time is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn&#39;t fit with the adapter. Well, it holds securely anyway and has contact so... All in all, it&#39;s a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. The whole thing is also very small and made from a sturdy piece of aluminum. Price/performance ratio is good.
Lots of power
Great device. Has been running for months without any problems. It&#39;s not exactly light or quiet but it delivers decent performance. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and so I always use level 2. It&#39;s also fallen onto the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not give a cheap impression. When in use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can recommend them without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We&#39;ve had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised - in live mode the location feels accurate to within 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it likes to jump a few meters, but it&#39;s not a problem. I would buy it again any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. At the moment it lasts about 1.5 hours a day. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it&#39;s too big for our liking - the battery wouldn&#39;t last that long and we find changing it every day impractical. You&#39;re supposed to be busy with the dog, not with its collar :-) . The app worked perfectly too.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable. However, their lifespan is getting shorter and shorter. Although my son only wears the shoes in PE lessons, the soles break after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair didn&#39;t last very long in normal use either, but I thought they would be enough for lessons. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case. The shoes are expensive rubbish and I absolutely don&#39;t recommend them.
Fits perfectly - but are they original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these ones are poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap on the heel is quite loose and most likely won&#39;t last five years like my previous ones. I&#39;m excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on a whim. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) to test it out. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it won&#39;t appear again. I immediately carried out a lying test while it was inflated. It is comfortable to lie on and is a great fit for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully in my car. We took the back seats out beforehand. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car&#39;s cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point). Since my boyfriend is good at DIY, he was able to repair it and when put back together, the thing worked perfectly and pumped up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I&#39;m very impressed with the mattress. I&#39;m excited about the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it doesn&#39;t lose air and lasts a long time. And that the mold doesn&#39;t appear again. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I have any other experiences, I&#39;ll revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than €10... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the toy idea. Unfortunately, the calendar ripped open across several doors on day 1 due to the silly workmanship. By the 21st door, there were no doors left and I more or less had to allow my son to take out the remaining parts as they had practically fallen out of his hands. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to take the car apart again to put the parts back on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off when playing. (Especially the windshield. This is also very difficult to put back on.) I wouldn&#39;t buy this calendar again and wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone. Perhaps the manufacturers will rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am delighted with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually more than enough. Given the price, I expected hair to get caught in it and the drone to break very quickly, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether it&#39;s tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
The game is OK but you can only play it if you have to use Steam. When I bought it I didn&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t a game CD but just a code that you can use to download the game. That would be OK, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is ridiculous. Since then the computer keeps crashing, which would definitely not be the case if I had just installed the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance are great, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. It was easy to use... but I&#39;m still sending it back. The big problem: the battery and its lifespan. Charged in the evening, left on the cupboard overnight and in the morning the battery was 11% less if not used. If I received a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already dead by midday/early afternoon and then you couldn&#39;t even tell the time. So it&#39;s not useful for me. A real shame.
Noble case with limitations
You should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. I&#39;ve recently liked cases that you can also put your credit card in. This is what the case here offers. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it becomes too much and the lid sticks up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case looks robust and seems to be well made. It looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, only the connections are cut out. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. It doesn&#39;t even work on the QI leather charging station from TORRO. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise, really stylish and well made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film
Robust case with a real tempered glass to protect the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and is also easy to put on. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and sits firmly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
